      "Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior Its subject matter includes the behavior of humans and nonhumans both conscious and unconscious phenomena and mental processes such as thoughts feelings and motives Psychology is an academic discipline of immense scope crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences Biological psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains linking the discipline to neuroscience As social scientists psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist Some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior Others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors Psychologists are involved in research on perception cognition attention emotion intelligence subjective experiences motivation brain functioning and personality Psychologists interests extend to interpersonal relationships psychological resilience family resilience and other areas within social psychology They also consider the unconscious mind Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables Some but not all clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role practicing psychotherapy in clinical counseling or school settings Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings eg universities medical schools or hospitals Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings Yet others are involved in work on human development aging sports health forensic science education and the media Etymology and definitions The word psychology derives from the Greek word psyche for spirit or soul The latter part of the word psychology derives from logia which means study or research The word psychology was first used in the Renaissance In its Latin form psychiologia it was first employed by the Croatian humanist and Latinist Marko Maruli in his book Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae Psychology on the Nature of the Human Soul in the decade 15101520 The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary The dictionary refers to Anatomy which treats the Body and Psychology which treats of the Soul psi the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived is commonly associated with the field of psychology In 1890 William James defined psychology as the science of mental life both of its phenomena and their conditions This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades However this meaning was contested notably by radical behaviorists such as John B Watson who in 1913 asserted that the discipline is a natural science the theoretical goal of which is the prediction and control of behavior Since James defined psychology the term more strongly implicates scientific experimentation Folk psychology is the understanding of the mental states and behaviors of people held by ordinary people as contrasted with psychology professionals understanding History The ancient civilizations of Egypt Greece China India and Persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology In Ancient Egypt the Ebers Papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders Historians note that Greek philosophers including Thales Plato and Aristotle especially in his De Anima treatise addressed the workings of the mind As early as the 4th century BC the Greek physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes In 387 BCE Plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place and in 335 BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart In China psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of Laozi and Confucius and later from the doctrines of Buddhism This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting It frames the universe in term of a division of physical reality and mental reality as well as the interaction between the physical and the mental Chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power An ancient text known as The Yellow Emperors Classic of Internal Medicine identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation includes theories of personality based on yinyang balance and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria Chinese scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the Qing dynasty with the work of Westerneducated Fang Yizhi 16111671 Liu Zhi 16601730 and Wang Qingren 17681831 Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system linked mental disorder with brain diseases investigated the causes of dreams and insomnia and advanced a theory of hemispheric lateralization in brain function Influenced by Hinduism Indian philosophy explored distinctions in types of awareness A central idea of the Upanishads and other Vedic texts that formed the foundations of Hinduism was the distinction between a persons transient mundane self and their eternal unchanging soul Divergent Hindu doctrines and Buddhism have challenged this hierarchy of selves but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness Yoga encompasses a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal Theosophy a religion established by RussianAmerican philosopher Helena Blavatsky drew inspiration from these doctrines during her time in British India Psychology was of interest to Enlightenment thinkers in Europe In Germany Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz 16461716 applied his principles of calculus to the mind arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum He suggested that the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree Christian Wolff identified psychology as its own science writing Psychologia Empirica in 1732 and Psychologia Rationalis in 1734 Immanuel Kant advanced the idea of anthropology as a discipline with psychology an important subdivision Kant however explicitly rejected the idea of an experimental psychology writing that the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object In 1783 Ferdinand Ueberwasser 17521812 designated himself Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic and gave lectures on scientific psychology though these developments were soon overshadowed by the Napoleonic Wars At the end of the Napoleonic era Prussian authorities discontinued the Old University of Mnster Having consulted philosophers Hegel and Herbart however in 1825 the Prussian state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential educational system However this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation In England early psychology involved phrenology and the response to social problems including alcoholism violence and the countrys crowded lunatic asylums Beginning of experimental psychology Philosopher John Stuart Mill believed that the human mind was open to scientific investigation even if the science is in some ways inexact Mill proposed a mental chemistry in which elementary thoughts could combine into ideas of greater complexity Gustav Fechner began conducting psychophysics research in Leipzig in the 1830s He articulated the principle that human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity 61 The principle became known as the WeberFechner law Fechners 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kants negative view with regard to conducting quantitative research on the mind Fechners achievement was to show that mental processes could not only be given numerical magnitudes but also that these could be measured by experimental methods In Heidelberg Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt Wundt in turn came to Leipzig University where he established the psychological laboratory that brought experimental psychology to the world Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of materials Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential laboratory at Leipzig a psychologyrelated lab that focused more on experimental psychiatry James McKeen Cattell a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and the cofounder of Psychological Review was the first professor of psychology in the United States The German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus a researcher at the University of Berlin was a 19thcentury contributor to the field He pioneered the experimental study of memory and developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting In the early 20th century Wolfgang Kohler Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka cofounded the school of Gestalt psychology of Fritz Perls The approach of Gestalt psychology is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes Rather than reducing thoughts and behavior into smaller component elements as in structuralism the Gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important and differs from the sum of its parts Psychologists in Germany Denmark Austria England and the United States soon followed Wundt in setting up laboratories G Stanley Hall an American who studied with Wundt founded a psychology lab that became internationally influential The lab was located at Johns Hopkins University Hall in turn trained Yujiro Motora who brought experimental psychology emphasizing psychophysics to the Imperial University of Tokyo Wundts assistant Hugo Mnsterberg taught psychology at Harvard to students such as Narendra Nath Sen Guptawho in 1905 founded a psychology department and laboratory at the University of Calcutta Wundts students Walter Dill Scott Lightner Witmer and James McKeen Cattell worked on developing tests of mental ability Cattell who also studied with eugenicist Francis Galton went on to found the Psychological Corporation Witmer focused on the mental testing of children Scott on employee selection 60 Another student of Wundt the Englishman Edward Titchener created the psychology program at Cornell University and advanced structuralist psychology The idea behind structuralism was to analyze and classify different aspects of the mind primarily through the method of introspection William James John Dewey and Harvey Carr advanced the idea of functionalism an expansive approach to psychology that underlined the Darwinian idea of a behaviors usefulness to the individual In 1890 James wrote an influential book The Principles of Psychology which expanded on the structuralism He memorably described stream of consciousness Jamess ideas interested many American students in the emerging discipline 17882 Dewey integrated psychology with societal concerns most notably by promoting progressive education inculcating moral values in children and assimilating immigrants 196200 A different strain of experimentalism with a greater connection to physiology emerged in South America under the leadership of Horacio G Piero at the University of Buenos Aires In Russia too researchers placed greater emphasis on the biological basis for psychology beginning with Ivan Sechenovs 1873 essay Who Is to Develop Psychology and How Sechenov advanced the idea of brain reflexes and aggressively promoted a deterministic view of human behavior The RussianSoviet physiologist Ivan Pavlov discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed classical conditioning and applied the process to human beings Consolidation and funding One of the earliest psychology societies was La Socit de Psychologie Physiologique in France which lasted from 1885 to 1893 The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology sponsored by the International Union of Psychological Science took place in Paris in August 1889 amidst the Worlds Fair celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution William James was one of three Americans among the 400 attendees The American Psychological Association APA was founded soon after in 1892 The International Congress continued to be held at different locations in Europe and with wide international participation The Sixth Congress held in Geneva in 1909 included presentations in Russian Chinese and Japanese as well as Esperanto After a hiatus for World War I the Seventh Congress met in Oxford with substantially greater participation from the warvictorious AngloAmericans In 1929 the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven Connecticut attended by hundreds of members of the APA Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing new psychology to the East New ideas about psychology diffused from Japan into China American psychology gained status upon the USs entry into World War I A standing committee headed by Robert Yerkes administered mental tests Army Alpha and Army Beta to almost 18 million soldiers Subsequently the Rockefeller family via the Social Science Research Council began to provide funding for behavioral research Rockefeller charities funded the National Committee on Mental Hygiene which disseminated the concept of mental illness and lobbied for applying ideas from psychology to child rearing Through the Bureau of Social Hygiene and later funding of Alfred Kinsey Rockefeller foundations helped establish research on sexuality in the US Under the influence of the Carnegiefunded Eugenics Record Office the Draperfunded Pioneer Fund and other institutions the eugenics movement also influenced American psychology In the 1910s and 1920s eugenics became a standard topic in psychology classes In contrast to the US in the UK psychology was met with antagonism by the scientific and medical establishments and up until 1939 there were only six psychology chairs in universities in England During World War II and the Cold War the US military and intelligence agencies established themselves as leading funders of psychology by way of the armed forces and in the new Office of Strategic Services intelligence agency University of Michigan psychologist Dorwin Cartwright reported that university researchers began largescale propaganda research in 19391941 He observed that the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the weekbyweekpropaganda policy for the United States Government Cartwright also wrote that psychologists had significant roles in managing the domestic economy The Army rolled out its new General Classification Test to assess the ability of millions of soldiers The Army also engaged in largescale psychological research of troop morale and mental health In the 1950s the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency CIA to fund research on psychological warfare In 1965 public controversy called attention to the Armys Project Camelot the Manhattan Project of social science an effort which enlisted psychologists and anthropologists to analyze the plans and policies of foreign countries for strategic purposes In Germany after World War I psychology held institutional power through the military which was subsequently expanded along with the rest of the military during Nazi Germany Under the direction of Hermann Grings cousin Matthias Gring the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute was renamed the Gring Institute Freudian psychoanalysts were expelled and persecuted under the antiJewish policies of the Nazi Party and all psychologists had to distance themselves from Freud and Adler founders of psychoanalysis who were also Jewish The Gring Institute was wellfinanced throughout the war with a mandate to create a New German Psychotherapy This psychotherapy aimed to align suitable Germans with the overall goals of the Reich As described by one physician Despite the importance of analysis spiritual guidance and the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental problems and to subordinate them to the requirements of the Volk and the Gemeinschaft Psychologists were to provide Seelenfhrung lit soul guidance the leadership of the mind to integrate people into the new vision of a German community Harald SchultzHencke melded psychology with the Nazi theory of biology and racial origins criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed Johannes Heinrich Schultz a German psychologist recognized for developing the technique of autogenic training prominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable and devised techniques for facilitating this process After the war new institutions were created although some psychologists because of their Nazi affiliation were discredited Alexander Mitscherlich founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called Psyche With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation Mitscherlich established the first clinical psychosomatic medicine division at Heidelberg University In 1970 psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students After the Russian Revolution the Bolsheviks promoted psychology as a way to engineer the New Man of socialism Consequently university psychology departments trained large numbers of students in psychology At the completion of training positions were made available for those students at schools workplaces cultural institutions and in the military The Russian state emphasized pedology and the study of child development Lev Vygotsky became prominent in the field of child development The Bolsheviks also promoted free love and embraced the doctrine of psychoanalysis as an antidote to sexual repression 846 Although pedology and intelligence testing fell out of favor in 1936 psychology maintained its privileged position as an instrument of the Soviet Union Stalinist purges took a heavy toll and instilled a climate of fear in the profession as elsewhere in Soviet society 22 Following World War II Jewish psychologists past and present including Lev Vygotsky AR Luria and Aron Zalkind were denounced Ivan Pavlov posthumously and Stalin himself were celebrated as heroes of Soviet psychology 256 489 Soviet academics experienced a degree of liberalization during the Khrushchev Thaw The topics of cybernetics linguistics and genetics became acceptable again The new field of engineering psychology emerged The field involved the study of the mental aspects of complex jobs such as pilot and cosmonaut Interdisciplinary studies became popular and scholars such as Georgy Shchedrovitsky developed systems theory approaches to human behavior 2733 Twentiethcentury Chinese psychology originally modeled itself on US psychology with translations from American authors like William James the establishment of university psychology departments and journals and the establishment of groups including the Chinese Association of Psychological Testing 1930 and the Chinese Psychological Society 1937 Chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and language learning Chinese psychologists were drawn to the idea that education would enable modernization John Dewey who lectured to Chinese audiences between 1919 and 1921 had a significant influence on psychology in China Chancellor Tsai Yuanpei introduced him at Peking University as a greater thinker than Confucius Kuo Zingyang who received a PhD at the University of California Berkeley became President of Zhejiang University and popularized behaviorism 59 After the Chinese Communist Party gained control of the country the Stalinist Soviet Union became the major influence with MarxismLeninism the leading social doctrine and Pavlovian conditioning the approved means of behavior change Chinese psychologists elaborated on Lenins model of a reflective consciousness envisioning an active consciousness pinyin tzuchueh nengtungli able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle They developed a concept of recognition pinyin jenshih which referred to the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview failure to correspond with party doctrine was incorrect recognition 917 Psychology education was centralized under the Chinese Academy of Sciences supervised by the State Council In 1951 the academy created a Psychology Research Office which in 1956 became the Institute of Psychology Because most leading psychologists were educated in the United States the first concern of the academy was the reeducation of these psychologists in the Soviet doctrines Child psychology and pedagogy for the purpose of a nationally cohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline 1824 Women in psychology 19001949 Women in the early 1900s started to make key findings within the world of psychology In 1923 Anna Freud the daughter of Sigmund Freud built on her fathers work using different defense mechanisms denial repression and suppression to psychoanalyze children She believed that once a child reached the latency period child analysis could be used as a mode of therapy She stated it is important focus on the childs environment support their development and prevent neurosis She believed a child should be recognized as their own person with their own right and have each session catered to the childs specific needs She encouraged drawing moving freely and expressing themselves in any way This helped build a strong therapeutic alliance with child patients which allows psychologists to observe their normal behavior She continued her research on the impact of children after family separation children with socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and all stages of child development from infancy to adolescence Functional periodicity the belief women are mentally and physically impaired during menstruation impacted womens rights because employers were less likely to hire them due to the belief they would be incapable of working for 1 week a month Leta Stetter Hollingworth wanted to prove this hypothesis and Edward L Thorndikes theory that women have lesser psychological and physical traits than men and were simply mediocre incorrect Hollingworth worked to prove differences were not from male genetic superiority but from culture She also included the concept of womens impairment during menstruation in her research She recorded both women and men performances on tasks cognitive perceptual and motor for three months No evidence was found of decreased performance due to a womans menstrual cycle She also challenged the belief intelligence is inherited and women here are intellectually inferior to men She stated that women do not reach positions of power due to the societal norms and roles they are assigned As she states in her article Variability as related to sex differences in achievement A Critique the largest problem women have is the social order that was built due to the assumption women have less interests and abilities than men To further prove her point she completed another experiment with infants who have not been influenced by the environment of social norms like the adult male getting more opportunities than women She found no difference between infants besides size After this research proved the original hypothesis wrong Hollingworth was able to show there is no difference between the physiological and psychological traits of men and women and women are not impaired during menstruation The first half of the 1900s was filled with new theories and it was a turning point for womens recognition within the field of psychology In addition to the contributions made by Leta Stetter Hollingworth and Anna Freud Mary Whiton Calkins invented the paired associates technique of studying memory and developed selfpsychology Karen Horney developed the concept of womb envy and neurotic needs Psychoanalyst Melanie Klein impacted developmental psychology with her research of play therapy These great discoveries and contributions were made during struggles of sexism discrimination and little recognition for their work 19501999 Women in the second half of the 20th century continued to do research that had largescale impacts on the field of psychology Mary Ainsworths work centered around attachment theory Building off fellow psychologist John Bowlby Ainsworth spent years doing fieldwork to understand the development of motherinfant relationships In doing this field research Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation Procedure a laboratory procedure meant to study attachment style by separating and uniting a child with their mother several different times under different circumstances These field studies are also where she developed her attachment theory and the order of attachment styles which was a landmark for developmental psychology Because of her work Ainsworth became one of the most cited psychologists of all time Mamie Phipps Clark was another woman in psychology that changed the field with her research She was one of the first AfricanAmericans to receive a doctoral degree in psychology from Columbia University along with her husband Kenneth Clark Her masters thesis The Development of Consciousness in Negro PreSchool Children argued that black childrens selfesteem was negatively impacted by racial discrimination She and her husband conduced research building off her thesis throughout the 1940s These tests called the doll tests asked young children to choose between identical dolls whose only difference was race and they found that the majority of the children preferred the white dolls and attributed positive traits to them Repeated over and over again these tests helped to determine the negative effects of racial discrimination and segregation on black childrens selfimage and development In 1954 this research would help decide the landmark Brown v Board of Education decision leading to the end of legal segregation across the nation Clark went on to be an influential figure in psychology her work continuing to focus on minority youth As the field of psychology developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century women in the field advocated for their voices to be heard and their perspectives to be valued Secondwave feminism did not miss psychology An outspoken feminist in psychology was Naomi Weisstein who was an accomplished researcher in psychology and neuroscience and is perhaps best known for her paper Kirche Kuche Kinder as Scientific Law Psychology Constructs the Female Psychology Constructs the Female criticized the field of psychology for centering men and using biology too much to explain gender differences without taking into account social factors Her work set the stage for further research to be done in social psychology especially in gender construction Other women in the field also continued advocating for women in psychology creating the Association for Women in Psychology to criticize how the field treated women E Kitsch Child Phyllis Chesler and Dorothy Riddle were some of the founding members of the organization in 1969 The latter half of the 20th century further diversified the field of psychology with women of color reaching new milestones In 1962 Martha Bernal became the first Latina woman to get a PhD in psychology In 1969 Marigold Linton the first Native American woman to get a PhD in psychology founded the National Indian Education Association She was also a founding member of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science In 1971 The Network of Indian Psychologists was established by Carolyn Attneave Harriet McAdoo was appointed to the White House Conference on Families in 1979 21st century Dr Kay Redfield Jamison named one of Time Magazines Best Doctors in the United States is a lecturer psychologist and writer She is known for her vast modern contributions to bipolar disorder and her books An Unquiet Mind Published 1995 and Nothing Was the Same Published in 2009 Having Bipolar Disorder herself she has written several memoirs about her experience with suicidal thoughts manic behaviors depression and other issues that arise from being Bipolar Dr Angela NealBarnett views psychology through a Black lens and dedicated her career to focusing on the anxiety of African American women She founded the organization Rise Sally Rise which helps Black women cope with anxiety She published her work Soothe Your Nerves The Black Womans Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Anxiety Panic and Fear in 2003 In 2002 Dr Teresa LaFromboise former president of the Society of Indian Psychologists received the APAs Distinguished Career Contribution to Research Award from the Society for the Psychological Study of Culture Ethnicity and Race for her research on suicide prevention She was the first person to lead an intervention for Native American children and adolescents that utilized evidencebased suicide prevention She has spent her career dedicated to aiding racial and ethnic minority youth cope with cultural adjustment and pressures Dr Shari MilesCohen a psychologist and political activist has applied a black feminist and class lens to all her psychological studies Aiding progressive and womens issues she has been the executive director for many NGOs In 2007 she became the Senior Director of the Womens Programs Office of the American Psychological Association Therefore she was one of the creators of the APAs Women in Psychology Timeline which features the accomplishments of women of color in psychology She is well known for coediting Eliminating Inequities for Women with Disabilities An Agenda for Health and Wellness published in 2016 her article published in the Womens Reproductive Health Journal about women of colors struggle with pregnancy and postpartum Published in 2018 and coauthoring the APA Handbook of the Psychology of Women published in 2019 Disciplinary organizations Institutions In 1920 douard Claparde and Pierre Bovet created a new applied psychology organization called the International Congress of Psychotechnics Applied to Vocational Guidance later called the International Congress of Psychotechnics and then the International Association of Applied Psychology The IAAP is considered the oldest international psychology association Today at least 65 international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology In response to male predominance in the field female psychologists in the US formed the National Council of Women Psychologists in 1941 This organization became the International Council of Women Psychologists after World War II and the International Council of Psychologists in 1959 Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of nonEuropean racial groups in the profession The International Union of Psychological Science IUPsyS is the world federation of national psychological societies The IUPsyS was founded in 1951 under the auspices of the United Nations Educational Cultural and Scientific Organization UNESCO Psychology departments have since proliferated around the world based primarily on the EuroAmerican model Since 1966 the Union has published the International Journal of Psychology IAAP and IUPsyS agreed in 1976 each to hold a congress every four years on a staggered basis IUPsyS recognizes 66 national psychology associations and at least 15 others exist The American Psychological Association is the oldest and largest Its membership has increased from 5000 in 1945 to 100000 in the present day The APA includes 54 divisions which since 1960 have steadily proliferated to include more specialties Some of these divisions such as the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues and the American PsychologyLaw Society began as autonomous groups The Interamerican Psychological Society founded in 1951 aspires to promote psychology across the Western Hemisphere It holds the Interamerican Congress of Psychology and had 1000 members in year 2000 The European Federation of Professional Psychology Associations founded in 1981 represents 30 national associations with a total of 100000 individual members At least 30 other international organizations represent psychologists in different regions In some places governments legally regulate who can provide psychological services or represent themselves as a psychologist The APA defines a psychologist as someone with a doctoral degree in psychology Boundaries Early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed popularity including the interest of scholars such as William James Some people considered parapsychology to be part of psychology Parapsychology hypnotism and psychism were major topics at the early International Congresses But students of these fields were eventually ostracized and more or less banished from the Congress in 19001905 Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University in Japan with publications such as Clairvoyance and Thoughtography by Tomokichi Fukurai but it was mostly shunned by 1913 As a discipline psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a soft science Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhns 1962 critique implied psychology overall was in a preparadigm state lacking agreement on the type of overarching theory found in mature hard sciences such as chemistry and physics Because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as selfreports in surveys and questionnaires critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science Skeptics have suggested that personality thinking and emotion cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective selfreports which may be problematic Experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities Divisions still exist within the field with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population Critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a cult of empiricism which limits the scope of research because investigators restrict themselves to methods derived from the physical sciences 367 Feminist critiques have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of historically mostly male researchers Jean Grimshaw for example argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a patriarchal agenda through its efforts to control behavior 120 Major schools of thought Biological Psychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling and therefore an important area of study Behaviorial neuroscience also known as biological psychology involves the application of biological principles to the study of physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other animals The allied field of comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of nonhuman animals A leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are localized in the brain From Phineas Gage to HM and Clive Wearing individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this area Modern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the 1870s when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function Soon after Carl Wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech 202 The contemporary field of behavioral neuroscience focuses on the physical basis of behavior Behaviorial neuroscientists use animal models often relying on rats to study the neural genetic and cellular mechanisms that underlie behaviors involved in learning memory and fear responses Cognitive neuroscientists by using neural imaging tools investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans Neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine how an individuals behavior and cognition are related to the brain The biopsychosocial model is a crossdisciplinary holistic model that concerns the ways in which interrelationships of biological psychological and socioenvironmental factors affect health and behavior Evolutionary psychology approaches thought and behavior from a modern evolutionary perspective This perspective suggests that psychological adaptations evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments Evolutionary psychologists attempt to find out how human psychological traits are evolved adaptations the results of natural selection or sexual selection over the course of human evolution The history of the biological foundations of psychology includes evidence of racism The idea of white supremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by Europeans Carl von Linnaeuss fourfold classification of humans classifies Europeans as intelligent and severe Americans as contented and free Asians as ritualistic and Africans as lazy and capricious Race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as drapetomania and dysaesthesia aethiopicathe behavior of uncooperative African slaves After the creation of experimental psychology ethnical psychology emerged as a subdiscipline based on the assumption that studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans Behaviorist A tenet of behavioral research is that a large part of both human and loweranimal behavior is learned A principle associated with behavioral research is that the mechanisms involved in learning apply to humans and nonhuman animals Behavioral researchers have developed a treatment known as behavior modification which is used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with desirable ones Early behavioral researchers studied stimulusresponse pairings now known as classical conditioning They demonstrated that when a biologically potent stimulus eg food that elicits salivation is paired with a previously neutral stimulus eg a bell over several learning trials the neutral stimulus by itself can come to elicit the response the biologically potent stimulus elicits Ivan Pavlovknown best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previously linked with foodbecame a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans In the United States Edward Lee Thorndike initiated connectionist studies by trapping animals in puzzle boxes and rewarding them for escaping Thorndike wrote in 1911 There can be no moral warrant for studying mans nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts 2125 From 1910 to 1913 the American Psychological Association went through a sea change of opinion away from mentalism and towards behavioralism In 1913 John B Watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought 21827 Watsons famous Little Albert experiment in 1920 was at first thought to demonstrate that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill phobias aversions to other stimuli in an infant human although such a conclusion was likely an exaggeration Karl Lashley a close collaborator with Watson examined biological manifestations of learning in the brain Clark L Hull Edwin Guthrie and others did much to help behaviorism become a widely used paradigm A new method of instrumental or operant conditioning added the concepts of reinforcement and punishment to the model of behavior change Radical behaviorists avoided discussing the inner workings of the mind especially the unconscious mind which they considered impossible to assess scientifically Operant conditioning was first described by Miller and Kanorski and popularized in the US by BF Skinner who emerged as a leading intellectual of the behaviorist movement Noam Chomsky published an influential critique of radical behaviorism on the grounds that behaviorist principles could not adequately explain the complex mental process of language acquisition and language use The review which was scathing did much to reduce the status of behaviorism within psychology 2825 Martin Seligman and his colleagues discovered that they could condition in dogs a state of learned helplessness which was not predicted by the behaviorist approach to psychology Edward C Tolman advanced a hybrid cognitive behavioral model most notably with his 1948 publication discussing the cognitive maps used by rats to guess at the location of food at the end of a maze Skinners behaviorism did not die in part because it generated successful practical applications The Association for Behavior Analysis International was founded in 1974 and by 2003 had members from 42 countries The field has gained a foothold in Latin America and Japan Applied behavior analysis is the term used for the application of the principles of operant conditioning to change socially significant behavior it supersedes the term behavior modification Cognitive Cognitive psychology involves the study of mental processes including perception attention language comprehension and production memory and problem solving Researchers in the field of cognitive psychology are sometimes called cognitivists They rely on an information processing model of mental functioning Cognitivist research is informed by functionalism and experimental psychology Starting in the 1950s the experimental techniques developed by Wundt James Ebbinghaus and others reemerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivist and eventually constituted a part of the wider interdisciplinary cognitive science Some called this development the cognitive revolution because it rejected the antimentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis Albert Bandura helped along the transition in psychology from behaviorism to cognitive psychology Bandura and other social learning theorists advanced the idea of vicarious learning In other words they advanced the view that a child can learn by observing the immediate social environment and not necessarily from having been reinforced for enacting a behavior although they did not rule out the influence of reinforcement on learning a behavior Technological advances also renewed interest in mental states and mental representations English neuroscientist Charles Sherrington and Canadian psychologist Donald O Hebb used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena to the structure and function of the brain The rise of computer science cybernetics and artificial intelligence underlined the value of comparing information processing in humans and machines A popular and representative topic in this area is cognitive bias or irrational thought Psychologists and economists have classified and described a sizeable catalog of biases which recur frequently in human thought The availability heuristic for example is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something which happens to come readily to mind Elements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form cognitive behavioral therapy a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by American psychologist Albert Ellis and American psychiatrist Aaron T Beck On a broader level cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise involving cognitive psychologists cognitive neuroscientists linguists and researchers in artificial intelligence humancomputer interaction and computational neuroscience The discipline of cognitive science covers cognitive psychology as well as philosophy of mind computer science and neuroscience Computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest Social Social psychology is concerned with how behaviors thoughts feelings and the social environment influence human interactions Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individuals behavior eg conformity persuasion and the formation of beliefs attitudes and stereotypes about other people Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology for the purpose of understanding how people process remember or distort social information The study of group dynamics involves research on the nature of leadership organizational communication and related phenomena In recent years social psychologists have become interested in implicit measures mediational models and the interaction of person and social factors in accounting for behavior Some concepts that sociologists have applied to the study of psychiatric disorders concepts such as the social role sick role social class life events culture migration and total institution have influenced social psychologists Psychoanalytic Psychoanalysis is a collection of theories and therapeutic techniques intended to analyze the unconscious mind and its impact on everyday life These theories and techniques inform treatments for mental disorders Psychoanalysis originated in the 1890s most prominently with the work of Sigmund Freud Freuds psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods introspection and clinical observation It became very well known largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality repression and the unconscious 846 Freud pioneered the methods of free association and dream interpretation Psychoanalytic theory is not monolithic Other wellknown psychoanalytic thinkers who diverged from Freud include Alfred Adler Carl Jung Erik Erikson Melanie Klein DW Winnicott Karen Horney Erich Fromm John Bowlby Freuds daughter Anna Freud and Harry Stack Sullivan These individuals ensured that psychoanalysis would evolve into diverse schools of thought Among these schools are ego psychology object relations and interpersonal Lacanian and relational psychoanalysis Psychologists such as Hans Eysenck and philosophers including Karl Popper sharply criticized psychoanalysis Popper argued that psychoanalysis was not falsifiable no claim it made could be proven wrong and therefore inherently not a scientific discipline whereas Eysenck advanced the view that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental data By the end of the 20th century psychology departments in American universities mostly had marginalized Freudian theory dismissing it as a desiccated and dead historical artifact Researchers such as Antnio Damsio Oliver Sacks and Joseph LeDoux and individuals in the emerging field of neuropsychoanalysis have defended some of Freuds ideas on scientific grounds Existentialhumanistic Humanistic psychology which has been influenced by existentialism and phenomenology stresses free will and selfactualization It emerged in the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis The humanistic approach seeks to view the whole person not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions Humanistic psychology also focuses on personal growth selfidentity death aloneness and freedom It emphasizes subjective meaning the rejection of determinism and concern for positive growth rather than pathology Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow who formulated a hierarchy of human needs and Carl Rogers who created and developed clientcentered therapy Later positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific study Positive psychology is the study of factors which contribute to human happiness and wellbeing focusing more on people who are currently healthy In 2010 Clinical Psychological Review published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions such as gratitude journaling and the physical expression of gratitude It is however far from clear that positive psychology is effective in making people happier Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope but their effects are thought to be somewhat better than placebo effects The American Association for Humanistic Psychology formed in 1963 declared Humanistic psychology is primarily an orientation toward the whole of psychology rather than a distinct area or school It stands for respect for the worth of persons respect for differences of approach openmindedness as to acceptable methods and interest in exploration of new aspects of human behavior As a third force in contemporary psychology it is concerned with topics having little place in existing theories and systems eg love creativity self growth organism basic needgratification selfactualization higher values being becoming spontaneity play humor affection naturalness warmth egotranscendence objectivity autonomy responsibility meaning fairplay transcendental experience peak experience courage and related concepts Existential psychology emphasizes the need to understand a clients total orientation towards the world Existential psychology is opposed to reductionism behaviorism and other methods that objectify the individual In the 1950s and 1960s influenced by philosophers Sren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger psychoanalytically trained American psychologist Rollo May helped to develop existential psychology Existential psychotherapy which follows from existential psychology is a therapeutic approach that is based on the idea that a persons inner conflict arises from that individuals confrontation with the givens of existence Swiss psychoanalyst Ludwig Binswanger and American psychologist George Kelly may also be said to belong to the existential school Existential psychologists tend to differ from more humanistic psychologists in the formers relatively neutral view of human nature and relatively positive assessment of anxiety Existential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death free will and meaning suggesting that meaning can be shaped by myths and narratives meaning can be deepened by the acceptance of free will which is requisite to living an authentic life albeit often with anxiety with regard to death Austrian existential psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl drew evidence of meanings therapeutic power from reflections upon his own internment He created a variation of existential psychotherapy called logotherapy a type of existentialist analysis that focuses on a will to meaning in ones life as opposed to Adlers Nietzschean doctrine of will to power or Freuds will to pleasure Themes Personality Personality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior thought and emotion Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools of thought Each theory carries different assumptions about such features as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience According to Freud personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id ego and superego By contrast trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits Trait theorists have often employed statistical datareduction methods such as factor analysis Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely Hans Eysencks early biologically based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality extraversionintroversion neuroticismstability and psychoticismnormality Raymond Cattell empirically derived a theory of 16 personality factors at the primaryfactor level and up to eight broader secondstratum factors Since the 1980s the Big Five openness to experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism emerged as an important trait theory of personality Dimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support and a version of dimensional assessment has been included in the DSMV However despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the Big Five personality dimensions it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan An early example of personality assessment was the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet constructed during World War I The popular although psychometrically inadequate MyersBriggs Type Indicator was developed to assess individuals personality types according to the personality theories of Carl Jung The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory MMPI despite its name is more a dimensional measure of psychopathology than a personality measure California Psychological Inventory contains 20 personality scales eg independence tolerance The International Personality Item Pool which is in the public domain has become a source of scales that can be used personality assessment Unconscious mind Study of the unconscious mind a part of the psyche outside the individuals awareness but that is believed to influence conscious thought and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States CS Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 that research subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference Freud popularized the concept of the unconscious mind particularly when he referred to an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into ones speech a Freudian slip or to his efforts to interpret dreams His 1901 book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogs hundreds of everyday events that Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the direct scrutiny of the subject The concept of unconscious processes has remained important in psychology Cognitive psychologists have used a filter model of attention According to the model much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness and only certain stimuli limited by their nature and number make their way through the filter Much research has shown that subconscious priming of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior Because of the unreliability of selfreporting a major hurdle in this type of research involves demonstrating that a subjects conscious mind has not perceived a target stimulus For this reason some psychologists prefer to distinguish between implicit and explicit memory In another approach one can also describe a subliminal stimulus as meeting an objective but not a subjective threshold The automaticity model of John Bargh and others involves the ideas of automaticity and unconscious processing in our understanding of social behavior although there has been dispute with regard to replication Some experimental data suggest that the brain begins to consider taking actions before the mind becomes aware of them The influence of unconscious forces on peoples choices bears on the philosophical question of free will John Bargh Daniel Wegner and Ellen Langer describe free will as an illusion Motivation Some psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a particular time It also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a behavior Psychologists such as William James initially used the term motivation to refer to intention in a sense similar to the concept of will in European philosophy With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation According to drive theory the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence Psychoanalysis like biology regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system Psychoanalysts believed that these forces especially the sexual instincts could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle roughly corresponding to id and ego Later in Beyond the Pleasure Principle Freud introduced the concept of the death drive a compulsion towards aggression destruction and psychic repetition of traumatic events Meanwhile behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models pleasurepain rewardpunishment and wellestablished principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model Hunger thirst fear sexual desire and thermoregulation constitute fundamental motivations in animals Humans seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivationsthough theoretically these could be explained as resulting from desires for belonging positive selfimage selfconsistency truth love and control Motivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways Researchers have found that eating for example depends not only on the organisms fundamental need for homeostasisan important factor causing the experience of hungerbut also on circadian rhythms food availability food palatability and cost Abstract motivations are also malleable as evidenced by such phenomena as goal contagion the adoption of goals sometimes unconsciously based on inferences about the goals of others Vohs and Baumeister suggest that contrary to the needdesirefulfillment cycle of animal instincts human motivations sometimes obey a getting begets wanting rule the more you get a reward such as selfesteem love drugs or money the more you want it They suggest that this principle can even apply to food drink sex and sleep Development psychology Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why the thought processes emotions and behaviors of humans change over the course of their lives Some credit Charles Darwin with conducting the first systematic study within the rubric of developmental psychology having published in 1877 a short paper detailing the development of innate forms of communication based on his observations of his infant son The main origins of the discipline however are found in the work of Jean Piaget Like Piaget developmental psychologists originally focused primarily on the development of cognition from infancy to adolescence Later developmental psychology extended itself to the study cognition over the life span In addition to studying cognition developmental psychologists have also come to focus on affective behavioral moral social and neural development Developmental psychologists who study children use a number of research methods For example they make observations of children in natural settings such as preschools and engage them in experimental tasks Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful Developmental researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants In addition to studying children developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span including old age These psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research Genes and environment All researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment to varying degrees These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals and families An example of this confounding can be shown in the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring A theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an offspring by virtue of their having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother is at risk for developing depression On the other hand a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in an offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother Genes and environment in these simple transmission models are completely confounded A depressed mother may both carry genes that contribute to depression in her offspring and also create a rearing environment that increases the risk of depression in her child Behavioral genetics researchers have employed methodologies that help to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior Traditionally the research has involved twin studies and adoption studies two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially unconfounded More recently genefocused research has contributed to understanding genetic contributions to the development of psychological traits The availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genomewide association studies One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in Huntingtons once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology as well as complex medical diseases are highly polygenic where a large number on the order of hundreds to thousands of genetic variants each of small effect contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder Active research continues to work toward understanding the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction Applications Psychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior Psychological testing Psychological testing has ancient origins dating as far back as 2200 BC in the examinations for the Chinese civil service Written exams began during the Han dynasty 202 BC AD 220 By 1370 the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics The system was ended in 1906 412 In Europe mental assessment took a different approach with theories of physiognomyjudgment of character based on the facedescribed by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment and added the doctrine of phrenology a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy 423 When experimental psychology came to Britain Francis Galton was a leading practitioner By virtue of his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation he is considered an inventor of modern mental testing also known as psychometrics 445 James McKeen Cattell a student of Wundt and Galton brought the idea of psychological testing to the United States and in fact coined the term mental test 456 In 1901 Cattells student Clark Wissler published discouraging results suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict academic performance 456 In response to 1904 orders from the Minister of Public Instruction One example of an observational study was run by Arthur Bandura This observational study focused on children who were exposed to an adult exhibiting aggressive behaviors and their reaction to toys versus other children who were not exposed to these stimuli The result shows that children who had seen the adult acting aggressively towards a toy in turn were aggressive towards their own toy when put in a situation that frustrated them psychologists Alfred Binet and Thodore Simon developed and elaborated a new test of intelligence in 19051911 They used a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty Binet and Simon introduced the concept of mental age and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as idiots Henry H Goddard put the BinetSimon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as imbecile and feebleminded In 1916 after Binets death Stanford professor Lewis M Terman modified the BinetSimon scale renamed the StanfordBinet scale and introduced the intelligence quotient as a score report 5056 Based on his test findings and reflecting the racism common to that era Terman concluded that intellectual disability represents the level of intelligence which is very very common among SpanishIndians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes Their dullness seems to be racial Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests which was developed by psychologist Robert Yerkes in 1917 and then used in World War 1 by industrial and organizational psychologists for largescale employee testing and selection of military personnel Mental testing also became popular in the US where it was applied to schoolchildren The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s In 1926 the College Entrance Examination Board created the Scholastic Aptitude Test to standardize college admissions 61 The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions including the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor These practices were criticized by Black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison Davis Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded now referred to as intellectual disability In the United States tens of thousands of men and women were sterilized Setting a precedent that has never been overturned the US Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1927 case Buck v Bell Today mental testing is a routine phenomenon for people of all ages in Western societies 2 Modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure consistency of results output of an interpretable score statistical norms describing population outcomes and ideally effective prediction of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations 46 Psychological testing is regularly used in forensic contexts to aid legal judgments and decisions Developments in psychometrics include work on test and scale reliability and validity Developments in itemresponse theory structural equation modeling and bifactor analysis have helped in strengthening test and scale construction Mental health care The provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the US Sometimes however members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in practices that resemble that of clinical psychologists Clinical psychologists typically include people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology In Canada some of the members of the abovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology In Canada and the US practitioners get bachelors degrees and doctorates doctoral students in clinical psychology usually spend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internship In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries psychologists do not get bachelors and doctoral degrees instead they take a threeyear professional course following high school Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding preventing and relieving psychological distress dysfunction andor mental illness Clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective wellbeing and personal growth Central to the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research teaching consultation forensic testimony and program development and administration Credit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896 Another modern psychotherapist was Morton Prince an early advocate for the establishment of psychology as a clinical and academic discipline In the first part of the twentieth century most mental health care in the United States was performed by psychiatrists who are medical doctors Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing which promised to improve the diagnosis of mental problems For their part some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally ill Psychotherapy as conducted by psychiatrists blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology and this trend continued with the rise of community mental health facilities Some in the clinical psychology community adopted behavioral therapy a thoroughly nonpsychodynamic model that used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatments effectiveness In the 1970s cognitivebehavior therapy emerged with the work of Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck Although there are similarities between behavior therapy and cognitivebehavior therapy cognitivebehavior therapy required the application of cognitive constructs Since the 1970s the popularity of cognitivebehavior therapy among clinical psychologists increased A key practice in behavioral and cognitivebehavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear based on the premise that their responses fear panic anxiety can be deconditioned Mental health care today involves psychologists and social workers in increasing numbers In 1977 National Institute of Mental Health director Bertram Brown described this shift as a source of intense competition and role confusion Graduate programs issuing doctorates in clinical psychology emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s The PhD degree is intended to train practitioners who could also conduct scientific research The PsyD degree is more exclusively designed to train practitioners Some clinical psychologists focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury This subspecialty is known as clinical neuropsychology In many countries clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession The emerging field of disaster psychology see crisis intervention involves professionals who respond to largescale traumatic events The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client usually an individual couple family or small group Typically these approaches encourage new ways of thinking feeling or behaving Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic cognitive behavioral existentialhumanistic and systems or family therapy There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture gender spirituality and sexual orientation With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance Because of this more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation Diagnosis in clinical psychology usually follows the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM The study of mental illnesses is called abnormal psychology Education Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings the effectiveness of educational interventions the psychology of teaching and the social psychology of schools as organizations Educational psychologists can be found in preschools schools of all levels including post secondary institutions community organizations and learning centers Government or private research firms and independent or private consultant The work of developmental psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America Australia and New Zealand School psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities to foster the intellectual growth of gifted students to facilitate prosocial behaviors in adolescents and otherwise to promote safe supportive and effective learning environments School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment intervention prevention and consultation and many have extensive training in research Work Industrial and organizational IO psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals worklives In the fields beginnings industrialists brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiency The field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology later industrial psychology employment psychology or psychotechnology An influential early study examined workers at Western Electrics Hawthorne plant in Cicero Illinois from 1924 to 1932 Western Electric experimented on factory workers to assess their responses to changes in illumination breaks food and wages The researchers came to focus on workers responses to observation itself and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that peoples behavior can change when they think they are being observed Although the Hawthorne research can be found in psychology textbooks the research and its findings were weak at best The name industrial and organizational psychology emerged in the 1960s In 1973 it became enshrined in the name of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology Division 14 of the American Psychological Association One goal of the discipline is to optimize human potential in the workplace Personnel psychology is a subfield of IO psychology Personnel psychologists apply the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers Another subfield organizational psychology examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation job satisfaction and productivity Most IO psychologists work outside of academia for private and public organizations and as consultants A psychology consultant working in business today might expect to provide executives with information and ideas about their industry their target markets and the organization of their company Organizational behavior OB is an allied field involved in the study of human behavior within organizations One way to differentiate IO psychology from OB is that IO psychologists train in university psychology departments and OB specialists in business schools Military and intelligence One role for psychologists in the military has been to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel In the US this function began during World War I when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia The school provided psychological training for military staff Today US Army psychologists perform psychological screening clinical psychotherapy suicide prevention and treatment for posttraumatic stress as well as provide preventionrelated services for example smoking cessation The United States Armys Mental Health Advisory Teams implement psychological interventions to help combat troops experiencing mental problems Psychologists may also work on a diverse set of campaigns known broadly as psychological warfare Psychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians This socalled black propaganda is designed to seem as if it originates from a source other than the Army The CIAs MKULTRA program involved more individualized efforts at mind control involving techniques such as hypnosis torture and covert involuntary administration of LSD The US military used the name Psychological Operations PSYOP until 2010 when these activities were reclassified as Military Information Support Operations MISO part of Information Operations IO Psychologists have sometimes been involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects staining the records of the psychologists involved Health wellbeing and social change Social change An example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of Kenneth and Mamie Phipps Clark These two African American psychologists studied segregations adverse psychological impact on Black children Their research findings played a role in the desegregation case Brown v Board of Education 1954 The impact of psychology on social change includes the disciplines broad influence on teaching and learning Research has shown that compared to the whole word or whole language approach the phonics approach to reading instruction is more efficacious Medical applications Medical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles One aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance Psychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies Psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole populations of people Worker health safety and wellbeing Psychologists work with organizations to apply findings from psychological research to improve the health and wellbeing of employees Some work as external consultants hired by organizations to solve specific problems whereas others are fulltime employees of the organization Applications include conducting surveys to identify issues and designing interventions to make work healthier Some of the specific health areas include Accidents and injuries A major contribution is the concept of safety climate which is employee shared perceptions of the behaviors that are encouraged eg wearing safety gear and discouraged not following safety rules at work Organizations with strong safety climates have fewer work accidents and injuries Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease has been related to lack of job control Mental health Exposure to occupational stress is associated with mental health disorder Musculoskeletal disorder These are injuries in bones nerves and tendons due to overexertion and repetitive strain They have been linked to job satisfaction and workplace stress Physical health symptoms Occupational stress has been linked to physical symptoms such as digestive distress and headache Workplace violence Violence prevention climate is related to being physically assaulted and psychologically mistreated at work Interventions that improve climates are a way to address accidents and violence Interventions that reduce stress at work or provide employees with tools to better manage it can help in areas where stress is an important component Industrial psychology became interested in worker fatigue during World War I when government ministers in Britain were concerned about the impact of fatigue on workers in munitions factories but not other types of factories In the U K some interest in worker wellbeing emerged with the efforts of Charles Samuel Myers and his National Institute of Industrial Psychology NIIP during the interWar years In the U S during the midtwentieth century industrial psychologist Arthur Kornhauser pioneered the study of occupational mental health linking industrial working conditions to mental health as well as the spillover of an unsatisfying job into a workers personal life Zickar accumulated evidence to show that no other industrial psychologist of his era was as devoted to advocating management and labor practices that would improve the lives of working people Occupational health psychology As interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century the field of occupational health psychology OHP emerged OHP is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinary OHP is concerned with the health and safety of workers OHP addresses topic areas such as the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health mistreatment of workers eg bullying and violence workfamily balance the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health the influence of psychosocial factors on safety and accidents and interventions designed to improveprotect worker health OHP grew out of health psychology industrial and organizational psychology and occupational medicine OHP has also been informed by disciplines outside psychology including industrial engineering sociology and economics Research methods Quantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings such research can only assess a limited range of shortterm phenomena Some psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled but more ecologically valid field experiments as well Other research psychologists rely on statistical methods to glean knowledge from population data The statistical methods research psychologists employ include the Pearson productmoment correlation coefficient the analysis of variance multiple linear regression logistic regression structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling The measurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs Although this type of psychological research is much less abundant than quantitative research some psychologists conduct qualitative research This type of research can involve interviews questionnaires and firsthand observation While hypothesis testing is rare virtually impossible in qualitative research qualitative studies can be helpful in theory and hypothesis generation interpreting seemingly contradictory quantitative findings and understanding why some interventions fail and others succeed Controlled experiments A true experiment with random assignment of research participants sometimes called subjects to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships When there are large numbers of research participants the random assignment also called random allocation of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will on average be similar on most characteristics including characteristics that went unmeasured In an experiment the researcher alters one or more variables of influence called independent variables and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest called dependent variables Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment A quasiexperiment is a situation in which different conditions are being studied but random assignment to the different conditions is not possible Investigators must work with preexisting groups of people Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the studys validity For example in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes and perhaps statistically adjust for any initial differences in reading level Experimental researchers typically use a statistical hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment then assessing how well the data collected are consistent with the predictions These predictions are likely to originate from one or more abstract scientific hypotheses about how the phenomenon under study actually works Other types of studies Surveys are used in psychology for the purpose of measuring attitudes and traits monitoring changes in mood and checking the validity of experimental manipulations checking research participants perception of the condition they were assigned to Psychologists have commonly used paperandpencil surveys However surveys are also conducted over the phone or through email Webbased surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects Observational studies are commonly conducted in psychology In crosssectional observational studies psychologists collect data at a single point in time The goal of many crosssectional studies is the assess the extent factors are correlated with each other By contrast in longitudinal studies psychologists collect data on the same sample at two or more points in time Sometimes the purpose of longitudinal research is to study trends across time such as the stability of traits or agerelated changes in behavior Because some studies involve endpoints that psychologists cannot ethically study from an experimental standpoint such as identifying the causes of depression they conduct longitudinal studies a large group of depressionfree people periodically assessing what is happening in the individuals lives In this way psychologists have an opportunity to test causal hypotheses regarding conditions that commonly arise in peoples lives that put them at risk for depression Problems that affect longitudinal studies include selective attrition the type of problem in which bias is introduced when a certain type of research participant disproportionately leaves a study One example of an observational study was run by Arthur Bandura This observational study focused on children who were exposed to an adult exhibiting aggressive behaviors and their reaction to toys versus other children who were not exposed to these stimuli The result shows that children who had seen the adult acting aggressively towards a toy in turn were aggressive towards their own toy when put in a situation that frustrated them Exploratory data analysis includes a variety of practices that researchers use to reduce a great many variables to a small number overarching factors In Peirces three modes of inference exploratory data analysis corresponds to abduction Metaanalysis is the technique research psychologists use to integrate results from many studies of the same variables and arriving at a grand average of the findings Direct brain observationmanipulation A classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the electroencephalogram EEG a technique using amplified electrodes on a persons scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain Hans Berger the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull quickly found that brains exhibit signature brain waves electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave observed during nonREM sleep Newer functional neuroimaging techniques include functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography both of which track the flow of blood through the brain These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective selfreporting It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originateor even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality However neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain Some of these draw on a systemic neural network model rather than a localized function model Interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and drugs also provide information about brainmind interactions Psychopharmacology is the study of druginduced mental effects Computer simulation Computational modeling is a tool used in mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior This method has several advantages Since modern computers process information quickly simulations can be run in a short time allowing for high statistical power Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that could not be directly observed in a human Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain Another method is symbolic modeling which represents many mental objects using variables and rules Other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling Animal studies Animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology including perception emotion learning memory and thought to name a few In the 1890s Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning Nonhuman primates cats dogs pigeons and rats and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments Ideally controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings In contrast human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely and depend upon so many factors that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects There are pitfalls however in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models Comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of nonhuman animals especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history adaptive significance and development of behavior Research in this area explores the behavior of many species from insects to primates It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethology Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial for example the Sociobiology of EO Wilson Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior eg in cognitive neuroscience Qualitative research Qualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts feelings and behaviors of individuals Qualitative research involving firsthand observation can help describe events as they occur with the goal of capturing the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations are made Qualitative psychological research methods include interviews firsthand observation and participant observation Creswell 2003 identified five main possibilities for qualitative research including narrative phenomenology ethnography case study and grounded theory Qualitative researchers sometimes aim to enrich our understanding of symbols subjective experiences or social structures Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research as in Erich Fromms application of psychological and sociological theories in his book Escape from Freedom to understanding why many ordinary Germans supported Hitler Just as Jane Goodall studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social professional and family life Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed and other times the participants do not know they are being observed Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out Program evaluation Program evaluation involves the systematic collection analysis and application of information to answer questions about projects policies and programs particularly about their effectiveness In both the public and private sectors stakeholders often want to know the extent which the programs they are funding implementing voting for receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effects While program evaluation first focuses on effectiveness important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant how the program could be improved whether the program is worthwhile whether there are better alternatives if there are unintended outcomes and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful Contemporary issues Metascience Metascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itself The field of metascience has revealed problems in psychological research Some psychological research has suffered from bias problematic reproducibility and misuse of statistics These findings have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community Confirmation bias In 1959 statistician Theodore Sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that 97 of them supported their initial hypotheses implying possible publication bias Similarly Fanelli 2010 found that 915 of psychiatrypsychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for and concluded that the odds of this happening a positive result was around five times higher than in fields such as space science or geosciences Fanelli argued that this is because researchers in softer sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases Replication A replication crisis in psychology has emerged Many notable findings in the field have not been replicated Some researchers were even accused of publishing fraudulent results Systematic efforts including efforts by the Reproducibility Project of the Center for Open Science to assess the extent of the problem found that as many as twothirds of highly publicized findings in psychology failed to be replicated Reproducibility has generally been stronger in cognitive psychology in studies and journals than social psychology and subfields of differential psychology Other subfields of psychology have also been implicated in the replication crisis including clinical psychology developmental psychology and a field closely related to psychology educational research Focus on the replication crisis has led to other renewed efforts in the discipline to retest important findings In response to concerns about publication bias and data dredging conducting a large number of statistical tests on a great many variables but restricting reporting to the results that were statistically significant 295 psychology and medical journals have adopted resultblind peer review where studies are accepted not on the basis of their findings and after the studies are completed but before the studies are conducted and upon the basis of the methodological rigor of their experimental designs and the theoretical justifications for their proposed statistical analysis before data collection or analysis is conducted In addition largescale collaborations among researchers working in multiple labs in different countries have taken place The collaborators regularly make their data openly available for different researchers to assess Allen and Mehler estimated that 61 per cent of resultblind studies have yielded null results in contrast to an estimated 5 to 20 per cent in traditional research Misuse of statistics Some critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplaced Psychologist and statistician Jacob Cohen wrote in 1994 that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts Some psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics rather than sole reliance on pvalues WEIRD bias In 2008 Arnett pointed out that most articles in American Psychological Association journals were about US populations when US citizens are only 5 of the worlds population He complained that psychologists had no basis for assuming psychological processes to be universal and generalizing research findings to the rest of the global population In 2010 Henrich Heine and Norenzayan reported a bias in conducting psychology studies with participants from WEIRD Western Educated Industrialized Rich and Democratic societies Henrich et al found that 96 of psychological samples come from countries with only 12 of the worlds population p 63 The article gave examples of results that differ significantly between people from WEIRD and tribal cultures including the MllerLyer illusion Arnett 2008 Altmaier and Hall 2008 and MorganConsoli et al 2018 view the Western bias in research and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in WEIRD regions in their research clinical work and consultation with populations around the world In 2018 Rad Martingano and Ginges showed that nearly a decade after Henrich et als paper over 80 of the samples used in studies published in the journal Psychological Science employed WEIRD samples Moreover their analysis showed that several studies did not fully disclose the origin of their samples the authors offered a set of recommendations to editors and reviewers to reduce WEIRD bias STRANGE bias Similar to the WEIRD bias starting in 2020 researchers of nonhuman behavior have started to emphasize the need to document the possibility of the STRANGE Social background Trappability and selfselection Rearing history Acclimation and habituation Natural changes in responsiveness Genetic makeup and Experience bias in study conclusions Unscientific mental health training Some observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its applicationin particular the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices Critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence Practices such as facilitated communication for infantile autism memoryrecovery techniques including body work and other therapies such as rebirthing and reparenting may be dubious or even dangerous despite their popularity These practices however are outside the mainstream practices taught in clinical psychology doctoral programs Ethics Ethical standards in the discipline have changed over time Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of established codes eg the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans and the Belmont Report The American Psychological Association has advanced a set of ethical principles and a code of conduct for the profession The most important contemporary standards include informed and voluntary consent After World War II the Nuremberg Code was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects Later most countries and scientific journals adopted the Declaration of Helsinki In the US the National Institutes of Health established the Institutional Review Board in 1966 and in 1974 adopted the National Research Act HR 7724 All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies A number of influential but ethically dubious studies led to the establishment of this rule such studies included the MITHarvard Fernald School radioisotope studies the Thalidomide tragedy the Willowbrook hepatitis study Stanley Milgrams studies of obedience to authority and the Stanford Prison Experiment Ethics with Humans The ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as Ethical Standards of Psychologists This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption and contains both aspirational principles and binding ethical standards The APAs Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct consists of five General Principles which are meant to guide psychologists to higher ethical practice where a particular standard does not apply Those principles are A Beneficence and Nonmaleficence meaning the psychologists must work to benefit those they work with and do no harm This includes awareness of indirect benefits and harms their work might have on others due to personal social political or other factors B Fidelity and Responsibility an awareness of public trust in the profession and adherence to ethical standards and clarification of roles to preserve that trust This includes managing conflicts of interest as well as committing some portion of a psychologists professional time to lowcost or pro bono work C Integrity upholding honesty and accuracy in all psychological practices including avoiding misrepresentations and fraud In situations where psychologists would use deception ie certain research psychologists must consider the necessity benefits and harms and mitigate any harms where possible D Justice an understanding that psychology must be for everyones benefit and that psychologists take special care to avoid unjust practices as a result of biases or limitations of expertise E Respect for Peoples Rights and Dignity the preservation of peoples rights when working with psychologists including confidentially privacy and autonomy Psychologists should consider a multitude of factors including a need for special safeguards for protected populations eg minors incarcerated individuals and awareness of differences based on numerous factors including culture race age gender and socioeconomic status In 1989 the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between aspirational ethical standards and enforceable ones The APA code was further revised in 2010 to prevent the use of the code to justify violating human rights which was in response to the participation of APA members in interrogations under the administration of United States President George W Bush Members of the public have a fiveyear window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee members of the APA have a threeyear window The Canadian Psychological Association used the APA code until 1986 when it developed its own code drawing from four similar principles 1 Respect for the Dignity of Persons and Peoples 2 Responsible Caring 3 Integrity in Relationships 4 Responsibility to Society The European Federation of Psychologists Associations have adopted a model code using the principles of the Canadian Code while also drawing from the APA code Universities have ethics committees dedicated to protecting the rights eg voluntary nature of participation in the research privacy and wellbeing eg minimizing distress of research participants University ethics committees evaluate proposed research to ensure that researchers protect the rights and wellbeing of participants an investigators research project cannot be conducted unless approved by such an ethics committee The field of psychology also identifies certain categories of people that require additional or special protection due to particular vulnerabilities unequal power dynamics or diminished capacity for informed consent This list often includes but is not limited to children incarcerated individuals pregnant women human fetuses and neonates institutionalized persons those with physical or mental disabilities and the educationally or economically disadvantaged Some of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence to maintain confidentiality with the patients and to avoid sexual relations with them Another important principle is informed consent the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct and breaches in confidentiality or privacy Psychology ethics apply to all types of human contact in a psychologists professional capacity including therapy assessment teaching training work with research subjects testimony in courts and before government bodies consulting and statements to the public or media pertaining to matters of psychology Ethics with other animals Research on other animals is governed by university ethics committees Research on nonhuman animals cannot proceed without permission of the ethics committee of the researchers home institution Ethical guidelines state that using nonhuman animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm physical or psychological done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research Psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans Comparative psychologist Harry Harlow drew moral condemnation for isolation experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the University of WisconsinMadison in the 1970s The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression Harlow also devised what he called a rape rack to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture In 1974 American literary critic Wayne C Booth wrote that Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade invariably proving what we all knew in advancethat social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work Animal research is influential in psychology while still being debated among academics The testing of animals for research has led to medical breakthroughs in human medicine Many psychologists argue animal experimentation is essential for human advancement but must be regulated by the government to ensure ethicality References Sources Further reading External links Quotations related to

    title: "Special relativity",
    originalContent:
      "In physics the special theory of relativity or special relativity for short is a scientific theory of the relationship between space and time In Albert Einsteins 1905 paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies the theory is presented as being based on just two postulates The laws of physics are invariant identical in all inertial frames of reference that is frames of reference with no acceleration This is known as the principle of relativity The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of the motion of light source or observer This is known as the principle of light constancy or the principle of light speed invariance The first postulate was first formulated by Galileo Galilei see Galilean invariance Origins and significance Special relativity was described by Albert Einstein in a paper published on 26 September 1905 titled On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies Maxwells equations of electromagnetism appeared to be incompatible with Newtonian mechanics and the MichelsonMorley experiment failed to detect the Earths motion against the hypothesized luminiferous aether These led to the development of the Lorentz transformations by Hendrik Lorentz which adjust distances and times for moving objects Special relativity corrects the hitherto laws of mechanics to handle situations involving all motions and especially those at a speed close to that of light known as relativistic velocities Today special relativity is proven to be the most accurate model of motion at any speed when gravitational and quantum effects are negligible Even so the Newtonian model is still valid as a simple and accurate approximation at low velocities relative to the speed of light for example everyday motions on Earth Special relativity has a wide range of consequences that have been experimentally verified These include the relativity of simultaneity length contraction time dilation the relativistic velocity addition formula the relativistic Doppler effect relativistic mass a universal speed limit massenergy equivalence the speed of causality and the Thomas precession It has for example replaced the conventional notion of an absolute universal time with the notion of a time that is dependent on reference frame and spatial position Rather than an invariant time interval between two events there is an invariant spacetime interval Combined with other laws of physics the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy as expressed in the massenergy equivalence formula E m c 2 displaystyle Emc2 where c displaystyle c is the speed of light in vacuum It also explains how the phenomena of electricity and magnetism are related A defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the Galilean transformations of Newtonian mechanics with the Lorentz transformations Time and space cannot be defined separately from each other as was previously thought to be the case Rather space and time are interwoven into a single continuum known as spacetime Events that occur at the same time for one observer can occur at different times for another Until several years later when Einstein developed general relativity which introduced a curved spacetime to incorporate gravity the phrase special relativity was not used A translation sometimes used is restricted relativity special really means special case Some of the work of Albert Einstein in special relativity is built on the earlier work by Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincar The theory became essentially complete in 1907 with Hermann Minkowskis papers on spacetime The theory is special in that it only applies in the special case where the spacetime is flat that is where the curvature of spacetime a consequence of the energymomentum tensor and representing gravity is negligible To correctly accommodate gravity Einstein formulated general relativity in 1915 Special relativity contrary to some historical descriptions does accommodate accelerations as well as accelerating frames of reference Just as Galilean relativity is now accepted to be an approximation of special relativity that is valid for low speeds special relativity is considered an approximation of general relativity that is valid for weak gravitational fields that is at a sufficiently small scale eg when tidal forces are negligible and in conditions of free fall But general relativity incorporates nonEuclidean geometry to represent gravitational effects as the geometric curvature of spacetime Special relativity is restricted to the flat spacetime known as Minkowski space As long as the universe can be modeled as a pseudoRiemannian manifold a Lorentzinvariant frame that abides by special relativity can be defined for a sufficiently small neighborhood of each point in this curved spacetime Galileo Galilei had already postulated that there is no absolute and welldefined state of rest no privileged reference frames a principle now called Galileos principle of relativity Einstein extended this principle so that it accounted for the constant speed of light a phenomenon that had been observed in the MichelsonMorley experiment He also postulated that it holds for all the laws of physics including both the laws of mechanics and of electrodynamics Traditional two postulates approach to special relativity Einstein discerned two fundamental propositions that seemed to be the most assured regardless of the exact validity of the then known laws of either mechanics or electrodynamics These propositions were the constancy of the speed of light in vacuum and the independence of physical laws especially the constancy of the speed of light from the choice of inertial system In his initial presentation of special relativity in 1905 he expressed these postulates as The principle of relativity the laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not affected whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems in uniform translatory motion relative to each other The principle of invariant light speed light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity speed c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body from the preface That is light in vacuum propagates with the speed c a fixed constant independent of direction in at least one system of inertial coordinates the stationary system regardless of the state of motion of the light source The constancy of the speed of light was motivated by Maxwells theory of electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous ether There is conflicting evidence on the extent to which Einstein was influenced by the null result of the MichelsonMorley experiment In any case the null result of the MichelsonMorley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance The derivation of special relativity depends not only on these two explicit postulates but also on several tacit assumptions made in almost all theories of physics including the isotropy and homogeneity of space and the independence of measuring rods and clocks from their past history Following Einsteins original presentation of special relativity in 1905 many different sets of postulates have been proposed in various alternative derivations But the most common set of postulates remains those employed by Einstein in his original paper A more mathematical statement of the principle of relativity made later by Einstein which introduces the concept of simplicity not mentioned above is Special principle of relativity If a system of coordinates K is chosen so that in relation to it physical laws hold good in their simplest form the same laws hold good in relation to any other system of coordinates K moving in uniform translation relatively to K Henri Poincar provided the mathematical framework for relativity theory by proving that Lorentz transformations are a subset of his Poincar group of symmetry transformations Einstein later derived these transformations from his axioms Many of Einsteins papers present derivations of the Lorentz transformation based upon these two principles Principle of relativity Reference frames and relative motion Reference frames play a crucial role in relativity theory The term reference frame as used here is an observational perspective in space that is not undergoing any change in motion acceleration from which a position can be measured along 3 spatial axes so at rest or constant velocity In addition a reference frame has the ability to determine measurements of the time of events using a clock any reference device with uniform periodicity An event is an occurrence that can be assigned a single unique moment and location in space relative to a reference frame it is a point in spacetime Since the speed of light is constant in relativity irrespective of the reference frame pulses of light can be used to unambiguously measure distances and refer back to the times that events occurred to the clock even though light takes time to reach the clock after the event has transpired For example the explosion of a firecracker may be considered to be an event We can completely specify an event by its four spacetime coordinates The time of occurrence and its 3dimensional spatial location define a reference point Lets call this reference frame S In relativity theory we often want to calculate the coordinates of an event from differing reference frames The equations that relate measurements made in different frames are called transformation equations Standard configuration To gain insight into how the spacetime coordinates measured by observers in different reference frames compare with each other it is useful to work with a simplified setup with frames in a standard configuration 107 With care this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached In Fig 21 two Galilean reference frames ie conventional 3space frames are displayed in relative motion Frame S belongs to a first observer O and frame S pronounced S prime or S dash belongs to a second observer O The x y z axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame S Frame S moves for simplicity in a single direction the xdirection of frame S with a constant velocity v as measured in frame S The origins of frames S and S are coincident when time t 0 for frame S and t 0 for frame S Since there is no absolute reference frame in relativity theory a concept of moving does not strictly exist as everything may be moving with respect to some other reference frame Instead any two frames that move at the same speed in the same direction are said to be comoving Therefore S and S are not comoving Lack of an absolute reference frame The principle of relativity which states that physical laws have the same form in each inertial reference frame dates back to Galileo and was incorporated into Newtonian physics But in the late 19th century the existence of electromagnetic waves led some physicists to suggest that the universe was filled with a substance they called aether which they postulated would act as the medium through which these waves or vibrations propagated in many respects similar to the way sound propagates through air The aether was thought to be an absolute reference frame against which all speeds could be measured and could be considered fixed and motionless relative to Earth or some other fixed reference point The aether was supposed to be sufficiently elastic to support electromagnetic waves while those waves could interact with matter yet offering no resistance to bodies passing through it its one property was that it allowed electromagnetic waves to propagate The results of various experiments including the MichelsonMorley experiment in 1887 subsequently verified with more accurate and innovative experiments led to the theory of special relativity by showing that the aether did not exist Einsteins solution was to discard the notion of an aether and the absolute state of rest In relativity any reference frame moving with uniform motion will observe the same laws of physics In particular the speed of light in vacuum is always measured to be c even when measured by multiple systems that are moving at different but constant velocities Relativity without the second postulate From the principle of relativity alone without assuming the constancy of the speed of light ie using the isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by the principle of special relativity it can be shown that the spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either Euclidean Galilean or Lorentzian In the Lorentzian case one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and a certain finite limiting speed Experiments suggest that this speed is the speed of light in vacuum Lorentz invariance as the essential core of special relativity Alternative approaches to special relativity Einstein consistently based the derivation of Lorentz invariance the essential core of special relativity on just the two basic principles of relativity and invariance of the speed of light He wrote The insight fundamental for the special theory of relativity is this The assumptions relativity and light speed invariance are compatible if relations of a new type Lorentz transformation are postulated for the conversion of coordinates and times of events The universal principle of the special theory of relativity is contained in the postulate The laws of physics are invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations for the transition from one inertial system to any other arbitrarily chosen inertial system This is a restricting principle for natural laws Thus many modern treatments of special relativity base it on the single postulate of universal Lorentz covariance or equivalently on the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime Rather than considering universal Lorentz covariance to be a derived principle this article considers it to be the fundamental postulate of special relativity The traditional twopostulate approach to special relativity is presented in innumerable college textbooks and popular presentations Textbooks starting with the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime include those by Taylor and Wheeler and by Callahan This is also the approach followed by the Wikipedia articles Spacetime and Minkowski diagram Lorentz transformation and its inverse Define an event to have spacetime coordinates t x y z in system S and t x y z in a reference frame moving at a velocity v on the xaxis with respect to that frame S Then the Lorentz transformation specifies that these coordinates are related in the following way t t v x c 2 x x v t y y z z displaystyle beginalignedtgamma tvxc2xgamma xvtyyzzendaligned where 1 1 v 2 c 2 displaystyle gamma frac 1sqrt 1v2c2 is the Lorentz factor and c is the speed of light in vacuum and the velocity v of S relative to S is parallel to the xaxis For simplicity the y and z coordinates are unaffected only the x and t coordinates are transformed These Lorentz transformations form a oneparameter group of linear mappings that parameter being called rapidity Solving the four transformation equations above for the unprimed coordinates yields the inverse Lorentz transformation t t v x c 2 x x v t y y z z displaystyle beginalignedtgamma tvxc2xgamma xvtyyzzendaligned This shows that the unprimed frame is moving with the velocity v as measured in the primed frame There is nothing special about the xaxis The transformation can apply to the y or zaxis or indeed in any direction parallel to the motion which are warped by the factor and perpendicular see the article Lorentz transformation for details A quantity that is invariant under Lorentz transformations is known as a Lorentz scalar Writing the Lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate differences where one event has coordinates x1 t1 and x1 t1 another event has coordinates x2 t2 and x2 t2 and the differences are defined as Eq 1 x x 2 x 1 t t 2 t 1 displaystyle Delta xx_2x_1 Delta tt_2t_1 Eq 2 x x 2 x 1 t t 2 t 1 displaystyle Delta xx_2x_1 Delta tt_2t_1 we get Eq 3 x x v t displaystyle

displaystyle dxgamma dxvdt d t d t v d x c 2 displaystyle dtgamma leftdtv dxc2right Graphical representation of the Lorentz transformation Spacetime diagrams Minkowski diagrams are an extremely useful aid to visualizing how coordinates transform between different reference frames Although it is not as easy to perform exact computations using them as directly invoking the Lorentz transformations their main power is their ability to provide an intuitive grasp of the results of a relativistic scenario To draw a spacetime diagram begin by considering two Galilean reference frames S and S in standard configuration as shown in Fig 21 155199 Fig 31a Draw the x displaystyle x and t displaystyle t axes of frame S The x displaystyle x axis is horizontal and the t displaystyle t actually c t displaystyle ct axis is vertical which is the opposite of the usual convention in kinematics The c t displaystyle ct axis is scaled by a factor of c displaystyle c so that both axes have common units of length In the diagram shown the gridlines are spaced one unit distance apart The 45 diagonal lines represent the worldlines of two photons passing through the origin at time t 0 displaystyle t0 The slope of these worldlines is 1 because the photons advance one unit in space per unit of time Two events A displaystyle textA and B displaystyle textB have been plotted on this graph so that their coordinates may be compared in the S and S frames Fig 31b Draw the x displaystyle x and c t displaystyle ct axes of frame S The c t displaystyle ct axis represents the worldline of the origin of the S coordinate system as measured in frame S In this figure v c 2 displaystyle vc2 Both the c t displaystyle ct and x displaystyle x axes are tilted from the unprimed axes by an angle tan 1 displaystyle alpha tan 1beta where v c displaystyle beta vc The primed and unprimed axes share a common origin because frames S and S had been set up in standard configuration so that t 0 displaystyle t0 when t 0 displaystyle t0 Fig 31c Units in the primed axes have a different scale from units in the unprimed axes From the Lorentz transformations we observe that x c t displaystyle xct coordinates of 0 1 displaystyle 01 in the primed coordinate system transform to displaystyle beta gamma gamma in the unprimed coordinate system Likewise x c t displaystyle xct coordinates of 1 0 displaystyle 10 in the primed coordinate system transform to displaystyle gamma beta gamma in the unprimed system Draw gridlines parallel with the c t displaystyle ct axis through points k k displaystyle kgamma kbeta gamma as measured in the unprimed frame where k displaystyle k is an integer Likewise draw gridlines parallel with the x displaystyle x axis through k k displaystyle kbeta gamma kgamma as measured in the unprimed frame Using the Pythagorean theorem we observe that the spacing between c t displaystyle ct units equals 1 2 1 2 textstyle sqrt 1beta 21beta 2 times the spacing between c t displaystyle ct units as measured in frame S This ratio is always greater than 1 and ultimately it approaches infinity as 1 displaystyle beta to 1 Fig 31d Since the speed of light is an invariant the worldlines of two photons passing through the origin at time t 0 displaystyle t0 still plot as 45 diagonal lines The primed coordinates of A displaystyle textA and B displaystyle textB are related to the unprimed coordinates through the Lorentz transformations and could be approximately measured from the graph assuming that it has been plotted accurately enough but the real merit of a Minkowski diagram is its granting us a geometric view of the scenario For example in this figure we observe that the two timelikeseparated events that had different xcoordinates in the unprimed frame are now at the same position in space While the unprimed frame is drawn with space and time axes that meet at right angles the primed frame is drawn with axes that meet at acute or obtuse angles This asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates map onto a Cartesian plane but the frames are actually equivalent Consequences derived from the Lorentz transformation The consequences of special relativity can be derived from the Lorentz transformation equations These transformations and hence special relativity lead to different physical predictions than those of Newtonian mechanics at all relative velocities and most pronounced when relative velocities become comparable to the speed of light The speed of light is so much larger than anything most humans encounter that some of the effects predicted by relativity are initially counterintuitive Invariant interval In Galilean relativity an objects length r displaystyle Delta r and the temporal separation between two events t displaystyle Delta t are independent invariants the values of which do not change when observed from different frames of reference In special relativity however the interweaving of spatial and temporal coordinates generates the concept of an invariant interval denoted as s 2 displaystyle Delta s2 s 2 def c 2 t 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 displaystyle Delta s2overset textdefc2Delta t2Delta x2Delta y2Delta z2 The interweaving of space and time revokes the implicitly assumed concepts of absolute simultaneity and synchronization across noncomoving frames The form of s 2 displaystyle Delta s2 being the difference of the squared time lapse and the squared spatial distance demonstrates a fundamental discrepancy between Euclidean and spacetime distances The invariance of this interval is a property of the general Lorentz transform also called the Poincar transformation making it an isometry of spacetime The general Lorentz transform extends the standard Lorentz transform which deals with translations without rotation that is Lorentz boosts in the xdirection with all other translations reflections and rotations between any Cartesian inertial frame 3334 In the analysis of simplified scenarios such as spacetime diagrams a reduceddimensionality form of the invariant interval is often employed s 2 c 2 t 2 x 2 displaystyle Delta s2c2Delta t2Delta x2 Demonstrating that the interval is

significance of s 2 displaystyle Delta s2 there are three cases to note 2539 s2 0 In this case the two events are separated by more time than space and they are hence said to be timelike separated This implies that x t c displaystyle vert Delta xDelta tvert c and given the Lorentz transformation x x v t displaystyle Delta xgamma Delta xv Delta t it is evident that there exists a v displaystyle v less than c displaystyle c for which x 0 displaystyle Delta x0 in particular v x t displaystyle vDelta xDelta t In other words given two events that are timelike separated it is possible to find a frame in which the two events happen at the same place In this frame the separation in time s c displaystyle Delta sc is called the proper time s2 0 In this case the two events are separated by more space than time and they are hence said to be spacelike separated This implies that x t c displaystyle vert Delta xDelta tvert c and given the Lorentz transformation t t v x c 2 displaystyle Delta

called the proper distance or proper length For values of v displaystyle v greater than and less than c 2 t x displaystyle c2Delta tDelta x the sign of t displaystyle Delta t changes meaning that the temporal order of spacelikeseparated events changes depending on the frame in which the events are viewed But the temporal order of timelikeseparated events is absolute since the only way that v

displaystyle vert Delta xDelta tvert c and this relationship is frame independent due to the invariance of s 2 displaystyle s2 From this we observe that the speed of light is c displaystyle c in every inertial frame In other words starting from the assumption of universal Lorentz covariance the constant speed of light is a derived result rather than a postulate as in the twopostulates formulation of the special theory Relativity of simultaneity Consider two events happening in two different locations that occur simultaneously in the reference frame of one inertial observer They may occur nonsimultaneously in the reference frame of another inertial observer lack of absolute simultaneity From Equation 3 the forward Lorentz transformation in terms of coordinate differences t t v x c 2 displaystyle Delta tgamma leftDelta tfrac vDelta xc2right It is clear that the two events that are simultaneous in frame S satisfying t 0 are not necessarily simultaneous in another inertial frame S satisfying t 0 Only if these events are additionally colocal in frame S satisfying x 0 will they be simultaneous in another frame S The Sagnac effect can be considered a manifestation of the relativity of simultaneity Since relativity of simultaneity is a first order effect in v displaystyle v instruments based on the Sagnac effect for their operation such as ring laser gyroscopes and fiber optic gyroscopes are capable of extreme levels of sensitivity Time dilation The time lapse between two events is not invariant from one observer to another but is dependent on the relative speeds of the observers reference frames Suppose a clock is at rest in the unprimed system S The location of the clock on two different ticks is then characterized by x 0 To find the relation between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems Equation 3 can be used to find t t displaystyle Delta tgamma Delta t for events satisfying x 0 displaystyle Delta x0 This shows that the time t between the two ticks as seen in the frame in which the clock is moving S is longer than the time t between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock S Time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena for example the lifetime of high speed muons created by the collision of cosmic rays with particles in the Earths outer atmosphere and moving towards the surface is greater than the lifetime of slowly moving muons created and decaying in a laboratory Whenever one hears a statement to the effect that moving clocks run slow one should envision an inertial reference frame thickly populated with identical synchronized clocks As a moving clock travels through this array its reading at any particular point is compared with a stationary clock at the same point 149152 The measurements that we would get if we actually looked at a moving clock would in general not at all be the same thing because the time that we would see would be delayed by the finite speed of light ie the times that we see would be distorted by the Doppler effect Measurements of relativistic effects must always be understood as having been made after finite speedoflight effects have been factored out 149152 Langevins lightclock Paul Langevin an early proponent of the theory of relativity did much to popularize the theory in the face of resistance by many physicists to Einsteins revolutionary concepts Among his numerous contributions to the foundations of special relativity were independent work on the massenergy relationship a thorough examination of the twin paradox and investigations into rotating coordinate systems His name is frequently attached to a hypothetical construct called a lightclock originally developed by Lewis and Tolman in 1909 which he used to perform a novel derivation of the Lorentz transformation A lightclock is imagined to be a box of perfectly reflecting walls wherein a light signal reflects back and forth from opposite faces The concept of time dilation is frequently taught using a lightclock that is traveling in uniform inertial motion perpendicular to a line connecting the two mirrors Langevin himself made use of a lightclock oriented parallel to its line of motion Consider the scenario illustrated in Fig 43A Observer A holds a lightclock of length L displaystyle L as well as an electronic timer with which she measures how long it takes a pulse to make a round trip up and down along the lightclock Although observer A is traveling rapidly along a train from her point of view the emission and receipt of the pulse occur at the same place and she measures the interval using a single clock located at the precise position of these two events For the interval between these two events observer A finds t A 2 L c displaystyle t_textA2Lc A time interval measured using a single clock that is motionless in a particular reference frame is called a proper time interval Fig 43B illustrates these same two events from the standpoint of observer B who is parked by the tracks as the train goes by at a speed of v displaystyle v Instead of making straight upanddown motions observer B sees the pulses moving along a zigzag line However because of the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light the speed of the pulses along these diagonal lines is the same c displaystyle c that observer A saw for her upanddown pulses B measures the speed of the vertical component of these pulses as c 2 v 2 textstyle pm sqrt c2v2 so that the total roundtrip time of the pulses is t B 2 L c 2 v 2 textstyle t_textB2Lbig sqrt c2v2 t A 1 v 2 c 2 displaystyle textstyle t_textAbig sqrt 1v2c2 Note that for observer B the emission and receipt of the light pulse occurred at different places and he measured the interval using two stationary and synchronized clocks located at two different positions in his reference frame The interval that B measured was therefore not a proper time interval because he did not measure it with a single resting clock Reciprocal time dilation In the above description of the Langevin lightclock the labeling of one observer as stationary and the other as in motion was completely arbitrary One could just as well have observer B carrying the lightclock and moving at a speed of v displaystyle v to the left in which case observer A would perceive Bs clock as running slower than her local clock There is no paradox here because there is no independent observer C who will agree with both A and B Observer C necessarily makes his measurements from his own reference frame If that reference frame coincides with As reference frame then C will agree with As measurement of time If Cs reference frame coincides with Bs reference frame then C will agree with Bs measurement of time If Cs reference frame coincides with neither As frame nor Bs frame then Cs measurement of time will disagree with both As and Bs measurement of time Twin paradox The reciprocity of time dilation between two observers in separate inertial frames leads to the socalled twin paradox articulated in its present form by Langevin in 1911 Langevin imagined an adventurer wishing to explore the future of the Earth This traveler boards a projectile capable of traveling at 99995 of the speed of light After making a roundtrip journey to and from a nearby star lasting only two years of his own life he returns to an Earth that is two hundred years older This result appears puzzling because both the traveler and an Earthbound observer would see the other as moving and so because of the reciprocity of time dilation one might initially expect that each should have found the other to have aged less In reality there is no paradox at all because in order for the two observers to perform sidebyside comparisons of their elapsed proper times the symmetry of the situation must be broken At least one of the two observers must change their state of motion to match that of the other Knowing the general resolution of the paradox however does not immediately yield the ability to calculate correct quantitative results Many solutions to this puzzle have been provided in the literature and have been reviewed in the Twin paradox article We will examine in the following one such solution to the paradox Our basic aim will be to demonstrate that after the trip both twins are in perfect agreement about who aged by how much regardless of their different experiences Fig 44 illustrates a scenario where the traveling twin flies at 06 c to and from a star 3 ly distant During the trip each twin sends yearly time signals measured in their own proper times to the other After the trip the cumulative counts are compared On the outward phase of the trip each twin receives the others signals at the lowered rate of f f 1 1 displaystyle textstyle ffsqrt 1beta 1beta Initially the situation is perfectly symmetric note that each twin receives the others oneyear signal at two years measured on their own clock The symmetry is broken when the traveling twin turns around at the fouryear mark as measured by her clock During the remaining four years of her trip she receives signals at the enhanced rate of f f 1 1 displaystyle textstyle ffsqrt 1beta 1beta The situation is quite different with the stationary twin Because of lightspeed delay he does not see his sister turn around until eight years have passed on his own clock Thus he receives enhancedrate signals from his sister for only a relatively brief period Although the twins disagree in their respective measures of total time we see in the following table as well as by simple observation of the Minkowski diagram that each twin is in total agreement with the other as to the total number of signals sent from one to the other There is hence no paradox 152159 Length contraction The dimensions eg length of an object as measured by one observer may be smaller than the results of measurements of the same object made by another observer eg the ladder paradox involves a long ladder traveling near the speed of light and being contained within a smaller garage Similarly suppose a measuring rod is at rest and aligned along the xaxis in the unprimed system S In this system the length of this rod is written as x To measure the length of this rod in the system S in which the rod is moving the distances x to the end points of the rod must be measured simultaneously in that system S In other words the measurement is characterized by t 0 which can be combined with Equation 4 to find the relation between the lengths x and x x x displaystyle Delta xfrac Delta xgamma for events satisfying t 0 displaystyle Delta t0 This shows that the length x of the rod as measured in the frame in which it is moving S is shorter than its length x in its own rest frame S Time dilation and length contraction are not merely appearances Time dilation is explicitly related to our way of measuring time intervals between events that occur at the same place in a given coordinate system called colocal events These time intervals which can be and are actually measured experimentally by relevant observers are different in another coordinate system moving with respect to the first unless the events in addition to being colocal are also simultaneous Similarly length contraction relates to our measured distances between separated but simultaneous events in a given coordinate system of choice If these events are not colocal but are separated by distance space they will not occur at the same spatial distance from each other when seen from another moving coordinate system Lorentz transformation of velocities Consider two frames S and S in standard configuration A particle in S moves in the x direction with velocity vector u displaystyle mathbf u What is its velocity u displaystyle mathbf u in frame S We can write Substituting expressions for d x displaystyle dx and d t displaystyle dt from Equation 5 into Equation 8 followed by straightforward mathematical manipulations and backsubstitution from Equation 7 yields the Lorentz transformation of the speed u displaystyle u to u displaystyle u The inverse relation is obtained by interchanging the primed and unprimed symbols and replacing v displaystyle v with v displaystyle v For u displaystyle mathbf u not aligned along the xaxis we write 4749 The forward and inverse transformations for this case are Equation 10 and Equation 14 can be interpreted as giving the resultant u displaystyle mathbf u of the two velocities v displaystyle mathbf v and u displaystyle mathbf u and they replace the formula u u v displaystyle mathbf uuv which is valid in Galilean relativity Interpreted in such a fashion they are commonly referred to as the relativistic velocity addition or composition formulas valid for the three axes of S and S being aligned with each other although not necessarily in standard configuration 4749 We note the following points If an object eg a photon were moving at the speed of light in one frame ie u c or u c then it would also be moving at the speed of light in any other frame moving at v c The resultant speed of two velocities with magnitude less than c is always a velocity with magnitude less than c If both u and v and then also u and v are small with respect to the speed of light that is eg uc 1 then the intuitive Galilean transformations are recovered from the transformation equations for special relativity Attaching a frame to a photon riding a light beam like Einstein considers requires special treatment of the transformations There is nothing special about the x direction in the standard configuration The above formalism applies to any direction and three orthogonal directions allow dealing with all directions in space by decomposing the velocity vectors to their components in these directions See Velocityaddition formula for details Thomas rotation The composition of two noncollinear Lorentz boosts ie two noncollinear Lorentz transformations neither of which involve rotation results in a Lorentz transformation that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a boost and a rotation Thomas rotation results from the relativity of simultaneity In Fig 45a a rod of length L displaystyle L in its rest frame ie having a proper length of L displaystyle L rises vertically along the yaxis in the ground frame In Fig 45b the same rod is observed from the frame of a rocket moving at speed v displaystyle v to the right If we imagine two clocks situated at the left and right ends of the rod that are synchronized in the frame of the rod relativity of simultaneity causes the observer in the rocket frame to observe not see the clock at the right end of the rod as being advanced in time by L v c 2 displaystyle Lvc2 and the rod is correspondingly observed as tilted 9899 Unlike secondorder relativistic effects such as length contraction or time dilation this effect becomes quite significant even at fairly low velocities For example this can be seen in the spin of moving particles where Thomas precession is a relativistic correction that applies to the spin of an elementary particle or the rotation of a macroscopic gyroscope relating the angular velocity of the spin of a particle following a curvilinear orbit to the angular velocity of the orbital motion 169174 Thomas rotation provides the resolution to the wellknown meter stick and hole paradox 9899 Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light In Fig 46 the time interval between the events A the cause and B the effect is timelike that is there is a frame of reference in which events A and B occur at the same location in space separated only by occurring at different times If A precedes B in that frame then A precedes B in all frames accessible by a Lorentz transformation It is possible for matter or information to travel below light speed from the location of A starting at the time of A to the location of B arriving at the time of B so there can be a causal relationship with A the cause and B the effect The interval AC in the diagram is spacelike that is there is a frame of reference in which events A and C occur simultaneously separated only in space There are also frames in which A precedes C as shown and frames in which C precedes A But no frames are accessible by a Lorentz transformation in which events A and C occur at the same location If it were possible for a causeandeffect relationship to exist between events A and C paradoxes of causality would result For example if signals could be sent faster than light then signals could be sent into the senders past observer B in the diagrams A variety of causal paradoxes could then be constructed Consider the spacetime diagrams in Fig 47 A and B stand alongside a railroad track when a highspeed train passes by with C riding in the last car of the train and D riding in the leading car The world lines of A and B are vertical ct distinguishing the stationary position of these observers on the ground while the world lines of C and D are tilted forwards ct reflecting the rapid motion of the observers C and D stationary in their train as observed from the ground Fig 47a The event of B passing a message to D as the leading car passes by is at the origin of Ds frame D sends the message along the train to C in the rear car using a fictitious instantaneous communicator The worldline of this message is the fat red arrow along the x displaystyle x axis which is a line of simultaneity in the primed frames of C and D In the unprimed ground frame the signal arrives earlier than it was sent Fig 47b The event of C passing the message to A who is standing by the railroad tracks is at the origin of their frames Now A sends the message along the tracks to B via an instantaneous communicator The worldline of this message is the blue fat arrow along the x displaystyle x axis which is a line of simultaneity for the frames of A and B As seen from the spacetime diagram B will receive the message before having sent it out a violation of causality It is not necessary for signals to be instantaneous to violate causality Even if the signal from D to C were slightly shallower than the x displaystyle x axis and the signal from A to B slightly steeper than the x displaystyle x axis it would still be possible for B to receive his message before he had sent it By increasing the speed of the train to near light speeds the c t displaystyle ct and x displaystyle x axes can be squeezed very close to the dashed line representing the speed of light With this modified setup it can be demonstrated that even signals only slightly faster than the speed of light will result in causality violation Therefore if causality is to be preserved one of the consequences of special relativity is that no information signal or material object can travel faster than light in vacuum This is not to say that all faster than light speeds are impossible Various trivial situations can be described where some things not actual matter or energy move faster than light For example the location where the beam of a search light hits the bottom of a cloud can move faster than light when the search light is turned rapidly although this does not violate causality or any other relativistic phenomenon Optical effects Dragging effects In 1850 Hippolyte Fizeau and Lon Foucault independently established that light travels more slowly in water than in air thus validating a prediction of Fresnels wave theory of light and invalidating the corresponding prediction of Newtons corpuscular theory The speed of light was measured in still water What would be the speed of light in flowing water In 1851 Fizeau conducted an experiment to answer this question a simplified representation of which is illustrated in Fig 51 A beam of light is divided by a beam splitter and the split beams are passed in opposite directions through a tube of flowing water They are recombined to form interference fringes indicating a difference in optical path length that an observer can view The experiment demonstrated that dragging of the light by the flowing water caused a displacement of the fringes showing that the motion of the water had affected the speed of the light According to the theories prevailing at the time light traveling through a moving medium would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus the speed of the medium Contrary to expectation Fizeau found that although light appeared to be dragged by the water the magnitude of the dragging was much lower than expected If u c n displaystyle ucn is the speed of light in still water and v displaystyle v is the speed of the water and u displaystyle u_pm is the waterborne speed of light in the lab frame with the flow of water adding to or subtracting from the speed of light then u c n v 1 1 n 2 displaystyle u_pm frac cnpm vleft1frac 1n2right Fizeaus results although consistent with Fresnels earlier hypothesis of partial aether dragging were extremely disconcerting to physicists of the time Among other things the presence of an index of refraction term meant that since n displaystyle n depends on wavelength the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time A variety of theoretical explanations were proposed to explain Fresnels dragging coefficient that were completely at odds with each other Even before the MichelsonMorley experiment Fizeaus experimental results were among a number of observations that created a critical situation in explaining the optics of moving bodies From the point of view of special relativity Fizeaus result is nothing but an approximation to Equation 10 the relativistic

and receiver include a transverse component then the direction from which light arrives at the receiver will be displaced from the geometric position in space of the source relative to the receiver The classical calculation of the displacement takes two forms and makes different predictions depending on whether the receiver the source or both are in motion with respect to the medium 1 If the receiver is in motion the displacement would be the consequence of the aberration of light The incident angle of the beam relative to the receiver would be calculable from the vector sum of the receivers motions and the velocity of the incident light 2 If the source is in motion the displacement would be the consequence of lighttime correction The displacement of the apparent position of the source from its geometric position would be the result of the sources motion during the time that its light takes to reach the receiver The classical explanation failed experimental test Since the aberration angle depends on the relationship between the velocity of the receiver and the speed of the incident light passage of the incident light through a refractive medium should change the aberration angle In 1810 Arago used this expected phenomenon in a failed attempt to measure the speed of light and in 1870 George Airy tested the hypothesis using a waterfilled telescope finding that against expectation the measured aberration was identical to the aberration measured with an airfilled telescope A cumbrous attempt to explain these results used the hypothesis of partial aetherdrag but was incompatible with the results of the MichelsonMorley experiment which apparently demanded complete aetherdrag Assuming inertial frames the relativistic expression for the aberration of light is applicable to both the receiver moving and source moving cases A variety of trigonometrically equivalent formulas have been published Expressed in terms of the variables in Fig 52 these include

are in motion with respect to the medium The relativistic Doppler effect is independent of any medium Nevertheless relativistic Doppler shift for the longitudinal case with source and receiver moving directly towards or away from each other can be derived as if it were the classical phenomenon but modified by the addition of a time dilation term and that is the treatment described here Assume the receiver and the source are moving away from each other with a relative speed v displaystyle v as measured by an observer on the receiver or the source The sign convention adopted here is that v displaystyle v is negative if the receiver and the source are moving towards each other Assume that the source is stationary in the medium Then f r 1 v c s f s displaystyle f_rleft1frac vc_srightf_s

1beta 2 is the Lorentz factor An identical expression for relativistic Doppler shift is obtained when performing the analysis in the reference frame of the receiver with a moving source Transverse Doppler effect The transverse Doppler effect is one of the main novel predictions of the special theory of relativity Classically one might expect that if source and receiver are moving transversely with respect to each other with no longitudinal component to their relative motions that there should be no Doppler shift in the light arriving at the receiver Special relativity predicts otherwise Fig 53 illustrates two common variants of this scenario Both variants can be analyzed using simple time dilation arguments In Fig 53a the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of displaystyle gamma In Fig 53b the light is redshifted by the same factor Measurement versus visual appearance Time dilation and length contraction are not optical illusions but genuine effects Measurements of these effects are not an artifact of Doppler shift nor are they the result of neglecting to take into account the time it takes light to travel from an event to an observer Scientists make a fundamental distinction between measurement or observation on the one hand versus visual appearance or what one sees The measured shape of an object is a hypothetical snapshot of all of the objects points as they exist at a single moment in time But the visual appearance of an object is affected by the varying lengths of time that light takes to travel from different points on the object to ones eye For many years the distinction between the two had not been generally appreciated and it had generally been thought that a length contracted object passing by an observer would in fact actually be seen as length contracted In 1959 James Terrell and Roger Penrose independently pointed out that differential time lag effects in signals reaching the observer from the different parts of a moving object result in a fast moving objects visual appearance being quite different from its measured shape For example a receding object would appear contracted an approaching object would appear elongated and a passing object would have a skew appearance that has been likened to a rotation A sphere in motion retains the circular outline for all speeds for any distance and for all view angles although the surface of the sphere and the images on it will appear distorted Both Fig 54 and Fig 55 illustrate objects moving transversely to the line of sight In Fig 54 a cube is viewed from a distance of four times the length of its sides At high speeds the sides of the cube that are perpendicular to the direction of motion appear hyperbolic in shape The cube is actually not rotated Rather light from the rear of the cube takes longer to reach ones eyes compared with light from the front during which time the cube has moved to the right At high speeds the sphere in Fig 55 takes on the appearance of a flattened disk tilted up to 45 from the line of sight If the objects motions are not strictly transverse but instead include a longitudinal component exaggerated distortions in perspective may be seen This illusion has come to be known as Terrell rotation or the TerrellPenrose effect Another example where visual appearance is at odds with measurement comes from the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies BL Lac objects quasars and other astronomical objects that eject relativisticspeed jets of matter at narrow angles with respect to the viewer An apparent optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel In Fig 56 galaxy M87 streams out a highspeed jet of subatomic particles almost directly towards us but PenroseTerrell rotation causes the jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in Fig 54 has been stretched out Dynamics Section Consequences derived from the Lorentz transformation dealt strictly with kinematics the study of the motion of points bodies and systems of bodies without considering the forces that caused the motion This section discusses masses forces energy and so forth and as such requires consideration of physical effects beyond those encompassed by the Lorentz transformation itself Equivalence of mass and energy As an objects speed approaches the speed of light from an observers point of view its relativistic mass increases thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observers frame of reference The energy content of an object at rest with mass m equals mc2 Conservation of energy implies that in any reaction a decrease of the sum of the masses of particles must be accompanied by an increase in kinetic energies of the particles after the reaction Similarly the mass of an object can be increased by taking in kinetic energies In addition to the papers referenced above which give derivations of the Lorentz transformation and describe the foundations of special relativityEinstein also wrote at least four papers giving heuristic arguments for the equivalence and transmutability of mass and energy for E mc2 Massenergy equivalence is a consequence of special relativity The energy and momentum which are separate in Newtonian mechanics form a fourvector in relativity and this relates the time component the energy to the space components the momentum in a nontrivial way For an object at rest the energymomentum fourvector is Ec 0 0 0 it has a time component which is the energy and three space components which are zero By changing frames with a Lorentz transformation in the x direction with a small value of the velocity v the energy momentum fourvector becomes Ec Evc2 0 0 The momentum is equal to the energy multiplied by the velocity divided by c2 As such the Newtonian mass of an object which is the ratio of the momentum to the velocity for slow velocities is equal to Ec2 The energy and momentum are properties of matter and radiation and it is impossible to deduce that they form a fourvector just from the two basic postulates of special relativity by themselves because these do not talk about matter or radiation they only talk about space and time The derivation therefore requires some additional physical reasoning In his 1905 paper Einstein used the additional principles that Newtonian mechanics should hold for slow velocities so that there is one energy scalar and one threevector momentum at slow velocities and that the conservation law for energy and momentum is exactly true in relativity Furthermore he assumed that the energy of light is transformed by the same Dopplershift factor as its frequency which he had previously shown to be true based on Maxwells equations The first of Einsteins papers on this subject was Does the Inertia of a Body Depend upon its Energy Content in 1905 Although Einsteins argument in this paper is nearly universally accepted by physicists as correct even selfevident many authors over the years have suggested that it is wrong Other authors suggest that the argument was merely inconclusive because it relied on some implicit assumptions Einstein acknowledged the controversy over his derivation in his 1907 survey paper on special relativity There he notes that it is problematic to rely on Maxwells equations for the heuristic massenergy argument The argument in his 1905 paper can be carried out with the emission of any massless particles but the Maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work To emit electromagnetic waves all you have to do is shake a charged particle and this is clearly doing work so that the emission is of energy Einsteins 1905 demonstration of E mc2 In his fourth of his 1905 Annus mirabilis papers Einstein presented a heuristic argument for the equivalence of mass and energy Although as discussed above subsequent scholarship has established that his arguments fell short of a broadly definitive proof the conclusions that he reached in this paper have stood the test of time Einstein took as starting assumptions his recently discovered formula for relativistic Doppler shift the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum and the relationship between the frequency of light and its energy as implied by Maxwells equations Fig 61 top Consider a system of plane waves of light having frequency f displaystyle f traveling in direction displaystyle phi relative to the xaxis of reference frame S The frequency and hence energy of the waves as measured in frame S that is moving along the xaxis at velocity v displaystyle v is given by the relativistic Doppler shift

stationary in reference frame S Let this body emit a pair of equalenergy lightpulses in opposite directions at angle displaystyle phi with respect to the xaxis Each pulse has energy L 2 displaystyle L2 Because of conservation of momentum the body remains stationary in S after emission of the two pulses Let E 0 displaystyle E_0 be the energy of the body before emission of the two pulses and E 1

The two differences of form H E displaystyle HE seen in the above equation have a straightforward physical interpretation Since H displaystyle H and E displaystyle E are the energies of the arbitrary body in the moving and stationary frames H 0 E 0 displaystyle H_0E_0 and H 1 E 1 displaystyle H_1E_1 represents the kinetic energies of the bodies before and after the emission of light except for an additive constant that fixes the zero point of energy and is conventionally set to zero Hence Taking a Taylor series expansion and neglecting higher order terms he obtained Comparing the above expression with the classical expression for kinetic energy KE 12mv2 Einstein then noted If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation its mass diminishes by Lc2 Rindler has observed that Einsteins heuristic argument suggested merely that energy contributes to mass In 1905 Einsteins cautious expression of the massenergy relationship allowed for the possibility that dormant mass might exist that would remain behind after all the energy of a body was removed By 1907 however Einstein was ready to assert that all inertial mass represented a reserve of energy To equate all mass with energy required an act of aesthetic faith very characteristic of Einstein 8184 Einsteins bold hypothesis has been amply confirmed in the years subsequent to his original proposal For a variety of reasons Einsteins original derivation is currently seldom taught Besides the vigorous debate that continues until this day as to the formal correctness of his original derivation the recognition of special relativity as being what Einstein called a principle theory has led to a shift away from reliance on electromagnetic phenomena to purely dynamic methods of proof How far can you travel from the Earth Since nothing can travel faster than light one might conclude that a human can never travel farther from Earth than 100 light years You would easily think that a traveler would never be able to reach more than the few solar systems that exist within the limit of 100 light years from Earth However because of time dilation a hypothetical spaceship can travel thousands of light years during a passengers lifetime If a spaceship could be built that accelerates at a constant 1g it will after one year be travelling at almost the speed of light as seen from Earth This is described by v t a t 1 a 2 t 2 c 2 displaystyle vtfrac atsqrt 1a2t2c2 where vt is the velocity at a time t a is the acceleration of the spaceship and t is the coordinate time as measured by people on Earth Therefore after one year of accelerating at 981 ms2 the spaceship will be travelling at v 0712 c and 0946 c after three years relative to Earth After three years of this acceleration with the spaceship achieving a velocity of 946 of the speed of light relative to Earth time dilation will result in each second experienced on the spaceship corresponding to 31 seconds back on Earth During their journey people on Earth will experience more time than they do since their clocks all physical phenomena would really be ticking 31 times faster than those of the spaceship A 5year round trip for the traveller will take 65 Earth years and cover a distance of over 6 lightyears A 20year round trip for them 5 years accelerating 5 decelerating twice each will land them back on Earth having travelled for 335 Earth years and a distance of 331 light years A full 40year trip at 1g will appear on Earth to last 58000 years and cover a distance of 55000 light years A 40year trip at 11 g will take 148000 years and cover about 140000 light years A oneway 28 year 14 years accelerating 14 decelerating as measured with the astronauts clock trip at 1g acceleration could reach 2000000 lightyears to the Andromeda Galaxy This same time dilation is why a muon travelling close to c is observed to travel much farther than c times its halflife when at rest Elastic collisions Examination of the collision products generated by particle accelerators around the world provides scientists evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the natural laws governing it Analysis of the collision products the sum of whose masses may vastly exceed the masses of the incident particles requires special relativity In Newtonian mechanics analysis of collisions involves use of the conservation laws for mass momentum and energy In relativistic mechanics mass is not independently conserved because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy We illustrate the differences that arise between the Newtonian and relativistic treatments of particle collisions by examining the simple case of two perfectly elastic colliding particles of equal mass Inelastic collisions are discussed in SpacetimeConservation laws Radioactive decay may be considered a sort of timereversed inelastic collision Elastic scattering of charged elementary particles deviates from ideality due to the production of Bremsstrahlung radiation Newtonian analysis Fig 62 provides a demonstration of the result familiar to billiard players that if a stationary ball is struck elastically by another one of the same mass assuming no sidespin or English then after collision the diverging paths of the two balls will subtend a right angle a In the stationary frame an incident sphere traveling at 2v strikes a stationary sphere b In

Consider the elastic collision scenario in Fig 63 between a moving particle colliding with an equal mass stationary particle Unlike the Newtonian case the angle between the two particles after collision is less than 90 is dependent on the angle of scattering and becomes smaller and smaller as the velocity of the incident particle approaches the speed of light The relativistic momentum and total relativistic energy of a particle are given by Conservation of momentum dictates that the sum of the momenta of the incoming particle and the stationary particle which initially has momentum 0 equals the sum of the momenta of the emergent particles Likewise the sum of the total relativistic energies of the incoming particle and the stationary particle which initially has total energy mc2 equals the sum of the total energies of the emergent particles Breaking down 65 into its components replacing v displaystyle v with the dimensionless displaystyle beta and factoring out common terms from 65 and 66 yields the following From these we obtain the following relationships For the symmetrical case in which displaystyle phi theta and 2 3 displaystyle beta _2beta _3 612 takes on the simpler form Beyond the basics Rapidity Lorentz transformations relate coordinates of events in one reference frame to those of another frame Relativistic composition of velocities is used to add two velocities together The formulas to perform the latter computations are nonlinear making them more complex than the corresponding Galilean formulas This nonlinearity is an artifact of our choice of parameters 4759 We have previously noted that in an xct spacetime diagram the points at some constant spacetime interval from the origin form an invariant hyperbola We have also noted that the coordinate systems of two spacetime reference frames in standard configuration are hyperbolically rotated with respect to each other The natural functions for expressing these relationships are the hyperbolic analogs of the trigonometric functions Fig 71a shows a unit circle with sina and cosa the only difference between this diagram and the familiar unit circle of elementary trigonometry being that a is interpreted not as the angle between the ray and the xaxis but as twice the area of the sector swept out by the ray from the xaxis Numerically the angle and 2 area measures for the unit circle are identical Fig 71b shows a unit hyperbola with sinha and cosha where a is likewise interpreted as twice the tinted area Fig 72 presents plots of the sinh cosh and tanh functions For the unit

Minkowski spacetime 9699 The advantages of using hyperbolic functions are such that some textbooks such as the classic ones by Taylor and Wheeler introduce their use at a very early stage 4vectors Fourvectors have been mentioned above in context of the energymomentum 4vector but without any great emphasis Indeed none of the elementary derivations of special relativity require them But once understood 4vectors and more generally tensors greatly simplify the mathematics and conceptual understanding of special relativity Working exclusively with such objects leads to formulas that are manifestly relativistically invariant which is a considerable advantage in nontrivial contexts For instance demonstrating relativistic invariance of Maxwells equations in their usual form is not trivial while it is merely a routine calculation really no more than an observation using the field strength tensor formulation On the other hand general relativity from the outset relies heavily on 4vectors and more generally tensors representing physically relevant entities Relating these via equations that do not rely on specific coordinates requires tensors capable of connecting such 4vectors even within a curved spacetime and not just within a flat one as in special relativity The study of tensors is outside the scope of this article which provides only a basic discussion of spacetime Definition of 4vectors A 4tuple A A 0 A 1 A 2 A 3 displaystyle AleftA_0A_1A_2A_3right is a 4vector if its component Ai transform between frames according to the Lorentz transformation If using c t x y z displaystyle ctxyz coordinates A is a 4vector if it transforms in the xdirection according to A 0 A 0 v c A 1 A 1 A 1 v c A 0 A 2 A 2 A 3 A 3 displaystyle beginalignedA_0gamma leftA_0vcA_1rightA_1gamma leftA_1vcA_0rightA_2A_2A_3A_3endaligned which comes from simply replacing ct with A0 and x with A1 in the earlier presentation of the Lorentz transformation As usual when we write x t etc we generally mean x t etc The last three components of a 4vector must be a standard vector in threedimensional space Therefore a 4vector must transform like c t x y z displaystyle cDelta tDelta xDelta yDelta z under Lorentz transformations as well as rotations 3659 Properties of 4vectors Closure under linear combination If A and B are 4vectors then C a A a B displaystyle CaAaB is also a 4vector Innerproduct invariance If A and B are 4vectors then their inner product scalar product is invariant ie their inner product is independent of the frame in which it is calculated Note how the calculation of inner product differs from the calculation of the inner product of a 3vector In the following A displaystyle vec A and B displaystyle vec B are 3vectors A B displaystyle Acdot Bequiv A 0 B 0 A 1 B 1 A 2 B 2 A 3 B 3 displaystyle A_0B_0A_1B_1A_2B_2A_3B_3equiv A 0 B 0 A B displaystyle A_0B_0vec Acdot vec B In addition to being invariant under Lorentz transformation the above inner product is also invariant under rotation in 3space Two vectors are said to be orthogonal if A B 0 displaystyle Acdot B0 Unlike the case with 3vectors orthogonal 4vectors are not necessarily at right angles to each other The rule is that two 4vectors are orthogonal if they are offset by equal and opposite angles from the 45 line which is the world line of a light ray This implies that a lightlike 4vector is orthogonal to itself Invariance of the magnitude of a vector The magnitude of a vector is the inner product of a 4vector with itself and is a frameindependent property As with intervals the magnitude may be positive negative or zero so that the vectors are referred to as timelike spacelike or null lightlike Note that a null vector is not the same as a zero vector A null vector is one for which A A 0 displaystyle Acdot A0 while a zero vector is one whose components are all zero Special cases illustrating the invariance of the norm include the invariant interval c 2 t 2 x 2 displaystyle c2t2x2 and the invariant length of the relativistic momentum vector E 2 p 2 c 2 displaystyle E2p2c2 178181 3659 Examples of 4vectors Displacement 4vector Otherwise known as the spacetime separation

the frame of the particle An accelerated particle does not have an inertial frame in which it is always at rest However an inertial frame can always be found that is momentarily comoving with the particle This frame the momentarily comoving reference frame MCRF enables application of special relativity to the analysis of accelerated particles Since photons move on null lines d 0 displaystyle dtau 0 for a photon and a 4velocity cannot be defined There is no frame in which a photon is at rest and no MCRF can be established along a photons path Energymomentum 4vector P E c p E c p x p y p z

displaystyle Evec pc The first component is the total energy including mass of the particle or system of particles in a given frame while the remaining components are its spatial momentum The energymomentum 4vector is a conserved quantity Acceleration 4vector This results from taking the derivative of the velocity 4vector with respect to displaystyle tau A d V d displaystyle Aequiv frac

the final components of the above 4vectors are all standard 3vectors corresponding to spatial 3momentum 3force etc 178181 3659 4vectors and physical law The first postulate of special relativity declares the equivalency of all inertial frames A physical law holding in one frame must apply in all frames since otherwise it would be possible to differentiate between frames Newtonian momenta fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation and Einstein preferred to change the definition of momentum to one involving 4vectors rather than give up on conservation of momentum Physical laws must be based on constructs that are frame independent This means that physical laws may take the form of equations connecting scalars which are always frame independent However equations involving 4vectors require the use of tensors with appropriate rank which themselves can be thought of as being built up from 4vectors 186 Acceleration It is a common misconception that special relativity is applicable only to inertial frames and that it is unable to handle accelerating objects or accelerating reference frames Actually accelerating objects can generally be analyzed without needing to deal with accelerating frames at all It is only when gravitation is significant that general relativity is required Properly handling accelerating frames does require some care however The difference between special and general relativity is that 1 In special relativity all velocities are relative but acceleration is absolute 2 In general relativity all motion is relative whether inertial accelerating or rotating To accommodate this difference general relativity uses curved spacetime In this section we analyze several scenarios involving accelerated reference frames DewanBeranBell spaceship paradox The DewanBeranBell spaceship paradox Bells spaceship paradox is a good example of a problem where intuitive reasoning unassisted by the geometric insight of the spacetime approach can lead to issues In Fig 74 two identical spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other They are connected by a string that is capable of only a limited amount of stretching before breaking At a given instant in our frame the observer frame both spaceships accelerate in the same direction along the line between them with the same constant proper acceleration Will the string break When the paradox was new and relatively unknown even professional physicists had difficulty working out the solution Two lines of reasoning lead to opposite conclusions Both arguments which are presented below are flawed even though one of them yields the correct answer 106 120122 To observers in the rest frame the spaceships start a distance L apart and remain the same distance apart during acceleration During acceleration L is a length contracted distance of the distance L L in the frame of the accelerating spaceships After a sufficiently long time will increase to a sufficiently large factor that the string must break Let A and B be the rear and front spaceships In the frame of the spaceships each spaceship sees the other spaceship doing the same thing that it is doing A says that B has the same acceleration that he has and B sees that A matches her every move So the spaceships stay the same distance apart and the string does not break 106 120122 The problem with the first argument is that there is no frame of the spaceships There cannot be because the two spaceships measure a growing distance between the two Because there is no common frame of the spaceships the length of the string is illdefined Nevertheless the conclusion is correct and the argument is mostly right The second argument however completely ignores the relativity of simultaneity 106 120122 A spacetime diagram Fig 75 makes the correct solution to this paradox almost immediately evident Two observers in Minkowski spacetime accelerate with constant magnitude k displaystyle k acceleration for proper time displaystyle sigma acceleration and elapsed time measured by the observers themselves not some inertial observer They are comoving and inertial before and after this phase In Minkowski geometry the length along the line of simultaneity A B displaystyle AB turns out to be greater than the length along the line of simultaneity A B displaystyle AB The length increase can be calculated with the help of the Lorentz transformation If as illustrated in Fig 75 the acceleration is finished the ships will remain at a constant offset in some frame S displaystyle S If x A displaystyle x_A and x B x

leftx_Avtrightx_Bgamma leftx_ALvtrightLx_Bx_Agamma Lendaligned The paradox as it were comes from the way that Bell constructed his example In the usual discussion of Lorentz contraction the rest length is fixed and the moving length shortens as measured in frame S displaystyle S As shown in Fig 75 Bells example asserts the moving lengths A B displaystyle AB and A B displaystyle AB measured in frame S displaystyle S to be fixed thereby forcing the rest frame length A B displaystyle AB in frame S displaystyle S to increase Accelerated observer with horizon Certain special relativity problem setups can lead to insight about phenomena normally associated with general relativity such as event horizons In the text accompanying Section Invariant hyperbola of the article Spacetime the magenta hyperbolae represented actual paths that are tracked by a constantly accelerating traveler in spacetime During periods of positive acceleration the travelers velocity just approaches the speed of light while measured in our frame the travelers acceleration constantly decreases Fig 76 details various features of the travelers motions with more specificity At any given moment her space axis is formed by a line passing through the origin and her current position on the hyperbola while her time axis is the tangent to the hyperbola at her position The velocity parameter displaystyle beta approaches a limit of one as c t displaystyle ct increases Likewise displaystyle gamma approaches infinity The shape of the invariant hyperbola corresponds to a path of constant proper acceleration This is demonstrable as follows We remember that c t x displaystyle beta ctx Since c 2 t 2 x 2 s 2 displaystyle c2t2x2s2 we conclude that c t c t c 2 t 2 s 2 displaystyle beta ctctsqrt c2t2s2 1 1 2

specific calculated scenario Terence A and Stella B initially stand together 100 light hours from the origin Stella lifts off at time 0 her spacecraft accelerating at 001 c per hour Every twenty hours Terence radios updates to Stella about the situation at home solid green lines Stella receives these regular transmissions but the increasing distance offset in part by time dilation causes her to receive Terences communications later and later as measured on her clock and she never receives any communications from Terence after 100 hours on his clock dashed green lines 110113 After 100 hours according to Terences clock Stella enters a dark region She has traveled outside Terences timelike future On the other hand Terence can continue to receive Stellas messages to him indefinitely He just has to wait long enough Spacetime has been divided into distinct regions separated by an apparent event horizon So long as Stella continues to accelerate she can never know what takes place behind this horizon 110113 Relativity and unifying electromagnetism Theoretical investigation in classical electromagnetism led to the discovery of wave propagation Equations generalizing the electromagnetic effects found that finite propagation speed of the E and B fields required certain behaviors on charged particles The general study of moving charges forms the LinardWiechert potential which is a step towards special relativity The Lorentz transformation of the electric field of a moving charge into a nonmoving observers reference frame results in the appearance of a mathematical term commonly called the magnetic field Conversely the magnetic field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely electrostatic field in a comoving frame of reference Maxwells equations are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the Universe As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined one speaks of electromagnetic fields Special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame Maxwells equations in the 3D form are already consistent with the physical content of special relativity although they are easier to manipulate in a manifestly covariant form that is in the language of tensor calculus Theories of relativity and quantum mechanics Special relativity can be combined with quantum mechanics to form relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics How general relativity and quantum mechanics can be unified is one of the unsolved problems in physics quantum gravity and a theory of everything which require a unification including general relativity too are active and ongoing areas in theoretical research The early BohrSommerfeld atomic model explained the fine structure of alkali metal atoms using both special relativity and the preliminary knowledge on quantum mechanics of the time In 1928 Paul Dirac constructed an influential relativistic wave equation now known as the Dirac equation in his honour that is fully compatible both with special relativity and with the final version of quantum theory existing after 1926 This equation not only described the intrinsic angular momentum of the electrons called spin it also led to the prediction of the antiparticle of the electron the positron and fine structure could only be fully explained with special relativity It was the first foundation of relativistic quantum mechanics On the other hand the existence of antiparticles leads to the conclusion that relativistic quantum mechanics is not enough for a more accurate and complete theory of particle interactions Instead a theory of particles interpreted as quantized fields called quantum field theory becomes necessary in which particles can be created and destroyed throughout space and time Status Special relativity in its Minkowski spacetime is accurate only when the absolute value of the gravitational potential is much less than c2 in the region of interest In a strong gravitational field one must use general relativity General relativity becomes special relativity at the limit of a weak field At very small scales such as at the Planck length and below quantum effects must be taken into consideration resulting in quantum gravity But at macroscopic scales and in the absence of strong gravitational fields special relativity is experimentally tested to extremely high degree of accuracy 1020 and thus accepted by the physics community Experimental results that appear to contradict it are not reproducible and are thus widely believed to be due to experimental errors Special relativity is mathematically selfconsistent and it is an organic part of all modern physical theories most notably quantum field theory string theory and general relativity in the limiting case of negligible gravitational fields Newtonian mechanics mathematically follows from special relativity at small velocities compared to the speed of light thus Newtonian mechanics can be considered as a special relativity of slow moving bodies See Classical mechanics for a more detailed discussion Several experiments predating Einsteins 1905 paper are now interpreted as evidence for relativity Of these it is known Einstein was aware of the Fizeau experiment before 1905 and historians have concluded that Einstein was at least aware of the MichelsonMorley experiment as early as 1899 despite claims he made in his later years that it played no role in his development of the theory The Fizeau experiment 1851 repeated by Michelson and Morley in 1886 measured the speed of light in moving media with results that are consistent with relativistic addition of colinear velocities The famous MichelsonMorley experiment 1881 1887 gave further support to the postulate that detecting an absolute reference velocity was not achievable It should be stated here that contrary to many alternative claims it said little about the invariance of the speed of light with respect to the source and observers velocity as both source and observer were travelling together at the same velocity at all times The TroutonNoble experiment 1903 showed that the torque on a capacitor is independent of position and inertial reference frame The Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace 1902 1904 showed that length contraction does not lead to birefringence for a comoving observer in accordance with the relativity principle Particle accelerators accelerate and measure the properties of particles moving at near the speed of light where their behavior is consistent with relativity theory and inconsistent with the earlier Newtonian mechanics These machines would simply not work if they were not engineered according to relativistic principles In addition a considerable number of modern experiments have been conducted to test special relativity Some examples Tests of relativistic energy and momentum testing the limiting speed of particles IvesStilwell experiment testing relativistic Doppler effect and time dilation Experimental testing of time dilation relativistic effects on a fastmoving particles halflife KennedyThorndike experiment time dilation in accordance with Lorentz transformations HughesDrever experiment testing isotropy of space and mass Modern searches for Lorentz violation various modern tests Experiments to test emission theory demonstrated that the speed of light is independent of the speed of the emitter Experiments to test the aether drag hypothesis no aether flow obstruction Technical discussion of spacetime Geometry of spacetime Comparison between flat Euclidean space and Minkowski space Special relativity uses a flat 4dimensional Minkowski space an example of a spacetime Minkowski spacetime appears to be very similar to the standard 3dimensional Euclidean space but there is a crucial difference with respect to time In 3D space the differential of distance line element ds is defined by d s 2 d x d x d x 1 2 d x 2 2 d x 3 2 displaystyle ds2dmathbf x cdot dmathbf x dx_12dx_22dx_32 where dx dx1 dx2 dx3 are the differentials of the three spatial dimensions In Minkowski geometry there is an extra dimension with coordinate X0 derived from time such that the distance differential fulfills d s 2 d X 0 2 d X 1 2 d X 2 2 d X 3 2 displaystyle ds2dX_02dX_12dX_22dX_32 where dX dX0 dX1 dX2 dX3 are the differentials of the four spacetime dimensions This suggests a deep theoretical insight special relativity is simply a rotational symmetry of our spacetime analogous to the rotational symmetry of Euclidean space see Fig 101 Just as Euclidean space uses a Euclidean metric so spacetime uses a Minkowski metric Basically special relativity can be stated as the invariance of any spacetime interval that is the 4D distance between any two events when viewed from any inertial reference frame All equations and effects of special relativity can be derived from this rotational symmetry the Poincar group of Minkowski spacetime The actual form of ds above depends on the metric and on the choices for the X0 coordinate To make the time coordinate look like the space coordinates it can be treated as imaginary X0 ict this is called a Wick rotation According to Misner Thorne and Wheeler 1971 23 ultimately the deeper understanding of both special and general relativity will come from the study of the Minkowski metric described below and to take X0 ct rather than a disguised Euclidean metric using ict as the time coordinate Some authors use X0 t with factors of c elsewhere to compensate for instance spatial coordinates are divided by c or factors of c2 are included in the metric tensor These numerous conventions can be superseded by using natural units where c 1 Then space and time have equivalent units and no factors of c appear anywhere 3D spacetime If we reduce the spatial dimensions to 2 so that we can represent the physics in a 3D space d s 2 d x 1 2 d x 2 2 c 2 d t 2 displaystyle ds2dx_12dx_22c2dt2 we see that the null geodesics lie along a dualcone see Fig 102 defined by the equation d s 2 0 d x 1 2 d x 2 2 c 2 d t 2 displaystyle ds20dx_12dx_22c2dt2 or simply d x 1 2 d x 2 2 c 2 d t 2 displaystyle dx_12dx_22c2dt2 which is the equation of a circle of radius c dt 4D spacetime If we extend this to three spatial dimensions the null geodesics are the 4dimensional cone d s 2 0 d x 1 2 d x 2 2 d x 3 2 c 2 d t 2 displaystyle ds20dx_12dx_22dx_32c2dt2 so d x 1 2 d x 2 2 d x 3 2 c 2 d t 2 displaystyle dx_12dx_22dx_32c2dt2 As illustrated in Fig 103 the null geodesics can be visualized as a set of continuous concentric spheres with radii c dt This null dualcone represents the line of sight of a point in space That is when we look at the stars and say The light from that star that I am receiving is X years old we are looking down this line of sight a null geodesic We are looking at an event a distance d x 1 2 x 2 2 x 3 2 textstyle dsqrt x_12x_22x_32 away and a time dc in the past For this reason the null dual cone is also known as the light cone The point in the lower left of the Fig 102 represents the star the origin represents the observer and the line represents the null geodesic line of sight The cone in the t region is the information that the point is receiving while the cone in the t section is the information that the point is sending The geometry of Minkowski space can be depicted using Minkowski diagrams which are useful also in understanding many of the thought experiments in special relativity Physics in spacetime Transformations of physical quantities between reference frames Above the Lorentz transformation for the time coordinate and three space coordinates illustrates that they are intertwined This is true more generally certain pairs of timelike and spacelike quantities naturally combine on equal footing under the same Lorentz transformation The Lorentz transformation in standard configuration above that is for a boost in the xdirection can be recast into matrix form as follows c t x y z 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 c t x y z c t x x c t y z displaystyle beginpmatrixctxyzendpmatrixbeginpmatrixgamma beta gamma 00beta gamma gamma 0000100001endpmatrixbeginpmatrixctxyzendpmatrixbeginpmatrixgamma ctgamma beta xgamma xbeta gamma ctyzendpmatrix In Newtonian mechanics quantities that have magnitude and direction are mathematically described as 3d vectors in Euclidean space and in general they are parametrized by time In special relativity this notion is extended by adding the appropriate timelike quantity to a spacelike vector quantity and we have 4d vectors or fourvectors in Minkowski spacetime The components of vectors are written using tensor index notation as this has numerous advantages The notation makes it clear the equations are manifestly covariant under the Poincar group thus bypassing the tedious calculations to check this fact In constructing such equations we often find that equations previously thought to be unrelated are in fact closely connected being part of the same tensor equation Recognizing other physical quantities as tensors simplifies their transformation laws Throughout upper indices superscripts are contravariant indices rather than exponents except when they indicate a square this should be clear from the context and lower indices subscripts are covariant indices For simplicity and consistency with the earlier equations Cartesian coordinates will be used The simplest example of a fourvector is the position of an event in spacetime which constitutes a timelike component ct and spacelike component x x y z in a contravariant position fourvector with components X X 0 X 1 X 2 X 3 c t x y z c t x displaystyle Xnu X0X1X2X3ctxyzctmathbf x where we define X0 ct so that the time coordinate has the same dimension of distance as the other spatial dimensions so that space and time are treated equally Now the transformation of the contravariant components of the position 4vector can be compactly written as X X displaystyle Xmu Lambda mu _nu Xnu where there is an implied summation on displaystyle nu from 0 to 3 and displaystyle Lambda mu _nu is a matrix More generally all contravariant components of a fourvector T displaystyle Tnu transform from one frame to another frame by a

by this rule An example of a fourdimensional second order antisymmetric tensor is the relativistic angular momentum which has six components three are the classical angular momentum and the other three are related to the boost of the center of mass of the system The derivative of the relativistic angular momentum with respect to proper time is the relativistic torque also second order

is also the stressenergy tensor for the electromagnetic field namely the electromagnetic stressenergy tensor Metric The metric tensor allows one to define the inner product of two vectors which in turn allows one to assign a magnitude to the vector Given the fourdimensional nature of spacetime the Minkowski metric has components valid with suitably chosen coordinates which can be arranged in a

E_textrestcright2mc2 We see that the rest energy is an independent invariant A rest energy can be calculated even for particles and systems in motion by translating to a frame in which momentum is zero The rest energy is related to the mass according to the celebrated equation discussed above E rest m c 2 displaystyle E_textrestmc2 The mass of systems measured in their center of momentum frame where total momentum is zero is given by the total energy of the system in this frame It may not be equal to the sum of individual system masses measured in other frames To use Newtons third law of motion both forces must be defined as the rate of change of momentum with respect to the same time coordinate That is it requires the 3D force defined above Unfortunately there is no tensor in 4D that contains the components of the 3D force vector among its components If a particle is not traveling at c one can transform the 3D force from the particles comoving reference frame into the observers reference frame This yields a 4vector called the fourforce It is the rate of change of the above energy momentum fourvector with respect to proper time The covariant version of the fourforce is F d P d m A displaystyle F_nu frac dP_nu dtau mA_nu In the rest frame of the object the time component of the fourforce is zero unless the invariant mass of the object is changing this requires a nonclosed system in which energymass is being directly added or removed from the object in which case it is the negative of that rate of change of mass times c In general though the components of the fourforce are not equal to the components of the threeforce because the three force is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to coordinate time that is dpdt while the fourforce is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to proper time that is dpd In a continuous medium the 3D density of force combines with the density of power to form a covariant 4vector The spatial part is the result of dividing the force on a small cell in 3space by the volume of that cell The time component is 1c times the power transferred to that cell divided by the volume of the cell This will be

    title: "Industrial Revolution",
    originalContent:
      "The Industrial Revolution sometimes divided into the First Industrial Revolution and Second Industrial Revolution was a period of global transition of the human economy towards more widespread efficient and stable manufacturing processes that succeeded the Agricultural Revolution Beginning in Great Britain the Industrial Revolution spread to continental Europe and the United States from around 1760 to about 18201840 This transition included going from hand production methods to machines new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes the increasing use of water power and steam power the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanised factory system Output greatly increased and the result was an unprecedented rise in population and the rate of population growth The textile industry was the first to use modern production methods 40 and textiles became the dominant industry in terms of employment value of output and capital invested Many of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin By the mid18th century Britain was the worlds leading commercial nation controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean Britain had major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent particularly with the protoindustrialised Mughal Bengal through the activities of the East India Company The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution 15 Developments in law also facilitated the revolution such as courts ruling in favour of property rights An entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution helped drive industrialisation in Britain which after 1800 was emulated in Belgium the United States and France The Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in history comparable only to humanitys adoption of agriculture with respect to material advancement The Industrial Revolution influenced in some way almost every aspect of daily life In particular average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth Some economists have said the most important effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the Western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history although others have said that it did not begin to improve meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy while the Industrial Revolution began an era of percapita economic growth in capitalist economies Economic historians agree that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in human history since the domestication of animals and plants The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians as is the pace of economic and social changes According to Cambridge historian Leigh ShawTaylor Britain was already industrialising in the 17th century and Our database shows that a groundswell of enterprise and productivity transformed the economy in the 17th century laying the foundations for the worlds first industrial economy Britain was already a nation of makers by the year 1700 and the history of Britain needs to be rewritten Eric Hobsbawm held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s while T S Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 Rapid adoption of mechanized textiles spinning occurred in Britain in the 1780s and high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurred after 1800 Mechanised textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century with important centres of textiles iron and coal emerging in Belgium and the United States and later textiles in France An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the Industrial Revolutions early innovations such as mechanised spinning and weaving slowed as their markets matured and despite the increasing adoption of locomotives steamboats and steamships and hot blast iron smelting New technologies such as the electrical telegraph widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s in the United Kingdom and the United States were not powerful enough to drive high rates of economic growth Rapid economic growth began to reoccur after 1870 springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the Second Industrial Revolution These included new steelmaking processes mass production assembly lines electrical grid systems the largescale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steampowered factories Etymology The earliest recorded use of the term Industrial Revolution was in July 1799 by French envoy LouisGuillaume Otto announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise In his 1976 book Keywords A Vocabulary of Culture and Society Raymond Williams states in the entry for Industry The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen between 1811 and 1818 and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the 19th century The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s as in JrmeAdolphe Blanquis description in 1837 of la rvolution industrielle Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of an industrial revolution a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society Although Engels wrote his book in the 1840s it was not translated into English until the late 19th century and his expression did not enter everyday language until then Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term Economic historians and authors such as Mendels Pomeranz and Kridte argue that protoindustrialisation in parts of Europe the Muslim world Mughal India and China created the social and economic conditions that led to the Industrial Revolution thus causing the Great Divergence Some historians such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and that the term revolution is a misnomer This is still a subject of debate among some historians Requirements Six factors facilitated industrialisation high levels of agricultural productivity such as that reflected in the British Agricultural Revolution to provide excess manpower and food a pool of managerial and entrepreneurial skills available ports rivers canals and roads to cheaply move raw materials and outputs natural resources such as coal iron and waterfalls political stability and a legal system that supported business and financial capital available to invest Once industrialisation began in Great Britain new factors can be added the eagerness of British entrepreneurs to export industrial expertise and the willingness to import the process Britain met the criteria and industrialized starting in the 18th century and then it exported the process to western Europe especially Belgium France and the German states in the early 19th century The United States copied the British model in the early 19th century and Japan copied the Western European models in the late 19th century Important technological developments The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations beginning in the second half of the 18th century By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies Textiles mechanised cotton spinning powered by water and later steam increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500 The power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40 The cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50 Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen but they were not as great as in cotton Steam power the efficiency of steam engines increased so that they used between onefifth and onetenth as much fuel The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses 82 The highpressure engine had a high powertoweight ratio making it suitable for transportation Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800 Iron making the substitution of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost of pig iron and wrought iron production 8993 Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces resulting in economies of scale The steam engine began being used to power blast air indirectly by pumping water to a water wheel in the 1750s enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760 It was later improved by making it double acting which allowed higher blast furnace temperatures The puddling process produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the finery forge The rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron Developed in 1828 hot blast greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades Invention of machine tools the first machine tools invented were the screwcutting lathe the cylinder boring machine and the milling machine Machine tools made the economical manufacture of precision metal parts possible although it took several decades to develop effective techniques for making interchangeable parts Textile manufacture British textile industry statistics In 1750 Britain imported 25 million pounds of raw cotton most of which was spun and woven by the cottage industry in Lancashire The work was done by hand in workers homes or occasionally in master weavers shops Wages in Lancashire were about six times those in India in 1770 when overall productivity in Britain was about three times higher than in India In 1787 raw cotton consumption was 22 million pounds most of which was cleaned carded and spun on machines 4142 The British textile industry used 52 million pounds of cotton in 1800 which increased to 588 million pounds in 1850 The share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 26 in 1760 17 in 1801 and 224 in 1831 Value added by the British woollen industry was 141 in 1801 Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797 In 1760 approximately onethird of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported rising to twothirds by 1800 In 1781 cotton spun amounted to 51 million pounds which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800 In 1800 less than 01 of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in Britain In 1788 there were 50000 spindles in Britain rising to 7 million over the next 30 years Wool The earliest European attempts at mechanised spinning were with wool however wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanise than cotton Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant but far less than that of cotton Silk Arguably the first highly mechanised factory was John Lombes waterpowered silk mill at Derby operational by 1721 Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy however because the Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely the state of the industry at that time is unknown Although Lombes factory was technically successful the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition In order to promote manufacturing the Crown paid for models of Lombes machinery which were exhibited in the Tower of London Cotton Parts of India China Central America South America and the Middle East have a long history of hand manufacturing cotton textiles which became a major industry sometime after 1000 AD In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households largely for domestic consumption In the 15th century China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth By the 17th century almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a medium of exchange In India a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets often produced by professional weavers Some merchants also owned small weaving workshops India produced a variety of cotton cloth some of exceptionally fine quality Cotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the Americas The early Spanish explorers found Native Americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton sea island cotton Gossypium barbadense and upland green seeded cotton Gossypium hirsutum Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South Carolina but did poorly inland Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650s Upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern US but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed a problem solved by the cotton gin 157 A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez Mississippi in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90 of world cotton production today it produced bolls that were three to four times faster to pick Trade and textiles The Age of Discovery was followed by a period of colonialism beginning around the 16th century Following the discovery of a trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese the British founded the East India Company along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia including the Indonesian archipelago where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia and Europe By the mid1760s cloth was over threequarters of the East India Companys exports Indian textiles were in demand in the North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available however the number of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century Premechanized European textile production By 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established They were left alone by the guilds who did not consider cotton a threat Earlier European attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12thcentury Italy and 15thcentury southern Germany but these industries eventually ended when the supply of cotton was cut off The Moors in Spain grew spun and wove cotton beginning around the 10th century British cloth could not compete with Indian cloth because Indias labour cost was approximately onefifth to onesixth that of Britains In 1700 and 1721 the British government passed Calico Acts to protect the domestic woollen and linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around Lancashire that produced fustian a cloth with flax warp and cotton weft Flax was used for the warp because wheelspun cotton did not have sufficient strength but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100 cotton and was more difficult to sew On the eve of the Industrial Revolution spinning and weaving were done in households for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the puttingout system Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver Under the puttingout system homebased workers produced under contract to merchant sellers who often supplied the raw materials In the offseason the women typically farmers wives did the spinning and the men did the weaving Using the spinning wheel it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one handloom weaver 823 Invention of textile machinery The flying shuttle patented in 1733 by John Kaywith a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747doubled the output of a weaver worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when Johns son Robert invented the dropbox which facilitated changing thread colors 821822 Lewis Paul patented the roller spinning frame and the flyerandbobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of Birmingham Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their rolling machine powered by a donkey In 1743 a factory opened in Northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatts machines This operated until about 1764 A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster but this burnt down Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748 Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill In 1764 in the village of Stanhill Lancashire James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny which he patented in 1770 It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel by first clamping down on the fibres then by drawing them out followed by twisting It was a simple wooden framed machine that only cost about 6 for a 40spindle model in 1792 and was used mainly by home spinners The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft not warp 825827 The spinning frame or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who along with two partners patented it in 1769 The design was partly based on a spinning machine built by Kay who was hired by Arkwright 827830 For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers each operating at a successively higher rotating speed to draw out the fibre which was then twisted by the spindle The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread The top rollers were leathercovered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers The bottom rollers were wood and metal with fluting along the length The water frame was able to produce a hard mediumcount thread suitable for warp finally allowing 100 cotton cloth to be made in Britain Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford Derbyshire in 1771 giving the invention its name Samuel Crompton invented the spinning mule in 1779 so called because it is a hybrid of Arkwrights water frame and James Hargreavess spinning jenny in the same way that a mule is the product of crossbreeding a female horse with a male donkey Cromptons mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost Mulespun thread was of suitable strength to be used as a warp and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities 832 Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical power loom which he patented in 1785 In 1776 he patented a twoman operated loom 834 Cartwrights loom design had several flaws the most serious being thread breakage Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813 Horocks loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts Hill Co Roberts was additionally a maker of highquality machine tools and a pioneer in the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed Eli Whitney responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive cotton gin A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously have taken two months to process working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day These advances were capitalised on by entrepreneurs of whom the best known is Arkwright He is credited with a list of inventions but these were actually developed by such people as Kay and Thomas Highs Arkwright nurtured the inventors patented the ideas financed the initiatives and protected the machines He created the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a factory and he developed the use of powerfirst horsepower and then water powerwhich made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning carding twisting and spinning and rolling so that the supply of yarn increased greatly Steam power was then applied to drive textile machinery Manchester acquired the nickname Cottonopolis during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories Although mechanisation dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth by the mid19th century machinewoven cloth still could not equal the quality of handwoven Indian cloth in part because of the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India which allowed high thread counts However the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell handspun and woven fabric in lowwage India eventually destroying the Indian industry Iron industry British iron production statistics Bar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails wire hinges horseshoes wagon tires chains etc as well as structural shapes A small amount of bar iron was converted into steel Cast iron was used for pots stoves and other items where its brittleness was tolerable Most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron with substantial losses Bar iron was made by the bloomery process which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century In the UK in 1720 there were 20500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke In 1750 charcoal iron production was 24500 and coke iron was 2500 tons In 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14000 tons while coke iron production was 54000 tons In 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7800 tons and coke cast iron was 250000 tons 125 In 1750 the UK imported 31200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using coke In 1796 the UK was making 125000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6400 tons with charcoal imports were 38000 tons and exports were 24600 tons In 1806 the UK did not import bar iron but exported 31500 tons 125 Iron process innovations A major change in the iron industries during the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of wood and other biofuels with coal for a given amount of heat mining coal required much less labour than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal and coal was much more abundant than wood supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century 122 In 1709 Abraham Darby made progress using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale However the coke pig iron he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods such as pots and kettles He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots cast by his patented process were thinner and cheaper than theirs In 1750 coke had generally replaced charcoal in the smelting of copper and lead and was in widespread use in glass production In the smelting and refining of iron coal and coke produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coals sulfur content Low sulfur coals were known but they still contained harmful amounts Conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content 122125 A minority of coals are coking Another factor limiting the iron industry before the Industrial Revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows This limitation was overcome by the steam engine Use of coal in iron smelting started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution based on innovations by Clement Clerke and others from 1678 using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas These were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture reducing the oxide to metal This has the advantage that impurities such as sulphur ash in the coal do not migrate into the metal This technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687 It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace The foundry cupola is a different and later innovation Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron until 175556 when Darbys son Abraham Darby II built furnaces at Horsehay and Ketley where low sulfur coal was available and not far from Coalbrookdale These furnaces were equipped with waterpowered bellows the water being pumped by Newcomen steam engines The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast Abraham Darby III installed similar steampumped waterpowered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768 The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country 123125 Steam engines made the use of higherpressure and volume blast practical however the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace In 1757 ironmaster John Wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered blowing engine for blast furnaces The blowing cylinder for blast furnaces was introduced in 1760 and the first blowing cylinder made of cast iron is believed to be the one used at Carrington in 1768 that was designed by John Smeaton 124 135 Cast iron cylinders for use with a piston were difficult to manufacture the cylinders had to be free of holes and had to be machined smooth and straight to remove any warping James Watt had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine In 1774 Wilkinson invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1776 he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders After Watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782 they were widely applied to blowing hammering rolling and slitting 124 The solutions to the sulfur problem were the addition of sufficient limestone to the furnace to force sulfur into the slag as well as the use of low sulfur coal The use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a freeflowing slag The increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height 123125 In addition to lower cost and greater availability coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials iron ore fuel slag flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century As cast iron became cheaper and widely available it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings A famous early example is the Iron Bridge built in 1778 with cast iron produced by Abraham Darby III However most cast iron was converted to wrought iron Conversion of cast iron had long been done in a finery forge An improved refining process known as potting and stamping was developed but this was superseded by Henry Corts puddling process Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes rolling in 1783 and puddling in 1784 91 Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost Puddling was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod The decarburized iron having a higher melting point than cast iron was raked into globs by the puddler When the glob was large enough the puddler would remove it Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work Few puddlers lived to be 40 218 Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace coal or coke could be used as fuel The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by mild steel Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs it was never successfully mechanised Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a trip hammer A different use of rolling which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag was in the production of iron sheets and later structural shapes such as beams angles and rails The puddling process was improved in 1818 by Baldwyn Rogers who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide In 1838 John Hall patented the use of roasted tap cinder iron silicate for the furnace bottom greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom The tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus but this was not understood at the time 166 Halls process also used iron scale or rust which reacted with carbon in the molten iron Halls process called wet puddling reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50 to around 8 93 Puddling became widely used after 1800 Up to that time British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from Sweden and Russia to supplement domestic supplies Because of the increased British production imports began to decline in 1785 and by the 1790s Britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron Hot blast patented by the Scottish inventor James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron By using preheated combustion air the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between onethird using coke or twothirds using coal the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces increasing their capacity Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron This meant that lower quality coal could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive however by the end of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably Shortly before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the production of steel which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do such as for cutting edge tools and for springs Benjamin Huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the 1740s The raw material for this was blister steel made by the cementation process The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries such as those making nails hinges wire and other hardware items The development of machine tools allowed better working of iron causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries Steam power The development of the stationary steam engine was an important element of the Industrial Revolution however during the early period of the Industrial Revolution most industrial power was supplied by water and wind In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10000 horsepower was being supplied by steam By 1815 steam power had grown to 210000 hp The first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was patented by Thomas Savery in 1698 He constructed in London a lowlift combined vacuum and pressure water pump that generated about one horsepower hp and was used in numerous waterworks and in a few mines hence its brand name The Miners Friend Saverys pump was economical in small horsepower ranges but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by Thomas Newcomen before 1712 Newcomen engines were installed for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines with the engine on the surface these were large machines requiring a significant amount of capital to build and produced upwards of 35 kW 5 hp They were also used to power municipal water supply pumps They were extremely inefficient by modern standards but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads they opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper Despite their disadvantages Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century By 1729 when Newcomen died his engines had spread to Hungary in 1722 and then to Germany Austria and Sweden A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired of which 14 were abroad In the 1770s the engineer John Smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements A total of 1454 engines had been built by 1800 A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by Scotsman James Watt With financial support from his business partner Englishman Matthew Boulton he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine which incorporated a series of radical improvements notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder thereby making the lowpressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam Likewise the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder also improving efficiency These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton and Watts engines used only 2025 as much coal per horsepowerhour as Newcomens Boulton and Watt opened the Soho Foundry for the manufacture of such engines in 1795 In 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a doubleacting rotative type which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill Both of Watts basic engine types were commercially very successful and by 1800 the firm Boulton Watt had constructed 496 engines with 164 driving reciprocating pumps 24 serving blast furnaces and 308 powering mill machinery most of the engines generated from 35 to 75 kW 5 to 10 hp Until about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine built as an integral part of a stone or brick enginehouse but soon various patterns of selfcontained rotative engines readily removable but not on wheels were developed such as the table engine Around the start of the 19th century at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick and the American Oliver Evans began to construct higherpressure noncondensing steam engines exhausting against the atmosphere High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steamboats Small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread electrification in the early 20th century These included crankpowered treadlepowered and horsepowered workshop and light industrial machinery Machine tools Preindustrial machinery was built by various craftsmenmillwrights built watermills and windmills carpenters made wooden framing and smiths and turners made metal parts Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity and the various joints tended to rack work loose over time As the Industrial Revolution progressed machines with metal parts and frames became more common Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners such as machine screws bolts and nuts There was also the need for precision in making parts Precision would allow better working machinery interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners The demand for metal parts led to the development of several machine tools They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batchproduce small mechanisms Before the advent of machine tools metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers files scrapers saws and chisels Consequently the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum Hand methods of production were laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve The first large precision machine tool was the cylinder boring machine invented by John Wilkinson in 1774 It was designed to bore the large cylinders on early steam engines Wilkinsons machine was the first to use the principle of lineboring where the tool is supported on both ends unlike earlier designs used for boring cannon that relied on a less stable cantilevered boring bar The planing machine the milling machine and the shaping machine were developed in the early decades of the 19th century Although the milling machine was invented at this time it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century James Fox of Derby and Matthew Murray of Leeds were manufacturers of machine tools who found success in exporting from England and are also notable for having developed the planer around the same time as Richard Roberts of Manchester Henry Maudslay who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal Woolwich He worked as an apprentice at the Royal Arsenal under Jan Verbruggen In 1774 Verbruggen had installed a horizontal boring machine which was the first industrial size lathe in the UK Maudslay was hired away by Joseph Bramah for the production of highsecurity metal locks that required precision craftsmanship Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe 392395 Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs some of which copied from a template 392395 The slide rest lathe was called one of historys most important inventions Although it was not entirely Maudslays idea he was the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw slide rest and change gears 31 36 Maudslay left Bramahs employment and set up his own shop He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships pulley blocks for the Royal Navy in the Portsmouth Block Mills These machines were allmetal and were the first machines for mass production and making components with a degree of interchangeability The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work such as Richard Roberts Joseph Clement and Joseph Whitworth The techniques to make massproduced metal parts of sufficient precision to be interchangeable is largely attributed to a program of the US Department of War which perfected interchangeable parts for firearms in the early 19th century In the halfcentury following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the machine industry became the largest industrial sector of the US economy by value added Chemicals The largescale production of chemicals was an important development during the Industrial Revolution The first of these was the production of sulphuric acid by the lead chamber process invented by the Englishman John Roebuck James Watts first partner in 1746 He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger less expensive chambers made of riveted sheets of lead Instead of making a small amount each time he was able to make around 50 kilograms 100 pounds in each of the chambers at least a tenfold increase The production of an alkali on a large scale became an important goal as well and Nicolas Leblanc succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of sodium carbonate soda ash The Leblanc process was a reaction of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulfate and hydrochloric acid The sodium sulfate was heated with calcium carbonate and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulfide The process produced a large amount of pollution the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the atmosphere and calcium sulfide was a waste product Nonetheless this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that produced from burning specific plants barilla or kelp which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash and also to potash potassium carbonate produced from hardwood ashes These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions replacing many smallscale operations with more costeffective and controllable processes Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass textile soap and paper industries Early uses for sulfuric acid included pickling removing rust from iron and steel and for bleaching cloth The development of bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite by Scottish chemist Charles Tennant in about 1800 based on the discoveries of French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required from months to days for the traditional process then in use which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk Tennants factory at St Rollox Glasgow became the largest chemical plant in the world After 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in dyestuffs and Germany took world leadership building a strong chemical industry Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the 18601914 era to learn the latest techniques British scientists by contrast lacked research universities and did not train advanced students instead the practice was to hire Germantrained chemists Concrete In 1824 Joseph Aspdin a British bricklayer turned builder patented a chemical process for making portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades This process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1400 C 2552 F then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water sand and gravel to produce concrete Portland cement concrete was used by the English engineer Marc Isambard Brunel several years later when constructing the Thames Tunnel Concrete was used on a large scale in the construction of the London sewer system a generation later Gas lighting Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere the largescale introduction of gas lighting was the work of William Murdoch an employee of Boulton Watt The process consisted of the largescale gasification of coal in furnaces the purification of the gas removal of sulphur ammonia and heavy hydrocarbons and its storage and distribution The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820 They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil lamps Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before Glass making Glass was made in ancient Greece and Rome A new method of glass production known as the cylinder process was developed in Europe during the early 19th century In 1832 this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet glass They became the leading producers of window and plate glass This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure Paper machine A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by LouisNicolas Robert in France The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier who were stationers in London Although greatly improved and with many variations the Fourdrinier machine is the predominant means of paper production today The method of continuous production demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other continuous production processes Agriculture The British Agricultural Revolution is considered one of the causes of the Industrial Revolution because improved agricultural productivity freed up workers to work in other sectors of the economy In contrast percapita food supply in Europe was stagnant or declining and did not improve in some parts of Europe until the late 18th century The English lawyer Jethro Tull invented an improved seed drill in 1701 It was a mechanical seeder that distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth This was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five Tulls seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an effect Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century 26 Joseph Foljambes Rotherham plough of 1730 was the first commercially successful iron plough 122 18 21 The threshing machine invented by the Scottish engineer Andrew Meikle in 1784 displaced hand threshing with a flail a laborious job that took about onequarter of agricultural labour 286 Lower labor requirements subsequently result in lowered wages and numbers of farm labourers who faced near starvation leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the Swing Riots Machine tools and metalworking techniques developed during the Industrial Revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for massproducing agricultural equipment such as reapers binders and combine harvesters Mining Coal mining in Britain particularly in South Wales started early Before the steam engine pits were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface which were abandoned as the coal was extracted In other cases if the geology was favourable the coal was mined by means of an adit or drift mine driven into the side of a hill Shaft mining was done in some areas but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a sough a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine In either case the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity The introduction of the steam pump by Thomas Savery in 1698 and the Newcomen steam engine in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper enabling more coal to be extracted These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution but the adoption of John Smeatons improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watts more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines making mines more profitable The Cornish engine developed in the 1810s was much more efficient than the Watt steam engine Coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of firedamp in many coal seams Some degree of safety was provided by the safety lamp which was invented in 1816 by Sir Humphry Davy and independently by George Stephenson However the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light Firedamp explosions continued often setting off coal dust explosions so casualties grew during the entire 19th century Conditions of work were very poor with a high casualty rate from rock falls Transportation At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea Wagonways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment but canals had not yet been widely constructed Animals supplied all of the motive power on land with sails providing the motive power on the sea The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century Improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed by 50 between 1750 and 1830 The Industrial Revolution improved Britains transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network a canal and waterway network and a railway network Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly Canals and improved waterways Before and during the Industrial Revolution navigation on several British rivers was improved by removing obstructions straightening curves widening and deepening and building navigation locks Britain had over 1600 kilometres 1000 mi of navigable rivers and streams by 1750 46 Canals and waterways allowed bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland This was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart Canals began to be built in the UK in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country Known for its huge commercial success the Bridgewater Canal in North West England which opened in 1761 and was mostly funded by The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater From Worsley to the rapidly growing town of Manchester its construction cost 168000 22589130 as of 2013 but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761 the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building known as Canal Mania Canals were hastily built with the aim of replicating the commercial success of the Bridgewater Canal the most notable being the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Thames and Severn Canal which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively By the 1820s a national network was in existence Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on The last major canal to be built in the United Kingdom was the Manchester Ship Canal which upon opening in 1894 was the largest ship canal in the world and opened Manchester as a port However it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways which were quicker and often cheaper Britains canal network together with its surviving mill buildings is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain Roads France was known for having an excellent system of roads at the time of the Industrial Revolution however most of the roads on the European continent and in the UK were in bad condition and dangerously rutted Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes but from the 1720s and occasionally earlier turnpike trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a turnpike trust New engineered roads were built by John Metcalf Thomas Telford and most notably John McAdam with the first macadam stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate Bristol in 1816 The first macadam road in the US was the Boonsborough Turnpike Road between Hagerstown and Boonsboro Maryland in 1823 The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow broadwheeled carts hauled by teams of horses Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of packhorse Stagecoaches carried the rich and the less wealthy could pay to ride on carriers carts Productivity of road transport increased greatly during the Industrial Revolution and the cost of travel fell dramatically Between 1690 and 1840 productivity almost tripled for longdistance carrying and increased fourfold in stage coaching Railways Railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive puddled iron after 1800 the rolling mill for making rails and the development of the highpressure steam engine also around 1800 Reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons This was demonstrated on an iron platecovered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon England A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds or one ton A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration Twelve wagons were loaded with stones till each wagon weighed three tons and the wagons were fastened together A horse was then attached which drew the wagons with ease six miles 10 km in two hours having stopped four times in order to show he had the power of starting as well as drawing his great load Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal These were all horsedrawn or relied on gravity with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline The first applications of the steam locomotive were on wagon or plate ways as they were then often called from the castiron plates used Horsedrawn public railways begin in the early 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs Steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of highpressure steam engines after the expiration of the Boulton and Watt patent in 1800 Highpressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere doing away with the condenser and cooling water They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines A few of these early locomotives were used in mines Steamhauled public railways began with the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 The rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 Rainhill trials which demonstrated Robert Stephensons successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of hot blast which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity of the blast furnace On 15 September 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway the first intercity railway in the world was opened and was attended by Prime Minister Arthur Wellesley The railway was engineered by Joseph Locke and George Stephenson linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of Manchester with the port town of Liverpool The opening was marred by problems caused by the primitive nature of the technology being employed however problems were gradually solved and the railway became highly successful transporting passengers and freight The success of the intercity railway particularly in the transport of freight and commodities led to Railway Mania Construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution After many of the workers had completed the railways they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities providing additional workers for the factories Social effects On a structural level the Industrial Revolution asked society the socalled social question demanding new ideas for managing large groups of individuals Visible poverty on one hand and growing population and materialistic wealth on the other caused tensions between the very rich and the poorest people within society These tensions were sometimes violently released and led to philosophical ideas such as socialism communism and anarchism Factory system Prior to the Industrial Revolution most of the workforce was employed in agriculture either as selfemployed farmers as landowners or tenants or as landless agricultural labourers It was common for families in various parts of the world to spin yarn weave cloth and make their own clothing Households also spun and wove for market production At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution India China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East produced most of the worlds cotton cloth while Europeans produced wool and linen goods In Great Britain in the 16th century the puttingout system was practised by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for a market in their homes often described as cottage industry Typical puttingout system goods included spinning and weaving Merchant capitalists typically provided the raw materials paid workers by the piece and were responsible for the sale of the goods Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the puttingout system 5759 Some early spinning and weaving machinery such as a 40 spindle jenny for about six pounds in 1792 was affordable for cottagers 59 Later machinery such as spinning frames spinning mules and power looms were expensive especially if waterpowered giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories The majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were unmarried women and children including many orphans They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off It was common for women to take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work Lack of adequate transportation long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers The change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by Karl Marx however he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology Standards of living Some economists such as Robert Lucas Jr say that the real effect of the Industrial Revolution was that for the first time in history the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists even as a theoretical possibility Others argue that while the growth of the economys overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries and that in many ways workers living standards declined under early capitalism some studies have estimated that real wages in Britain only increased 15 between the 1780s and 1850s and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s The average height of the population declined during the Industrial Revolution implying that their nutritional status was also decreasing During the Industrial Revolution the life expectancy of children increased dramatically The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 745 in 17301749 to 318 in 18101829 The effects on living conditions have been controversial and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s Over the course of the period from 1813 to 1913 there was a significant increase in worker wages Food and nutrition Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norms for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France until the late 19th century Until about 1750 malnutrition limited life expectancy in France to about 35 years and about 40 years in Britain The United States population of the time was adequately fed much taller on average and had a life expectancy of 4550 years although US life expectancy declined by a few years by the mid 19th century Food consumption per capita also declined during an episode known as the Antebellum Puzzle Food supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the Corn Laws 18151846 which imposed tariffs on imported grain The laws were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers The Corn Laws were repealed in the early years of the Great Irish Famine The initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution such as mechanized textiles iron and coal did little if anything to lower food prices In Britain and the Netherlands food supply increased before the Industrial Revolution with better agricultural practices however population grew as well Housing The rapid population growth in the 19th century included the new industrial and manufacturing cities as well as service centers such as Edinburgh and London The critical factor was financing which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure P Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants People moved in so rapidly there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone so lowincome newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums Clean water sanitation and public health facilities were inadequate the death rate was high especially infant mortality and tuberculosis among young adults Cholera from polluted water and typhoid were endemic Unlike rural areas there were no famines such as the one that devastated Ireland in the 1840s A large expos literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions By far the most famous publication was by one of the founders of the socialist movement The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 Friedrich Engels describes backstreet sections of Manchester and other mill towns where people lived in crude shanties and shacks some not completely enclosed some with dirt floors These shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings There were no sanitary facilities The population density was extremely high However not everyone lived in such poor conditions The Industrial Revolution also created a middle class of businessmen clerks foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions Conditions improved over the course of the 19th century with new public health acts regulating things such as sewage hygiene and home construction In the introduction of his 1892 edition Engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved For example the Public Health Act 1875 38 39 Vict c 55 led to the more sanitary byelaw terraced house Water and sanitation Preindustrial water supply relied on gravity systems and pumping of water was done by water wheels Pipes were typically made of wood Steampowered pumps and iron pipes allowed the widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households Engels book describes how untreated sewage created awful odours and turned the rivers green in industrial cities In 1854 John Snow traced a cholera outbreak in Soho in London to fecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit Snows findings that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took some years to be accepted but his work led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems Literacy In the 18th century there were relatively high levels of literacy among farmers in England and Scotland This permitted the recruitment of literate craftsmen skilled workers foremen and managers who supervised the emerging textile factories and coal mines Much of the labour was unskilled and especially in textile mills children as young as eight proved useful in handling chores and adding to the family income Indeed children were taken out of school to work alongside their parents in the factories However by the mid19th century unskilled labor forces were common in Western Europe and British industry moved upscale needing many more engineers and skilled workers who could handle technical instructions and handle complex situations Literacy was essential to be hired A senior government official told Parliament in 1870 Upon the speedy provision of elementary education depends are industrial prosperity It is of no use trying to give technical teaching to our citizens without elementary education uneducated labourersand many of our labourers are utterly uneducatedare for the most part unskilled labourers and if we leave our workfolk any longer unskilled notwithstanding their strong sinews and determined energy they will become overmatched in the competition of the world The invention of the paper machine and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and pamphlet publishing which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation Clothing and consumer goods Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils and in the following decades stoves for cooking and space heating Coffee tea sugar tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in Europe The consumer revolution in England from the early 17th century to the mid18th century had seen a marked increase in the consumption and variety of luxury goods and products by individuals from different economic and social backgrounds With improvements in transport and manufacturing technology opportunities for buying and selling became faster and more efficient than previous The expanding textile trade in the north of England meant the threepiece suit became affordable to the masses Founded by potter and retail entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood in 1759 Wedgwood fine china and porcelain tableware was starting to become a common feature on dining tables Rising prosperity and social mobility in the 18th century increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption and the marketing of goods of which Wedgwood was a pioneer for individuals as opposed to items for the household started to appear and the new status of goods as status symbols related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal With the rapid growth of towns and cities shopping became an important part of everyday life Window shopping and the purchase of goods became a cultural activity in its own right and many exclusive shops were opened in elegant urban districts in the Strand and Piccadilly in London for example and in spa towns such as Bath and Harrogate Prosperity and expansion in manufacturing industries such as pottery and metalware increased consumer choice dramatically Where once labourers ate from metal platters with wooden implements ordinary workers now dined on Wedgwood porcelain Consumers came to demand an array of new household goods and furnishings metal knives and forks for example as well as rugs carpets mirrors cooking ranges pots pans watches clocks and a dizzying array of furniture The age of mass consumption had arrived New businesses in various industries appeared in towns and cities throughout Britain Confectionery was one such industry that saw rapid expansion According to food historian Polly Russell chocolate and biscuits became products for the masses thanks to the Industrial Revolution and the consumers it created By the mid19th century sweet biscuits were an affordable indulgence and business was booming Manufacturers such as Huntley Palmers in Reading Carrs of Carlisle and McVities in Edinburgh transformed from small familyrun businesses into stateoftheart operations In 1847 Frys of Bristol produced the first chocolate bar Their competitor Cadbury of Birmingham was the first to commercialize the association between confectionery and romance when they produced a heartshaped box of chocolates for Valentines Day in 1868 The department store became a common feature in major High Streets across Britain one of the first was opened in 1796 by Harding Howell Co on Pall Mall in London In the 1860s fish and chip shops emerged across the country in order to satisfy the needs of the growing industrial population In addition to goods being sold in the growing number of stores street sellers were common in an increasingly urbanized country Matthew White Crowds swarmed in every thoroughfare Scores of street sellers cried merchandise from place to place advertising the wealth of goods and services on offer Milkmaids orange sellers fishwives and piemen for example all walked the streets offering their various wares for sale while knife grinders and the menders of broken chairs and furniture could be found on street corners An early soft drinks company R Whites Lemonade began in 1845 by selling drinks in London in a wheelbarrow Increased literacy rates industrialisation and the invention of the railway created a new market for cheap popular literature for the masses and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale Penny dreadfuls were created in the 1830s to meet this demand The Guardian described penny dreadfuls as Britains first taste of massproduced popular culture for the young and the Victorian equivalent of video games By the 1860s and 1870s more than one million boys periodicals were sold per week Labelled an authorpreneur by The Paris Review Charles Dickens used innovations from the revolution to sell his books such as the new printing presses enhanced advertising revenues and the expansion of railroads His first novel The Pickwick Papers 1836 became a publishing phenomenon with its unprecedented success sparking numerous spinoffs and merchandise ranging from Pickwick cigars playing cards china figurines Sam Weller puzzles Weller boot polish and joke books Nicholas Dames in The Atlantic writes Literature is not a big enough category for Pickwick It defined its own a new one that we have learned to call entertainment In 1861 Welsh entrepreneur Pryce PryceJones formed the first mail order business an idea which would change the nature of retail Selling Welsh flannel he created mail order catalogues with customers able to order by mail for the first timethis following the Uniform Penny Post in 1840 and the invention of the postage stamp Penny Black where there was a charge of one penny for carriage and delivery between any two places in the United Kingdom irrespective of distanceand the goods were delivered throughout the UK via the newly created railway system As the railway network expanded overseas so did his business Population increase The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income According to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore the population of England and Wales which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740 rose dramatically after 1740 The population of England had more than doubled from 83 million in 1801 to 168 million in 1850 and by 1901 had nearly doubled again to 305 million Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 30 million in the 19th century Europes population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900 Urbanization The growth of the modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive urbanisation and the rise of new great cities first in Europe and then in other regions as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas In 1800 only 3 of the worlds population lived in cities compared to nearly 50 by the beginning of the 21st century Manchester had a population of 10000 in 1717 but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 23 million Effect on women and family life Womens historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women Taking a pessimistic side Alice Clark argues that when capitalism arrived in 17thcentury England it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance Clark argues that in 16thcentury England women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms and in some trades and landed estates Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands However Clark argues as capitalism expanded in the 17th century there was more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home and the wife was reduced to unpaid household work Middle and upperclass women were confined to an idle domestic existence supervising servants lowerclass women were forced to take poorly paid jobs Capitalism therefore had a negative effect on powerful women In a more positive interpretation Ivy Pinchbeck argues that capitalism created the conditions for womens emancipation Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women finding three stages in English history In the preindustrial era production was mostly for home use and women produced much of the needs of the households The second stage was the family wage economy of early industrialisation the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members including husband wife and older children The third or modern stage is the family consumer economy in which the family is the site of consumption and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption Ideas of thrift and hard work characterised middleclass families as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe These values were displayed in Samuel Smiles book SelfHelp in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was voluntary and selfimposedthe results of idleness thriftlessness intemperance and misconduct Labour conditions Social structure and working conditions In terms of social structure the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in mills and factories but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines As late as 1900 most industrial workers in the United States worked a 10hour day 12 hours in the steel industry yet earned 2040 less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life however most workers in textiles which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment were women and children For workers of the labouring classes industrial life was a stony desert which they had to make habitable by their own efforts Harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place Preindustrial society was very static and often cruelchild labour dirty living conditions and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution Factories and urbanisation Industrialisation led to the creation of the factory The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester nicknamed Cottonopolis and the worlds first industrial city Manchester experienced a sixtimes increase in its population between 1771 and 1831 Bradford grew by 50 every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50 of the population of Bradford were actually born there In addition between 1815 and 1939 20 of Europes population left home pushed by poverty a rapidly growing population and the displacement of peasant farming and artisan manufacturing They were pulled abroad by the enormous demand for labour overseas the ready availability of land and cheap transportation Still many did not find a satisfactory life in their new homes leading 7 million of them to return to Europe This mass migration had large demographic effects in 1800 less than 1 of the world population consisted of overseas Europeans and their descendants by 1930 they represented 11 The Americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration largely concentrated in the United States For much of the 19th century production was done in small mills which were typically waterpowered and built to serve local needs Later each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler In other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive Some industrialists tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers One of the earliest such reformers was Robert Owen known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the New Lanark mills and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the early socialist movement By 1746 an integrated brass mill was working at Warmley near Bristol Raw material went in at one end was smelted into brass and was turned into pans pins wire and other goods Housing was provided for workers on site Josiah Wedgwood and Matthew Boulton whose Soho Manufactory was completed in 1766 were other prominent early industrialists who employed the factory system Child labour The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution although infant mortality rates were reduced markedly There was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine and since the industrial system was new there were no experienced adult labourers This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries In England and Scotland in 1788 twothirds of the workers in 143 waterpowered cotton mills were described as children Child labour existed before the Industrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders 1020 of an adult males wage Reports were written detailing some of the abuses particularly in the coal mines and textile factories and these helped to popularise the childrens plight The public outcry especially among the upper and middle classes helped stir change in the young workers welfare Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid starvation and others simply welcomed the cheap labour In 1833 and 1844 the first general laws against child labour the Factory Acts were passed in Britain children younger than nine were not allowed to work children were not permitted to work at night and the workday of youth under age 18 was limited to twelve hours Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law however their scarcity made enforcement difficult About ten years later the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden Although laws such as these decreased the number of child labourers child labour remained significantly present in Europe and the United States until the 20th century Organisation of labour The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills factories and mines thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions to help advance the interests of working people The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production Skilled workers were difficult to replace and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining The main method the unions used to effect change was strike action Many strikes were painful events for both sides the unions and the management In Britain the Combination Act 1799 forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824 Even after this unions were still severely restricted One British newspaper in 1834 described unions as the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root under shelter of law in any country In 1832 the Reform Act extended the vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage That year six men from Tolpuddle in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s They refused to work for less than ten shillings per week although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings per week and were due to be further reduced to six In 1834 James Frampton a local landowner wrote to Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to complain about the union invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other which the members of the Friendly Society had done Six men were arrested found guilty and transported to Australia They became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs In the 1830s and 1840s the chartist movement was the first largescale organised workingclass political movement that campaigned for political equality and social justice Its Charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration Working people also formed friendly societies and cooperative societies as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship Enlightened industrialists such as Robert Owen supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike In 1842 a general strike involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain Eventually effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885 began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the British Labour Party Luddites The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs The movement started first with lace and hosiery workers near Nottingham and spread to other areas of the textile industry Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited and unskilled labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver Many such unemployed workers weavers and others turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery These attackers became known as Luddites supposedly followers of Ned Ludd a folklore figure The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811 The Luddites rapidly gained popularity and the British government took drastic measures using the militia or army to protect industry Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged or transported for life Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the Captain Swing disturbances Threshing machines were a particular target and hayrick burning was a popular activity However the riots led to the first formation of trade unions and further pressure for reform Shift in productions centre of gravity The traditional centres of hand textile production such as India parts of the Middle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machinemade textiles which over a period of decades destroyed the handmade textile industries and left millions of people without work many of whom starved The Industrial Revolution generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world as measured by the share of manufacturing output Cotton and the expansion of slavery Cheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton previously it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown with little raw cotton available for export Consequently prices of raw cotton rose British production grew from 2 million pounds in 1700 to 5 million pounds in 1781 to 56 million in 1800 The invention of the cotton gin by American Eli Whitney in 1792 was the decisive event It allowed greenseeded cotton to become profitable leading to the widespread growth of the large slave plantation in the United States Brazil and the West Indies In 1791 American cotton production was about 2 million pounds soaring to 35 million by 1800 half of which was exported Americas cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable and were able to keep up with demand The US Civil War created a cotton famine that led to increased production in other areas of the world including European colonies in Africa Effect on environment The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in coal consumption gave rise to an unprecedented level of air pollution in industrial centres after 1900 the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste The first largescale modern environmental laws came in the form of Britains Alkali Acts passed in 1863 to regulate the deleterious air pollution gaseous hydrochloric acid given off by the Leblanc process used to produce soda ash An alkali inspector and four subinspectors were appointed to curb this pollution The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted smoke grit dust and fumes under supervision The manufactured gas industry began in British cities in 18121820 The technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits They usually lost and modified the worst practices The City of London repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its fish Finally Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity The industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits In industrial cities local experts and reformers especially after 1890 took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution and initiating grassroots movements to demand and achieve reforms Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution The Coal Smoke Abatement Society was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental nongovernmental organisations It was founded by artist William Blake Richmond frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke Although there were earlier pieces of legislation the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions such as soot ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations Industrialisation beyond Great Britain Europe The Industrial Revolution in continental Europe came later than in Great Britain It started in Belgium and France then spread to the German states by the middle of the 19th century In many industries this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places Typically the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities By 1809 part of the Ruhr Valley in Westphalia was called Miniature England because of its similarities to the industrial areas of Britain Most European governments provided state funding to the new industries In some cases such as iron the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted AustriaHungary The Habsburg realms which became AustriaHungary in 1867 included 23 million inhabitants in 1800 growing to 36 million by 1870 Nationally the per capita rate of industrial growth averaged about 3 between 1818 and 1870 However there were strong regional differences The railway system was built in the 18501873 period Before they arrived transportation was very slow and expensive In the Alpine and Bohemian modernday Czech Republic regions protoindustrialisation began by 1750 and became the center of the first phases of the Industrial Revolution after 1800 The textile industry was the main factor utilising mechanisation steam engines and the factory system In the Czech lands the first mechanical loom followed in Varnsdorf in 1801 with the first steam engines appearing in Bohemia and Moravia just a few years later The textile production flourished particularly in Prague and Brno German Brnn which was considered the Moravian Manchester The Czech lands especially Bohemia became the centre of industrialisation due to its natural and human resources The iron industry had developed in the Alpine regions after 1750 with smaller centers in Bohemia and Moravia Hungarythe eastern half of the Dual Monarchy was heavily rural with little industry before 1870 In 1791 Prague organised the first Worlds FairList of worlds fairs Bohemia modernday Czech Republic The first industrial exhibition was on the occasion of the coronation of Leopold II as a king of Bohemia which took place in Clementinum and therefore celebrated the considerable sophistication of manufacturing methods in the Czech lands during that time period Technological change accelerated industrialisation and urbanisation The GNP per capita grew roughly 176 per year from 1870 to 1913 That level of growth compared very favourably to that of other European nations such as Britain 1 France 106 and Germany 151 However in a comparison with Germany and Britain the AustroHungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably as sustained modernisation had begun much later Belgium Belgium was the second country in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in continental Europe Wallonia Frenchspeaking southern Belgium took the lead Starting in the middle of the 1820s and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830 numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around Lige and Charleroi The leader was John Cockerill a transplanted Englishman His factories at Seraing integrated all stages of production from engineering to the supply of raw materials as early as 1825 Wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion Thanks to coal the French word houille was coined in Wallonia the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain But it is also pointed out by many researchers with its Sillon industriel Especially in the Haine Sambre and Meuse valleys between the Borinage and Ligethere was a huge industrial development based on coalmining and ironmaking Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830 It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old clothmaking town of Ghent Professor Michel De Coster stated The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world in proportion to its population and its territory But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coalmines the blast furnaces the iron and zinc factories the wool industry the glass industry the weapons industry were concentrated Many of the 19thcentury coal mines in Wallonia are now protected as World Heritage Sites Wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong socialist party and strong trade unions in a particular sociological landscape At the left the Sillon industriel which runs from Mons in the west to Verviers in the east except part of North Flanders in another period of the industrial revolution after 1920 Even if Belgium is the second industrial country after Britain the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different In Breaking stereotypes Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say The Industrial Revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium During the Middle Ages and the early modern period Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region Flanders with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 percent remained one of the most urbanised in the world By comparison this proportion reached only 17 percent in Wallonia barely 10 percent in most West European countries 16 percent in France and 25 percent in Britain Nineteenthcentury industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure except in Ghent Also in Wallonia the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process even though the proportion of citydwellers rose from 17 to 45 percent between 1831 and 1910 Especially in the Haine Sambre and Meuse valleys between the Borinage and Lige where there was a huge industrial development based on coalmining and ironmaking urbanisation was fast During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region Nevertheless industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal mine or a factory Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than for instance the area around Lige where the old town was there to direct migratory flows France The Industrial Revolution in France followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries Notably most French historians argue France did not go through a clear takeoff Instead Frances economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries However some stages were identified by Maurice LvyLeboyer French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars 17891815 industrialisation along with Britain 18151860 economic slowdown 18601905 renewal of the growth after 1905 Germany Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories Germany which was unified in 1871 became dominant in the worlds chemical industry in the late 19th century At first the production of dyes based on aniline was critical Germanys political disunitywith three dozen statesand a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s However by the 1840s trunk lines linked the major cities each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders Lacking a technological base at first the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways In many cities the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training so that by 1850 Germany was selfsufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry Observers found that even as late as 1890 their engineering was inferior to Britains However German unification in 1871 stimulated consolidation nationalisation into stateowned companies and further rapid growth Unlike the situation in France the goal was the support of industrialisation and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen By 1880 Germany had 9400 locomotives pulling 43000 passengers and 30000 tons of freight and pulled ahead of France Sweden During the period 17901815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates new crops and farming tools and commercialisation of farming and a proto industrialisation with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a consumption revolution starting in the 1820s Between 1815 and 1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in Bergslagen textile mills in Sjuhradsbygden and forestry in Norrland Several important institutional changes took place in this period such as free and mandatory schooling introduced in 1842 as the first country in the world the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846 and a stock company law in 1848 From 1850 to 1890 Sweden experienced its first Industrial Revolution with a veritable explosion in export dominated by crops wood and steel Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873 Large infrastructural investments were made during this period mainly in the expanding railroad network which was financed in part by the government and in part by private enterprises From 1890 to 1930 new industries developed with their focus on the domestic market mechanical engineering power utilities papermaking and textile Japan The Industrial Revolution began about 1870 as Meiji period leaders decided to catch up with the West The government built railroads improved roads and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development It inaugurated a new Westernbased education system for all young people sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe and hired more than 3000 Westerners to teach modern science mathematics technology and foreign languages in Japan Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan In 1871 a group of Japanese politicians known as the Iwakura Mission toured Europe and the United States to learn Western ways The result was a deliberate stateled industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up The Bank of Japan founded in 1882 used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the West Modern industry first appeared in textiles including cotton and especially silk which was based in home workshops in rural areas United States During the late 18th and early 19th centuries when the UK and parts of Western Europe began to industrialise the US was primarily an agricultural and natural resource producing and processing economy The building of roads and canals the introduction of steamboats and the building of railroads were important for handling agricultural and natural resource products in the large and sparsely populated country of the period Important American technological contributions during the period of the Industrial Revolution were the cotton gin and the development of a system for making interchangeable parts which was aided by the development of the milling machine in the United States The development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts was the basis for the rise of the US as the worlds leading industrial nation in the late 19th century Oliver Evans invented an automated flour mill in the mid1780s that used control mechanisms and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until the flour was discharged into a wagon This is considered to be the first modern materials handling system an important advance in the progress toward mass production The United States originally used horsepowered machinery for smallscale applications such as grain milling but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s As a result industrialisation was concentrated in New England and the Northeastern United States which has fastmoving rivers The newer waterpowered production lines proved more economical than horsedrawn production In the late 19th century steampowered manufacturing overtook waterpowered manufacturing allowing the industry to spread to the Midwest Thomas Somers and the Cabot Brothers founded the Beverly Cotton Manufactory in 1787 the first cotton mill in America the largest cotton mill of its era and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future This mill was designed to use horsepower but the operators quickly learned that the horsedrawn platform was economically unstable and had economic losses for years Despite the losses the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation both in turning a large amount of cotton but also developing the waterpowered milling structure used in Slaters Mill In 1793 Samuel Slater 17681835 founded the Slater Mill at Pawtucket Rhode Island He had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in Derbyshire England and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789 hoping to make money with his knowledge After founding Slaters Mill he went on to own 13 textile mills Daniel Day established a wool carding mill in the Blackstone Valley at Uxbridge Massachusetts in 1809 the third woollen mill established in the US The first was in Hartford Connecticut and the second at Watertown Massachusetts The John H Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor retraces the history of Americas HardestWorking River the Blackstone The Blackstone River and its tributaries which cover more than 70 kilometres 45 mi from Worcester Massachusetts to Providence Rhode Island was the birthplace of Americas Industrial Revolution At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley including Slaters Mill and with it the earliest beginnings of Americas industrial and technological development Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell from Newburyport Massachusetts memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810 Realising that the War of 1812 had ruined his import business but that demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America on his return to the United States he set up the Boston Manufacturing Company Lowell and his partners built Americas second cottontocloth textile mill at Waltham Massachusetts second to the Beverly Cotton Manufactory After his death in 1817 his associates built Americas first planned factory town which they named after him This enterprise was capitalised in a public stock offering one of the first uses of it in the United States Lowell Massachusetts using nine kilometres 512 miles of canals and 7500 kilowatts 10000 horsepower delivered by the Merrimack River is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution The shortlived utopialike WalthamLowell system was formed as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain However by 1850 especially following the Great Famine of Ireland the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour A major US contribution to industrialisation was the development of techniques to make interchangeable parts from metal Precision metal machining techniques were developed by the US Department of War to make interchangeable parts for small firearms The development work took place at the Federal Arsenals at Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory Techniques for precision machining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in the proper position jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy The milling machine a fundamental machine tool is believed to have been invented by Eli Whitney who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program Another important invention was the Blanchard lathe invented by Thomas Blanchard The Blanchard lathe or pattern tracing lathe was actually a shaper that could produce copies of wooden gun stocks The use of machinery and the techniques for producing standardised and interchangeable parts became known as the American system of manufacturing Precision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that mechanised the shoe industry and the watch industry The industrialisation of the watch industry started in 1854 also in Waltham Massachusetts at the Waltham Watch Company with the development of machine tools gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches Second Industrial Revolution Steel is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial massproduction which are said to characterise a Second Industrial Revolution beginning around 1850 although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the 1860s when Sir Henry Bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert molten pig iron into steel in large quantities However it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality Bessemer steel was being displaced by the open hearth furnace near the end of the 19th century This Second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include chemicals mainly the chemical industries petroleum refining and distribution and in the 20th century the automotive industry and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the United States and Germany The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation A new revolution began with electricity and electrification in the electrical industries The introduction of hydroelectric power generation in the Alps enabled the rapid industrialisation of coaldeprived northern Italy beginning in the 1890s By the 1890s industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests as companies like US Steel General Electric Standard Oil and Bayer AG joined the railroad and ship companies on the worlds stock markets New Industrialism The New Industrialist movement advocates for increasing domestic manufacturing while reducing emphasis on a financialbased economy that relies on real estate and trading speculative assets New Industrialism has been described as supplyside progressivism or embracing the idea of Building More Stuff New Industrialism developed after the China Shock that resulted in lost manufacturing jobs in the US after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 The movement strengthened after the reduction of manufacturing jobs during the Great Recession and when the US was not able to manufacture enough tests or facemasks during the COVID19 pandemic New Industrialism calls for building enough housing to satisfy demand in order to reduce the profit in land speculation to invest in infrastructure and to develop advanced technology to manufacture green energy for the world New Industrialists believe that the United States is not building enough productive capital and should invest more into economic growth Causes The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate Geographic factors include Britains vast mineral resources In addition to metal ores Britain had the highest quality coal reserves known at the time as well as abundant water power highly productive agriculture and numerous seaports and navigable waterways Some historians believe the Industrial Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the 17th century although feudalism began to break down after the Black Death of the mid 14th century followed by other epidemics until the population reached a low in the 14th century This created labour shortages and led to falling food prices and a peak in real wages around 1500 after which population growth began reducing wages After 1540 increasing precious metals supply from the Americas caused coinage debasement inflation which caused land rents often longterm leases that transferred to heirs on death to fall in real terms The Enclosure movement and the British Agricultural Revolution made food production more efficient and less labourintensive forcing the farmers who could no longer be selfsufficient in agriculture into cottage industry for example weaving and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories The colonial expansion of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are also cited as factors as is the scientific revolution of the 17th century A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth thereby encouraging economic development Until the 1980s it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine Marketing professor Ronald Fullerton suggested that innovative marketing techniques business practices and competition also influenced changes in the manufacturing industry Lewis Mumford has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the Early Middle Ages much earlier than most estimates He explains that the model for standardised mass production was the printing press and that the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock He also cites the monastic emphasis on order and timekeeping as well as the fact that medieval cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later more physical manifestations such as the steam engine The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain In other nations such as France markets were split up by local regions which often imposed tolls and tariffs on goods traded among them Internal tariffs were abolished by Henry VIII of England they survived in Russia until 1753 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain Governments grant of limited monopolies to inventors under a developing patent system the Statute of Monopolies in 1623 is considered an influential factor The effects of patents both good and ill on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine the key enabling technology In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development However monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance or even overbalance the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors Watts monopoly prevented other inventors such as Richard Trevithick William Murdoch or Jonathan Hornblower whom Boulton and Watt sued from introducing improved steam engines thereby retarding the spread of steam power Causes in Europe One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century particularly China India and the Middle East which pioneered in shipbuilding textile production water mills and much more in the period between 750 and 1100 or at other times like in Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages A recent account argued that Europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedomloving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early IndoEuropean invaders Many historians however have challenged this explanation as being not only Eurocentric but also ignoring historical context In fact before the Industrial Revolution there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy These historians have suggested a number of other factors including education technological changes see Scientific Revolution in Europe modern government modern work attitudes ecology and culture China was the worlds most technologically advanced country for many centuries however China stagnated economically and technologically and was surpassed by Western Europe before the Age of Discovery by which time China banned imports and denied entry to foreigners China was also a totalitarian society It also taxed transported goods heavily Modern estimates of per capita income in Western Europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1500 dollars in purchasing power parity and Britain had a per capita income of nearly 2000 dollars whereas China by comparison had only 450 dollars India was essentially feudal politically fragmented and not as economically advanced as Western Europe Historians such as David Landes and sociologists Max Weber and Rodney Stark credit the different belief systems in Asia and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of JudaeoChristianity and Greek thought Conversely Chinese society was founded on men like Confucius Mencius Han Feizi Legalism Lao Tzu Taoism and Buddha Buddhism resulting in very different worldviews Other factors include the considerable distance of Chinas coal deposits though large from its cities as well as the then unnavigable Yellow River that connects these deposits to the sea Economic historian Joel Mokyr argued that political fragmentation the presence of a large number of European states made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive as entrepreneurs innovators ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced large unitary empires such as China and India by providing an insurance against economic and technological stagnation China had both a printing press and movable type and India had similar levels of scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700 yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe not China or India In Europe political fragmentation was coupled with an integrated market for ideas where Europes intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin had a shared intellectual basis in Europes classical heritage and the panEuropean institution of the Republic of Letters Political institutions could contribute to the relation between democratization and economic growth during Great Divergence In addition Europes monarchs desperately needed revenue pushing them into alliances with their merchant classes Small groups of merchants were granted monopolies and taxcollecting responsibilities in exchange for payments to the state Located in a region at the hub of the largest and most varied network of exchange in history Europe advanced as the leader of the Industrial Revolution In the Americas Europeans found a windfall of silver timber fish and maize leading historian Peter Stearns to conclude that Europes Industrial Revolution stemmed in great part from Europes ability to draw disproportionately on world resources Modern capitalism originated in the Italian citystates around the end of the first millennium The citystates were prosperous cities that were independent from feudal lords They were largely republics whose governments were typically composed of merchants manufacturers members of guilds bankers and financiers The Italian citystates built a network of branch banks in leading western European cities and introduced double entry bookkeeping Italian commerce was supported by schools that taught numeracy in financial calculations through abacus schools Causes in Britain Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the Industrial Revolution Key factors fostering this environment were The period of peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland There were no internal trade barriers including between England and Scotland or feudal tolls and tariffs making Britain the largest coherent market in Europe 46 The rule of law enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts A straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of jointstock companies corporations Free market capitalism Geographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain were the fact that it had extensive coastlines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and Britain had the highest quality coal in Europe Britain also had a large number of sites for water power There were two main values that drove the Industrial Revolution in Britain These values were selfinterest and an entrepreneurial spirit Because of these interests many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a consumer revolution These advancements also greatly benefitted British society as a whole Countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own Industrial Revolutions A debate sparked by Trinidadian politician and historian Eric Williams in his work Capitalism and Slavery 1944 concerned the role of slavery in financing the Industrial Revolution Williams argued that European capital amassed from slavery was vital in the early years of the revolution contending that the rise of industrial capitalism was the driving force behind abolitionism instead of humanitarian motivations These arguments led to significant historiographical debates among historians with American historian Seymour Drescher critiquing Williams arguments in Econocide 1977 Instead the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies particularly China and Russia Britain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the Royal Navy Britains extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe This was further aided by Britains geographical positionan island separated from the rest of mainland Europe Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed It had a dense population for its small geographical size Enclosure of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the North of England the English Midlands South Wales and the Scottish Lowlands Local supplies of coal iron lead copper tin limestone and water power resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry Also the damp mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry The stable political situation in Britain from around 1689 following the Glorious Revolution and British societys greater receptiveness to change compared with other European countries can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism This point is also made in Hilaire Bellocs The Servile State The French philosopher Voltaire wrote about capitalism and religious tolerance in his book on English society Letters on the English 1733 noting why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the countrys less religiously tolerant European neighbours Take a view of the Royal Exchange in London a place more venerable than many courts of justice where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind There the Jew the Mahometan Muslim and the Christian transact together as though they all professed the same religion and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist and the Churchman depends on the Quakers word If one religion only were allowed in England the Government would very possibly become arbitrary if there were but two the people would cut one anothers throats but as there are such a multitude they all live happy and in peace Britains population grew 280 from 1550 to 1820 while the rest of Western Europe grew 5080 Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain from 1750 to 1800 By 1800 only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain This was only possible because coal coke imported cotton brick and slate had replaced wood charcoal flax peat and thatch The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horses work was mechanised A workhorse needs 12 to 20 ha 3 to 5 acres for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy In 1700 fivesixths of the coal mined worldwide was in Britain while the Netherlands had none so despite having Europes best transport lowest taxes and most urbanised wellpaid and literate population it failed to industrialise In the 18th century it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank Without coal Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s Based on science and experimentation from the continent the steam engine was developed specifically for pumping water out of mines many of which in Britain had been mined to below the water table Although extremely inefficient they were economical because they used unsaleable coal Iron rails were developed to transport coal which was a major economic sector in Britain Economic historian Robert Allen has argued that high wages cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies However two 2018 studies in The Economic History Review showed that wages were not particularly high in the British spinning sector or the construction sector casting doubt on Allens explanation A 2022 study in the Journal of Political Economy by Morgan Kelly Joel Mokyr and Cormac O Grada found that industrialization happened in areas with low wages and high mechanical skills whereas literacy banks and proximity to coal had little explanatory power Transfer of knowledge Knowledge of innovation was spread by several means Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached A common method was for someone to make a study tour gathering information where he could During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before all European countries and America engaged in studytouring some nations like Sweden and France even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy In other countries notably Britain and America this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods Study tours were common then as now as was the keeping of travel diaries Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies like the Lunar Society of Birmingham in which members met to discuss natural philosophy and often its application to manufacturing The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809 and it has been said of them They were if you like the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenthcentury revolutions the Industrial Revolution Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions For example the Londonbased Royal Society of Arts published an illustrated volume of new inventions as well as papers about them in its annual Transactions There were publications describing technology Encyclopaedias such as Harriss Lexicon Technicum 1704 and Abraham Reess Cyclopaedia 18021819 contain much of value Cyclopaedia contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution very well illustrated by fine engravings Foreign printed sources such as the Descriptions des Arts et Mtiers and Diderots Encyclopdie explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century and many regularly included notice of the latest patents Foreign periodicals such as the Annales des Mines published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours Protestant work ethic Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress technology and hard work The existence of this class is often linked to the Protestant work ethic see Max Weber and the particular status of the Baptists and the dissenting Protestant sects such as the Quakers and Presbyterians that had flourished with the English Civil War Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the national debt by the Bank of England contributed to the capacity for and interest in private financial investment in industrial ventures Dissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices as well as education at Englands only two universities at the time although dissenters were still free to study at Scotlands four universities When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official Anglican Church became mandatory due to the Test Act they thereupon became active in banking manufacturing and education The Unitarians in particular were very involved in education by running Dissenting Academies where in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important along with the nature of the national economies involved While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government they were considered fellow Protestants to a limited extent by many in the middle class such as traditional financiers or other businessmen Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century Criticisms The industrial revolution has been criticised for causing ecological collapse mental illness pollution and detrimental social systems It has also been criticised for valuing profits and corporate growth over life and wellbeing Multiple movements have arisen which reject aspects of the industrial revolution such as the Amish or primitivists Individualism humanism and harsh conditions Humanists and individualists criticise the Industrial revolution for mistreating women and children and turning men into work machines that lacked autonomy Critics of the Industrial revolution promoted a more interventionist state and formed new organisations to promote human rights Primitivism Primitivism argues that the Industrial Revolution have created an unnatural frame of society and the world in which humans need to adapt to an unnatural urban landscape in which humans are perpetual cogs without personal autonomy Certain primitivists argue for a return to preindustrial society while others argue that technology such as modern medicine and agriculture are all positive for humanity assuming they are controlled by and serve humanity and have no effect on the natural environment Pollution and ecological collapse The Industrial Revolution has been criticised for leading to immense ecological and habitat destruction It has led to immense decrease in the biodiversity of life on Earth The Industrial revolution has been said to be inherently unsustainable and will lead to eventual collapse of society mass hunger starvation and resource scarcity The Anthropocene The Anthropocene is a proposed epoch or mass extinction coming from humanity anthropo is the Greek root for humanity Since the start of the Industrial revolution humanity has permanently changed the Earth such as immense decrease in biodiversity and mass extinction caused by the Industrial revolution The effects include permanent changes to the Earths atmosphere and soil forests the mass destruction of the Industrial revolution has led to catastrophic impacts on the Earth Most organisms are unable to adapt leading to mass extinction with the remaining undergoing evolutionary rescue as a result of the Industrial revolution Permanent changes in the distribution of organisms from human influence will become identifiable in the geologic record Researchers have documented the movement of many species into regions formerly too cold for them often at rates faster than initially expected This has occurred in part as a result of changing climate but also in response to farming and fishing and to the accidental introduction of nonnative species to new areas through global travel The ecosystem of the entire Black Sea may have changed during the last 2000 years as a result of nutrient and silica input from eroding deforested lands along the Danube River Opposition from Romanticism During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed associated with the Romantic movement Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialisation urbanisation and the wretchedness of the working classes Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet William Blake and poets William Wordsworth Samuel Taylor Coleridge John Keats Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley The movement stressed the importance of nature in art and language in contrast to monstrous machines and factories the Dark satanic mills of Blakes poem And did those feet in ancient time Mary Shelleys Frankenstein reflected concerns that scientific progress might be twoedged French Romanticism likewise was highly critical of industry See also Footnotes References Further reading External links Internet Modern History Sourcebook

    title: "Cold War",
    originalContent:
      "The Cold War was a period of global geopolitical tension and struggle for ideological and economic influence between the United States and the Soviet Union USSR and their respective allies the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc that started in 1947 two years after the end of World War II and lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 The term cold war is used because there was no direct fighting between the two superpowers though each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts known as proxy wars Aside from the nuclear arms race starting in 1949 and conventional military deployment the struggle for dominance was expressed indirectly via psychological warfare propaganda campaigns espionage farreaching embargoes sports diplomacy and technological competitions such as the Space Race The US and USSR were both part of the Allies of World War II the military coalition which had defeated Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945 After the war the USSR installed satellite governments in the territories of Eastern and Central Europe it had occupied and promoted the spread of communism to North Korea in 1948 and created an alliance with the Peoples Republic of China in 1949 The US declared the Truman Doctrine of containment in 1947 as communistled uprisings led to the Greek Civil War and First Indochina War launched the Marshall Plan in 1948 to assist in Western Europes economic recovery and founded the NATO military alliance in 1949 which was matched by the Sovietled Warsaw Pact in 1955 The Berlin Blockade took place and Germanys occupation zones solidified into East and West Germany in 1949 The USSR tested its first nuclear weapon in August 1949 four years after the USs first test thus starting an arms race A major proxy war was the Korean War of 1950 to 1953 which ended in stalemate The Cuban Revolution of 1959 installed the first communist regime in the Western Hemisphere and in 1962 the Cuban Missile Crisis began after deployments of US missiles in Europe and Soviet missiles in Cuba it is considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into nuclear war Another major proxy conflict was the Vietnam War of 1955 to 1975 which ended in defeat for the US The USSR solidified its domination of Eastern Europe with the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 Both powers used economic aid in an attempt to win the loyalty of nonaligned countries such as India After the SinoSoviet split between the USSR and China in 1961 the US initiated contacts with China in 1972 In the same year the US and USSR signed a series of arms control treaties limiting their nuclear arsenals which eased tensions in a dtente In 1979 the toppling of proUS governments in Iran and Nicaragua and a Soviet invasion of Afghanistan again raised fears of war In 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev rose to leader of the USSR and expanded political freedoms in his country which led to the fall of the communist regimes of the Eastern Bloc in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 The Western Bloc included the US and a number of First World nations that were generally capitalist and liberal democratic but tied to a network of often authoritarian Third World states most of which were the European powers former colonies The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its communist party which had an influence across the Second World and was also tied to a network of authoritarian states The Soviet Union had a command economy and installed similarly communist regimes in its satellites United States involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anticommunist and rightwing dictatorships governments and uprisings across the world while Soviet involvement in regime change included the funding of leftwing parties wars of independence revolutions and dictatorships As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization and achieved independence in the period from 1945 to 1960 many became Third World battlefields in the Cold War Origins of the term At the end of World War II English writer George Orwell used cold war as a general term in his essay You and the Atomic Bomb published 19 October 1945 in the British newspaper Tribune Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear warfare Orwell looked at James Burnhams predictions of a polarized world writing Looking at the world as a whole the drift for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery James Burnhams theory has been much discussed but few people have yet considered its ideological implicationsthat is the kind of worldview the kind of beliefs and the social structure that would probably prevail in a state which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of cold war with its neighbours In The Observer of 10 March 1946 Orwell wrote after the Moscow conference last December Russia began to make a cold war on Britain and the British Empire The first use of the term to describe the specific postwar geopolitical confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States came in a speech by Bernard Baruch an influential advisor to Democratic presidents on 16 April 1947 The speech written by journalist Herbert Bayard Swope proclaimed Let us not be deceived we are today in the midst of a cold war Newspaper columnist Walter Lippmann gave the term wide currency with his book The Cold War When asked in 1947 about the source of the term Lippmann traced it to a French term from the 1930s la guerre froide Background and phases of the war The roots of the Cold War can be traced back to diplomatic and military tensions preceding World War II The 1917 Russian Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of BrestLitovsk where Soviet Russia ceded vast territories to Germany deepened distrust among the Western Allies Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War further complicated relations and although the Soviet Union later allied with Western powers to defeat Nazi Germany this cooperation was strained by mutual suspicions In the immediate aftermath of World War II disagreements about the future of Europe particularly Eastern Europe became central The Soviet Unions establishment of communist regimes in the countries it had liberated from Nazi controlenforced by the presence of the Red Armyalarmed the US and UK Western leaders saw this as a clear instance of Soviet expansionism clashing with their vision of a democratic Europe Economically the divide was sharpened with the introduction of the Marshall Plan in 1947 a US initiative to provide financial aid to rebuild Europe and prevent the spread of communism by stabilizing capitalist economies The Soviet Union rejected the Marshall Plan seeing it as an effort by the US to impose its influence on Europe In response the Soviet Union established Comecon Council for Mutual Economic Assistance to foster economic cooperation among communist states The United States and its Western European allies sought to strengthen their bonds and used the policy of containment against Soviet influence they accomplished this most notably through the formation of NATO which was essentially a defensive agreement in 1949 The Soviet Union countered with the Warsaw Pact in 1955 which had similar results with the Eastern Bloc As by that time the Soviet Union already had an armed presence and political domination all over its eastern satellite states the pact has been long considered superfluous Although nominally a defensive alliance the Warsaw Pacts primary function was to safeguard Soviet hegemony over its Eastern European satellites with the pacts only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away in the 1960s the pact evolved into a multilateral alliance in which the nonSoviet Warsaw Pact members gained significant scope to pursue their own interests In 1961 Sovietallied East Germany constructed the Berlin Wall to prevent the citizens of East Berlin from fleeing to West Berlin at the time part of United Statesallied West Germany Major crises of this phase included the Berlin Blockade of 19481949 the Chinese Communist Revolution of 19451949 the Korean War of 19501953 the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Suez Crisis of that same year the Berlin Crisis of 1961 the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and the Vietnam War of 19641975 Both superpowers competed for influence in Latin America and the Middle East and the decolonising states of Africa Asia and Oceania Following the Cuban Missile Crisis this phase of the Cold War saw the SinoSoviet split Between China and the Soviet Unions complicated relations within the Communist sphere leading to the SinoSoviet border conflict while France a Western Bloc state began to demand greater autonomy of action The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia occurred to suppress the Prague Spring of 1968 while the United States experienced internal turmoil from the civil rights movement and opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War In the 1960s1970s an international peace movement took root among citizens around the world Movements against nuclear weapons testing and for nuclear disarmament took place with large antiwar protests By the 1970s both sides had started making allowances for peace and security ushering in a period of dtente that saw the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the 1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China that opened relations with China as a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union A number of selfproclaimed MarxistLeninist governments were formed in the second half of the 1970s in developing countries including Angola Mozambique Ethiopia Cambodia Afghanistan and Nicaragua Dtente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the SovietAfghan War in 1979 Beginning in the 1980s this phase was another period of elevated tension The Reagan Doctrine led to increased diplomatic military and economic pressures on the Soviet Union which at the time was undergoing the Era of Stagnation This phase saw the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introducing the liberalizing reforms of glasnost openness and perestroika reorganization and ending Soviet involvement in Afghanistan in 1989 Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe and Gorbachev refused to further support the Communist governments militarily The fall of the Iron Curtain after the PanEuropean Picnic and the Revolutions of 1989 which represented a peaceful revolutionary wave with the exception of the Romanian revolution and the Afghan Civil War 19891992 overthrew almost all of the MarxistLeninist regimes of the Eastern Bloc The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the country and was banned following the 1991 Soviet coup attempt that August This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 and the collapse of Communist governments across much of Africa and Asia The Russian Federation became the Soviet Unions successor state while many of the other republics emerged from the Soviet Unions collapse as fully independent postSoviet states The United States was left as the worlds sole superpower Containment Truman Doctrine Korean War 194753 Iron Curtain Iran Trkiye Greece and Poland In February 1946 George F Kennans Long Telegram from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US governments increasingly hard line against the Soviets which would become the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War The telegram galvanized a policy debate that would eventually shape the Truman administrations Soviet policy Washingtons opposition to the Soviets accumulated after broken promises by Stalin and Molotov concerning Europe and Iran Following the World War II AngloSoviet invasion of Iran the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities However when this deadline came the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the Azerbaijan Peoples Government and Kurdish Republic of Mahabad Shortly thereafter on 5 March former British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous Iron Curtain speech in Fulton Missouri The speech called for an AngloAmerican alliance against the Soviets whom he accused of establishing an iron curtain dividing Europe from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic A week later on 13 March Stalin responded vigorously to the speech saying Churchill could be compared to Adolf Hitler insofar as he advocated the racial superiority of Englishspeaking nations so that they could satisfy their hunger for world domination and that such a declaration was a call for war on the USSR The Soviet leader also dismissed the accusation that the USSR was exerting increasing control over the countries lying in its sphere He argued that there was nothing surprising in the fact that the Soviet Union anxious for its future safety was trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the Soviet Union should exist in these countries Soviet territorial demands to Turkey regarding the Dardanelles in the Turkish Straits crisis and Black Sea border disputes were also a major factor in increasing tensions In September the Soviet side produced the Novikov telegram sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and coauthored by Vyacheslav Molotov it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war On 6 September 1946 James F Byrnes delivered a speech in Germany repudiating the Morgenthau Plan a proposal to partition and deindustrialize postwar Germany and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely As Byrnes stated a month later The nub of our program was to win the German people it was a battle between us and Russia over minds In December the Soviets agreed to withdraw from Iran after persistent US pressure an early success of containment policy By 1947 US president Harry S Truman was outraged by the perceived resistance of the Soviet Union to American demands in Iran Turkey and Greece as well as Soviet rejection of the Baruch Plan on nuclear weapons In February 1947 the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the Kingdom of Greece in its civil war against Communistled insurgents In the same month Stalin conducted the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election which constituted an open breach of the Yalta Agreement The US government responded to this announcement by adopting a policy of containment with the goal of stopping the spread of communism Truman delivered a speech calling for the allocation of 400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence even though Stalin had told the Communist Party to cooperate with the Britishbacked government Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War but ultimately persisted thereafter Moderate and conservative parties in Europe as well as social democrats gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance while European and American Communists financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations adhered to Moscows line although dissent began to appear after 1956 Other critiques of the consensus policy came from antiVietnam War activists the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the antinuclear movement Marshall Plan Czechoslovak coup and formation of two German states In early 1947 France Britain and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically selfsufficient Germany including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants goods and infrastructure already taken by the Soviets In June 1947 in accordance with the Truman Doctrine the United States enacted the Marshall Plan a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate including the Soviet Union Under the plan which President Harry S Truman signed on 3 April 1948 the US government gave to Western European countries over 13 billion equivalent to 189 billion in 2016 to rebuild the economy of Europe Later the program led to the creation of the OECD The plans aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to the European balance of power such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery One month later Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 creating a unified Department of Defense the Central Intelligence Agency CIA and the National Security Council NSC These would become the main bureaucracies for US defense policy in the Cold War Stalin believed economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control and that the US was trying to buy a proUS realignment of Europe Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid The Soviet Unions alternative to the Marshall Plan which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe became known as the Molotov Plan later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany his vision of a postwar Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union In early 1948 following reports of strengthening reactionary elements Czech Communists executed a coup dtat in Czechoslovakia resulting in the formation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic 9 May 1948 the only Eastern Bloc state that the Soviets had permitted to retain democratic structures The public brutality of the coup shocked Western powers more than any event up to that point set in motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress In an immediate aftermath of the crisis the London SixPower Conference was held resulting in the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council and its incapacitation an event marking the beginning of the fullblown Cold War and the end of its prelude as well as ending any hopes at the time for a single German government and leading to formation in 1949 of the Federal Republic of Germany and German Democratic Republic The twin policies of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe Greece and Turkey With the US assistance the Greek military won its civil war Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful CommunistSocialist alliance in the elections of 1948 Espionage All major powers engaged in espionage using a great variety of spies double agents moles and new technologies such as the tapping of telephone cables The Soviet KGB Committee for State Security the bureau responsible for foreign espionage and internal surveillance was famous for its effectiveness The most famous Soviet operation involved its atomic spies that delivered crucial information from the United States Manhattan Project leading the USSR to detonate its first nuclear weapon in 1949 four years after the American detonation and much sooner than expected A massive network of informants throughout the Soviet Union was used to monitor dissent from official Soviet politics and morals Although to an extent disinformation had always existed the term itself was invented and the strategy formalized by a black propaganda department of the Soviet KGB Based on the amount of topsecret Cold War archival information that has been released historian Raymond L Garthoff concludes there probably was parity in the quantity and quality of secret information obtained by each side However the Soviets probably had an advantage in terms of HUMINT human intelligence or interpersonal espionage and sometimes in its reach into high policy circles In terms of decisive impact however he concludes We also can now have high confidence in the judgment that there were no successful moles at the political decisionmaking level on either side Similarly there is no evidence on either side of any major political or military decision that was prematurely discovered through espionage and thwarted by the other side There also is no evidence of any major political or military decision that was crucially influenced much less generated by an agent of the other side According to historian Robert L Benson Washingtons forte was signals intelligence the procurement and analysis of coded foreign messages leading to the Venona project or Venona intercepts which monitored the communications of Soviet intelligence agents Moynihan wrote that the Venona project contained overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America complete with names dates places and deeds The Venona project was kept highly secret even from policymakers until the Moynihan Commission in 1995 Despite this the decryption project had already been betrayed and dispatched to the USSR by Kim Philby and Bill Weisband in 1946 as was discovered by the US by 1950 Nonetheless the Soviets had to keep their discovery of the program secret too and continued leaking their own information some of which was still useful to the American program According to Moynihan even President Truman may not have been fully informed of Venona which may have left him unaware of the extent of Soviet espionage Clandestine atomic spies from the Soviet Union who infiltrated the Manhattan Project at various points during WWII played a major role in increasing tensions that led to the Cold War In addition to usual espionage the Western agencies paid special attention to debriefing Eastern Bloc defectors Edward Jay Epstein describes that the CIA understood that the KGB used provocations or fake defections as a trick to embarrass Western intelligence and establish Soviet double agents As a result from 1959 to 1973 the CIA required that East Bloc defectors went through a counterintelligence investigation before being recruited as a source of intelligence During the late 1970s and 1980s the KGB perfected its use of espionage to sway and distort diplomacy Active measures were clandestine operations designed to further Soviet foreign policy goals consisting of disinformation forgeries leaks to foreign media and the channeling of aid to militant groups Retired KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin former head of Foreign Counter Intelligence for the KGB 19731979 described active measures as the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence During the SinoSoviet split spy wars also occurred between the USSR and PRC Cominform and the TitoStalin Split In September 1947 the Soviets created Cominform to impose orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June when the TitoStalin split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia which remained communist but adopted a nonaligned position and began accepting financial aid from the US Besides Berlin the status of the city of Trieste was at issue Until the break between Tito and Stalin the Western powers and the Eastern bloc faced each other uncompromisingly In addition to capitalism and communism Italians and Slovenes monarchists and republicans as well as war winners and losers often faced each other irreconcilably The neutral buffer state Free Territory of Trieste founded in 1947 with the United Nations was split up and dissolved in 1954 and 1975 also because of the dtente between the West and Tito Berlin Blockade The US and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into Bizone 1 January 1947 later Trizone with the addition of Frances zone April 1949 As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany in early 1948 representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system In addition in accordance with the Marshall Plan they began to reindustrialize and rebuild the West German economy including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany was undesirable with Walter Bedell Smith telling General Eisenhower in spite of our announced position we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to even though they seem to meet most of our requirements Shortly thereafter Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade June 1948 May 1949 one of the first major crises of the Cold War preventing Western food materials and supplies from arriving in the West Germanys exclave of West Berlin The United States primarily Britain France Canada Australia New Zealand and several other countries began the massive Berlin airlift supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions despite Soviet threats The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change Once again the East Berlin communists attempted to disrupt the Berlin municipal elections which were held on 5 December 1948 and produced a turnout of 86 and an overwhelming victory for the noncommunist parties The results effectively divided the city into East and West the latter comprising US British and French sectors 300000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue and US Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen created Operation Vittles which supplied candy to German children The Airlift was as much a logistical as a political and psychological success for the West it firmly linked West Berlin to the United States In May 1949 Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade In 1952 Stalin repeatedly proposed a plan to unify East and West Germany under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations if the new Germany were to stay out of Western military alliances but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal Beginnings of NATO and Radio Free Europe Britain France the United States Canada and eight other western European countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty of April 1949 establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO That August the first Soviet atomic device was detonated in Semipalatinsk Kazakh SSR Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948 the US Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949 The Soviet Union proclaimed its zone of occupation in Germany the German Democratic Republic that October Media in the Eastern Bloc was an organ of the state completely reliant on and subservient to the communist party Radio and television organizations were stateowned while print media was usually owned by political organizations mostly by the local communist party Soviet radio broadcasts used Marxist rhetoric to attack capitalism emphasizing themes of labor exploitation imperialism and warmongering Along with the broadcasts of the BBC and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe a major propaganda effort began in 1949 was Radio Free EuropeRadio Liberty dedicated to bringing about the peaceful demise of the communist system in the Eastern Bloc Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station an alternative to the controlled and partydominated domestic press in the Soviet Bloc Radio Free Europe was a product of some of the most prominent architects of Americas early Cold War strategy especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means such as George F Kennan Soviet and Eastern Bloc authorities used various methods to suppress Western broadcasts including radio jamming American policymakers including Kennan and John Foster Dulles acknowledged that the Cold War was in its essence a war of ideas The United States acting through the CIA funded a long list of projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world The CIA also covertly sponsored a domestic propaganda campaign called Crusade for Freedom German rearmament The rearmament of West Germany was achieved in the early 1950s Its main promoter was Konrad Adenauer the chancellor of West Germany with France the main opponent Washington had the decisive voice It was strongly supported by the Pentagon the US military leadership and weakly opposed by President Truman the State Department was ambivalent The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 changed the calculations and Washington now gave full support That also involved naming Dwight D Eisenhower in charge of NATO forces and sending more American troops to West Germany There was a strong promise that West Germany would not develop nuclear weapons Widespread fears of another rise of German militarism necessitated the new military to operate within an alliance framework under NATO command In 1955 Washington secured full German membership of NATO In May 1953 Lavrentiy Beria by then in a government post had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germanys incorporation into NATO but his attempts were cut short after he was executed several months later during a Soviet power struggle The events led to the establishment of the Bundeswehr the West German military in 1955 Chinese Civil War SEATO and NSC 68 In 1949 CCP Chairman Mao Zedongs Peoples Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kaisheks United Statesbacked Kuomintang KMT Nationalist Government in China The KMTcontrolled territory was now restricted to the island of Taiwan the nationalist government of which exists to this day The Kremlin promptly created an alliance with the newly formed Peoples Republic of China According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang KaiShek made and because in his search for a powerful centralized government Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China Moreover his party was weakened during the war against Japan Meanwhile the communists told different groups such as the peasants exactly what they wanted to hear and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism Confronted with the communist revolution in China and the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949 the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand its containment doctrine In NSC 68 a secret 1950 document the National Security Council proposed reinforcing proWestern alliance systems and quadrupling spending on defense Truman under the influence of advisor Paul Nitze saw containment as implying complete rollback of Soviet influence in all its forms United States officials moved to expand this version of containment into Asia Africa and Latin America in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements often led by communist parties financed by the USSR In this way this US would exercise preponderant power oppose neutrality and establish global hegemony In the early 1950s a period sometimes known as the Pactomania the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan a former WWII enemy South Korea Taiwan Australia New Zealand Thailand and the Philippines notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954 thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of longterm military bases Korean War One of the more significant examples of the implementation of containment was the United Nations USled intervention in the Korean War In June 1950 after years of mutual hostilities Kim Il Sungs North Korean Peoples Army invaded South Korea at the 38th parallel Stalin had been reluctant to support the invasion but ultimately sent advisers To Stalins surprise the United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 and 83 backed the defense of South Korea although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest of the fact that Taiwan Republic of China not the Peoples Republic of China held a permanent seat on the council A UN force of sixteen countries faced North Korea although 40 percent of troops were South Korean and about 50 percent were from the United States The US initially seemed to follow containment when it first entered the war This directed the USs action to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Koreas sovereignty while allowing North Koreas survival as a state However the success of the Inchon landing inspired the USUN forces to pursue a rollback strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea thereby allowing nationwide elections under UN auspices General Douglas MacArthur then advanced across the 38th Parallel into North Korea The Chinese fearful of a possible US invasion sent in a large army and defeated the UN forces pushing them back below the 38th parallel Truman publicly hinted that he might use his ace in the hole of the atomic bomb but Mao was unmoved The episode was used to support the wisdom of the containment doctrine as opposed to rollback The Communists were later pushed to roughly around the original border with minimal changes Among other effects the Korean War galvanised NATO to develop a military structure Public opinion in countries involved such as Great Britain was divided for and against the war After the Korean Armistice Agreement was approved in July 1953 North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized totalitarian dictatorship that accorded his family unlimited power while generating a pervasive cult of personality In the South the Americanbacked dictator Syngman Rhee ran an authoritarian regime that engaged in anticommunist mass killings While Rhee was overthrown in 1960 South Korea continued to be ruled by a military government of former Japanese collaborators until the reestablishment of a multiparty system in the late 1980s Subsequently South Korea experienced an economic boom and became one of the most advanced countries on the planet Nuclear Arms Race and escalation 195362 Khrushchev Eisenhower and deStalinization In 1953 changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War Dwight D Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January During the last 18 months of the Truman administration the American defense budget had quadrupled and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively Joseph Stalin died in 1953 Without a mutually agreeable successor the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by Georgy Malenkov This did not last however and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid1950s In 1956 he denounced Joseph Stalin and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society This was known as deStalinization On 18 November 1956 while addressing Western dignitaries at a reception in Moscows Polish embassy Khrushchev infamously declared Whether you like it or not history is on our side We will bury you shocking everyone present He would later claim he had not been referring to nuclear war but the historically fated victory of communism over capitalism In 1961 Khrushchev boasted that even if the Soviet Union was currently behind the West its housing shortage would disappear within ten years consumer goods would be made abundant and the construction of a communist society would be completed in the main within no more than two decades Eisenhowers secretary of state John Foster Dulles initiated a New Look for the containment strategy calling for a greater reliance on nuclear weapons against US enemies in wartime Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of massive retaliation threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression Possessing nuclear superiority for example allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 Suez Crisis The declassified US plans for retaliatory nuclear strikes in the late 1950s included the systematic destruction of 1200 major urban centers in the Soviet Bloc and China including Moscow East Berlin and Beijing In spite of these events there were substantial hopes for dtente when an upswing in diplomacy took place in 1959 including a twoweek visit by Khrushchev to the US and plans for a twopower summit for May 1960 The latter was disturbed by the U2 spy plane scandal however in which Eisenhower was caught lying about the intrusion of American surveillance aircraft into Soviet territory Warsaw Pact and Hungarian Revolution While Stalins death in 1953 slightly relaxed tensions the situation in Europe remained an uneasy armed truce The Soviets who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949 established a formal alliance therein the Warsaw Pact in 1955 It stood opposed to NATO The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 occurred shortly after Khrushchev arranged the removal of Hungarys Stalinist leader Mtys Rkosi In response to a popular anticommunist uprising the new regime formally disbanded the secret police declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to reestablish free elections The Soviet Army invaded Thousands of Hungarians were killed and arrested imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union and approximately 200000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials From 1957 through 1961 Khrushchev openly and repeatedly threatened the West with nuclear annihilation He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States capable of wiping out any American or European city According to John Lewis Gaddis Khrushchev rejected Stalins belief in the inevitability of war however The new leader declared his ultimate goal was peaceful coexistence In Khrushchevs formulation peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities which remained for decades until Gorbachevs later new thinking envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle The events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the communist parties of the world particularly in Western Europe with great decline in membership as many in both western and socialist countries felt disillusioned by the brutal Soviet response The communist parties in the West would never recover from the effect the Hungarian Revolution had on their membership a fact that was immediately recognized by some such as the Yugoslavian politician Milovan ilas who shortly after the revolution was crushed said that The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed Rapacki Plan and Berlin Crisis of 195859 In 1957 Polish foreign minister Adam Rapacki proposed the Rapacki Plan for a nuclear free zone in central Europe Public opinion tended to be favourable in the West but it was rejected by leaders of West Germany Britain France and the United States They feared it would leave the powerful conventional armies of the Warsaw Pact dominant over the weaker NATO armies During November 1958 Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent demilitarized free city He gave the United States Great Britain and France a sixmonth ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors of West Berlin or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans Khrushchev earlier explained to Mao Zedong that Berlin is the testicles of the West Every time I want to make the West scream I squeeze on Berlin NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in midDecember and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question American military buildup John F Kennedys foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union manifested by proxy contests Like Truman and Eisenhower Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism President Eisenhowers New Look policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks on all of the Soviet Union Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as flexible response This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals As part of this policy Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the US to counter Soviet influence without resorting to nuclear war To support his new strategy Kennedy ordered a massive increase in defense spending He sought and Congress provided a rapid buildup of the nuclear arsenal to restore the lost superiority over the Soviet Unionhe claimed in 1960 that Eisenhower had lost it because of excessive concern with budget deficits In his inaugural address Kennedy promised to bear any burden in the defense of liberty and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapons systems From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent as did the number of B52 bombers to deliver them The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424 He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles Kennedy also called on cities to construct fallout shelters Competition in the Third World Nationalist movements in some countries and regions notably Guatemala Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups or otherwise perceived to be unfriendly to Western interests In this context the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence The Kremlin saw continuing territorial losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology The United States used the Central Intelligence Agency CIA to undermine neutral or hostile Third World governments and to support allied ones In 1953 President Eisenhower implemented Operation Ajax a covert coup operation to overthrow the Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh The popularly elected Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the Britishowned AngloIranian Oil Company in 1951 Winston Churchill told the United States that Mosaddegh was increasingly turning towards Communist influence The proWestern shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi assumed control as an autocratic monarch The shahs policies included banning the communist Tudeh Party of Iran and general suppression of political dissent by SAVAK the shahs domestic security and intelligence agency In Guatemala a banana republic the 1954 Guatemalan coup dtat ousted the leftwing President Jacobo rbenz with material CIA support The postArbenz governmenta military junta headed by Carlos Castillo Armasrepealed a progressive land reform law returned nationalized property belonging to the United Fruit Company set up a National Committee of Defense Against Communism and decreed a Preventive Penal Law Against Communism at the request of the United States The nonaligned Indonesian government of Sukarno was faced with a major threat to its legitimacy beginning in 1956 when several regional commanders began to demand autonomy from Jakarta After mediation failed Sukarno took action to remove the dissident commanders In February 1958 dissident military commanders in Central Sumatra Colonel Ahmad Husein and North Sulawesi Colonel Ventje Sumual declared the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of IndonesiaPermesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist Partai Komunis Indonesia Due to their anticommunist rhetoric the rebels received arms funding and other covert aid from the CIA until Allen Lawrence Pope an American pilot was shot down after a bombing raid on governmentheld Ambon in April 1958 The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds at Padang and Manado By the end of 1958 the rebels were militarily defeated and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered by August 1961 In the Republic of the Congo also known as CongoLopoldville newly independent from Belgium since June 1960 the Congo Crisis erupted on 5 July leading to the secession of the regions Katanga and South Kasai CIAbacked President Joseph KasaVubu ordered the dismissal of the democratically elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the Lumumba cabinet in September over massacres by the armed forces during the invasion of South Kasai and for involving Soviets in the country Later the CIAbacked Colonel Mobutu Sese Seko quickly mobilized his forces to seize power through a military coup dtat and worked with Western intelligence agencies to imprison Lumumba and hand him over to Katangan authorities who executed him by firing squad In British Guiana the leftist Peoples Progressive Party PPP candidate Cheddi Jagan won the position of chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953 but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britains suspension of the stilldependent nations constitution Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagans allegedly Marxist party the British imprisoned the PPPs leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955 engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961 despite Britains shift to a reconsideration of its view of the leftwing Jagan as a Sovietstyle communist at this time The United States pressured the British to withhold Guyanas independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified supported and brought into office Worn down by the communist guerrilla war for Vietnamese independence and handed a watershed defeat by communist Viet Minh rebels at the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu the French accepted a negotiated abandonment of their colonial stake in Vietnam In the Geneva Conference peace accords were signed leaving Vietnam divided between a proSoviet administration in North Vietnam and a proWestern administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north Between 1954 and 1961 Eisenhowers United States sent economic aid and military advisers to strengthen South Vietnams proWestern government against communist efforts to destabilize it Many emerging nations of Asia Africa and Latin America rejected the pressure to choose sides in the EastWest competition In 1955 at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgradeheadquartered NonAligned Movement in 1961 Meanwhile Khrushchev broadened Moscows policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states Independence movements in the Third World transformed the postwar order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America SinoSoviet split After 1956 the SinoSoviet alliance began to break down Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956 and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge For his part Khrushchev disturbed by Maos glib attitude toward nuclear war referred to the Chinese leader as a lunatic on a throne After this Khrushchev made many desperate attempts to reconstitute the SinoSoviet alliance but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal The ChineseSoviet animosity spilled out in an intracommunist propaganda war Further on the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Maos China for leadership of the global communist movement Historian Lorenz M Lthi argues The SinoSoviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall the Cuban Missile Crisis the Second Vietnam War and SinoAmerican rapprochement The split helped to determine the framework for the Cold War period 19791985 in general and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular Space Race On the nuclear weapons front the United States and the Soviet Union pursued nuclear rearmament and developed longrange weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other In August 1957 the Soviets successfully launched the worlds first intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM and in October they launched the first Earth satellite Sputnik 1 This led to what became known as the Sputnik crisis The Central Intelligence Agency described the orbit of Sputnik 1 as a stupendous scientific achievement and concluded that the USSR had likely perfected an intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM capable of reaching any desired target with accuracy The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the Space Race This led to a series of historic space exploration milestones and most notably the Apollo Moon landings from 1969 by the United States which astronaut Frank Borman later described as just a battle in the Cold War The publics reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing which affected the reaction A portion of the populace did not give it any attention and another portion was angered by it A major Cold War element of the Space Race was satellite reconnaissance as well as signals intelligence to gauge which aspects of the space programs had military capabilities The Soviet Salyut programme conducted in the 1970s and 80s put a manned space station in long term orbit two of the successful installations to the station were covers for secret military Almaz reconnaissance stations Salyut 3 and Salyut 5 During the whole duration of the cold war the US and the USSR represented the largest and dominant space powers of the world Despite their fierce competition both nations signed international space treaties in the 1960s which would limit the militarization of space The first research of antisatellite weapon technology also came about during this period Later the US and USSR pursued some cooperation in space as part of dtente notably the ApolloSoyuz orbital rendezvous and docking Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution In Cuba the 26th of July Movement led by young revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara seized power in the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959 toppling President Fulgencio Batista whose unpopular regime had been denied arms by the Eisenhower administration Although Fidel Castros first refused to categorize his new government as socialist and repeatedly denying being a communist Castro appointed Marxists to senior government and military positions Most significantly Che Guevara became Governor of the Central Bank and then Minister of Industries Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States continued for some time after Batistas fall but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Castro during the latters trip to Washington DC in April leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place Cuba began negotiating for arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960 The same month Eisenhower gave approval to CIA plans and funding to overthrow Castro In January 1961 just prior to leaving office Eisenhower formally severed relations with the Cuban government That April the administration of newly elected American President John F Kennedy mounted the unsuccessful CIAorganized shipborne invasion of the island by Cuban exiles at Playa Girn and Playa Larga in Santa Clara Provincea failure that publicly humiliated the United States Castro responded by publicly embracing MarxismLeninism and the Soviet Union pledged to provide further support In December the US government began a violent campaign of terrorist attacks against civilians in Cuba and covert operations and sabotage against the administration in an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government Berlin Crisis of 1961 The Berlin Crisis of 1961 was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and postWorld War II Germany By the early 1950s the Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc However hundreds of thousands of East Germans annually emigrated to free and prosperous West Germany through a loophole in the system that existed between East Berlin and West Berlin The emigration resulted in a massive brain drain from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals such that nearly 20 of East Germanys population had migrated to West Germany by 1961 That June the Soviet Union issued a new ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Allied forces from West Berlin The request was rebuffed but the United States now limited its security guarantees to West Berlin On 13 August East Germany erected a barbedwire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the Berlin Wall effectively closing the loophole and preventing its citizens from fleeing to the West Cuban Missile Crisis and Khrushchevs ousting The Kennedy administration continued seeking ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs invasion experimenting with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government Significant hopes were pinned on the program of terrorist attacks and other destabilization operations known as Operation Mongoose that was devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961 Khrushchev learned of the project in February 1962 and preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response Alarmed Kennedy considered various reactions He ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade and he presented an ultimatum to the Soviets Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for a public American pledge not to invade Cuba again as well as a covert deal to remove US missiles from Turkey Castro later admitted that I would have agreed to the use of nuclear weapons we took it for granted that it would become a nuclear war anyway and that we were going to disappear The Cuban Missile Crisis OctoberNovember 1962 brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before The aftermath led to efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations although the Cold Wars first arms control agreement the Antarctic Treaty had come into force in 1961 The compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started In 1964 Khrushchevs Kremlin colleagues managed to oust him but allowed him a peaceful retirement He was accused of rudeness and incompetence and John Lewis Gaddis argues that he was also blamed with ruining Soviet agriculture bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war and becoming an international embarrassment when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall According to Dobrynin the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation From confrontation to dtente 196279 In the course of the 1960s and 1970s Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs From the beginning of the postwar period with American help Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated The Vietnam War descended into a quagmire for the United States leading to a decline in international prestige and economic stability derailing arms agreements and provoking domestic unrest Americas withdrawal from the war led it to embrace a policy of dtente with both China and the Soviet Union In the 1973 oil crisis Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC cut their petroleum output This raised oil prices and hurt Western economies but helped the Soviet Union by generating a huge flow of money from its oil sales As a result of the oil crisis combined with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as OPEC and the NonAligned Movement less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower Meanwhile Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Unions deepseated domestic economic problems During this period Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of dtente Vietnam War Under President John F Kennedy US troop levels in Vietnam grew under the Military Assistance Advisory Group program from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16000 in 1963 South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diems heavyhanded crackdown on Buddhist monks in 1963 led the US to endorse a deadly military coup against Diem The war escalated further in 1964 following the controversial Gulf of Tonkin incident in which a US destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave President Lyndon B Johnson broad authorization to increase US military presence deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184000 Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev responded by reversing Khrushchevs policy of disengagement and increasing aid to the North Vietnamese hoping to entice the North from its proChinese position The USSR discouraged further escalation of the war however providing just enough military assistance to tie up American forces From this point the Peoples Army of Vietnam PAVN also known as the North Vietnamese Army NVA engaged in more conventional warfare with US and South Vietnamese forces The Tet Offensive of 1968 proved to be the turning point of the war Despite years of American tutelage and aid the South Vietnamese forces were unable to withstand the communist offensive and the task fell to US forces instead Tet showed that the end of US involvement was not in sight increasing domestic skepticism of the war and giving rise to what was referred to as the Vietnam syndrome a public aversion to American overseas military involvements Nonetheless operations continued to cross international boundaries bordering areas of Laos and Cambodia were used by North Vietnam as supply routes and were heavily bombed by US forces At the same time in 19631965 American domestic politics saw the triumph of liberalism According to historian Joseph Crespino It has become a staple of twentiethcentury historiography that Cold War concerns were at the root of a number of progressive political accomplishments in the postwar period a high progressive marginal tax rate that helped fund the arms race and contributed to broad income equality bipartisan support for farreaching civil rights legislation that transformed politics and society in the American South which had long given the lie to Americas egalitarian ethos bipartisan support for overturning an explicitly racist immigration system that had been in place since the 1920s and free health care for the elderly and the poor a partial fulfillment of one of the unaccomplished goals of the New Deal era The list could go on Nuclear testing and Use of OuterSpace treaties The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed on August 5 1963 by the United States the Soviet Union the United Kingdom and over 100 other nations This treaty banned nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere outer space and underwater restricting such tests to underground environments The treaty followed heightened concerns over the militarization of space amplified by the United States Starfish Prime test in 1962 which involved the detonation of a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere This event generated significant electromagnetic effects and illuminated the potential for spacebased weaponry prompting international calls for regulation To further delineate the peaceful use of outer space the United Nations facilitated the drafting of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies commonly known as the Outer Space Treaty Signed on January 27 1967 by the United States the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom it entered into force on October 10 1967 The treaty established space as a domain to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies Invasion of Czechoslovakia In 1968 a period of political liberalization took place in Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring An Action Program of reforms included increasing freedom of the press freedom of speech and freedom of movement along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods the possibility of a multiparty government limitations on the power of the secret police and potential withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact In answer to the Prague Spring on 20 August 1968 the Soviet Army together with most of their Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration including an estimated 70000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing with the total eventually reaching 300000 The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia Romania China and from Western European countries SinoSoviet split and NixonChina visit As a result of the SinoSoviet split tensions along the ChineseSoviet border reached their peak in 1969 United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War through a policy of rapproachment with China which began with his 1972 visit to China and culminated in 1979 with the signing of the Joint Communiqu on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations by President Carter and Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping Nixon Brezhnev and dtente Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s tensions were beginning to ease Following the ousting of Khrushchev another period of collective leadership ensued consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader Following his visit to China Nixon met with Soviet leaders in Moscow These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in landmark arms control treaties These aimed to limit the development of costly antiballistic missiles and nuclear missiles Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence and established the groundbreaking new policy of dtente or cooperation between the superpowers Meanwhile Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures The Soviet Unions military budget in the 1970s was massive 4060 of the federal budget and 15 of GDP Between 1972 and 1974 the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties including agreements for increased trade As a result of their meetings dtente would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually These developments coincided with Bonns Ostpolitik policy formulated by the West German Chancellor Willy Brandt an effort to normalize relations between West Germany and Eastern Europe Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe culminating in the Helsinki Accords signed at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1975 The Helsinki Accords in which the Soviets promised to grant free elections in Europe has been called a major concession to ensure peace by the Soviets In practice the Soviet government significantly curbed the rule of law civil liberties protection of law and guarantees of property which were considered examples of bourgeois morality by Soviet legal theorists such as Andrey Vyshinsky The Soviet Union signed legallybinding human rights documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1973 and the Helsinki Accords in 1975 but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities Human rights activists in the Soviet Union were regularly subjected to harassment repressions and arrests The proSoviet American business magnate Armand Hammer of Occidental Petroleum often mediated trade relations Author Daniel Yergin in his book The Prize writes that Hammer ended up as a gobetween for five Soviet General Secretaries and seven US Presidents Hammer had extensive business relationship in the Soviet Union stretching back to the 1920s with Lenins approval According to Christian Science Monitor in 1980 although his business dealings with the Soviet Union were cut short when Stalin came to power he had more or less singlehandedly laid the groundwork for the 1980 state of Western trade with the Soviet Union In 1974 Brezhnev publicly recognized Hammers role in facilitating EastWest trade By 1981 according to the New York Times in that year Hammer was on a firstname basis with Leonid Brezhnev Kissinger and Nixon were realists who deemphasized idealistic goals like anticommunism or promotion of democracy worldwide because those goals were too expensive in terms of Americas economic capabilities Instead of a Cold War they wanted peace trade and cultural exchanges They realized that Americans were no longer willing to tax themselves for idealistic foreign policy goals especially for containment policies that never seemed to produce positive results Instead Nixon and Kissinger sought to downsize Americas global commitments in proportion to its reduced economic moral and political power They rejected idealism as impractical and too expensive and neither man showed much sensitivity to the plight of people living under Communism Kissingers realism fell out of fashion as idealism returned to American foreign policy with Carters moralism emphasizing human rights and Reagans rollback strategy aimed at destroying Communism Late 1970s deterioration of relations In the 1970s the KGB led by Yuri Andropov continued to persecute distinguished Soviet dissidents such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of dtente in the Third World particularly during political crises in the Middle East Chile Ethiopia and Angola In 1973 Nixon announced his administration was committed to seeking most favored nation trade status with the USSR which was challenged by Congress in the JacksonVanik Amendment The United States had long linked trade with the Soviet Union to its foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and especially since the early 1980s to Soviet human rights policies The JacksonVanik Amendment which was attached to the 1974 Trade Act linked the granting of mostfavorednation to the USSR to the right of persecuted Soviet Jews to emigrate Because the Soviet Union refused the right of emigration to Jewish refuseniks the ability of the President to apply mostfavored nation trade status to the Soviet Union was restricted Although President Jimmy Carter tried to place another limit on the arms race with a SALT II agreement in 1979 his efforts were undermined by the other events that year including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution which both ousted proUS governments and his retaliation against the Soviet coup in Afghanistan in December Renewal of tensions 197985 The period in the late 1970s and early 1980s showed an intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant Diggins says Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world Cox says The intensity of this second Cold War was as great as its duration was short Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and end of dtente In April 1978 the communist Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan PDPA seized power in Afghanistan in the Saur Revolution Within months opponents of the communist regime launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide The Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring Pakistan and China while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government Meanwhile increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPAthe dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parchamresulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup By mid1979 the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen In September 1979 Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin who assumed the presidency Distrusted by the Soviets Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces during Operation Storm333 in December 1979 Afghan forces suffered losses during the Soviet operation 30 Afghan palace guards and over 300 army guards were killed while another 150 were captured Two of Amins sons an 11yearold and a 9yearold died from shrapnel wounds sustained during the clashes In the aftermath of the operation a total of 1700 Afghan soldiers who surrendered to Soviet forces were taken as prisoners and the Soviets installed Babrak Karmal the leader of the PDPAs Parcham faction as Amins successor Veterans of the Soviet Unions Alpha Group have stated that Operation Storm333 was one of the most successful in the units history Documents released following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s revealed that the Soviet leadership believed Amin had secret contacts within the American embassy in Kabul and was capable of reaching an agreement with the United States however allegations of Amin colluding with the Americans have been widely discredited The PDBA was tasked to fill the vacuum and carried out a purge of Amin supporters Soviet troops were deployed to put Afghanistan under Soviet control with Karmal in more substantial numbers although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan As a result however the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan Carter responded to the Soviet invasion by withdrawing the SALT II treaty from ratification imposing embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR and demanding a significant increase in military spending and further announced the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow which was joined by 65 other nations He described the Soviet incursion as the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War Reagan and Thatcher In January 1977 four years prior to becoming president Ronald Reagan bluntly stated in a conversation with Richard V Allen his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple and some would say simplistic he said It is this We win and they lose What do you think of that In 1980 Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an evil empire and predicted that Communism would be left on the ash heap of history while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as bent on world dominance In 1982 Reagan tried to cut off Moscows access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe It hurt the Soviet economy but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue Reagan retreated on this issue By early 1985 Reagans anticommunist position had developed into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrinewhich in addition to containment formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments Besides continuing Carters policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Sovietbacked PDPA government in Afghanistan the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majorityMuslim Central Asian Soviet Union Additionally the CIA encouraged anticommunist Pakistans ISI to train Muslims from around the world to participate in the jihad against the Soviet Union Polish Solidarity movement and martial law Pope John Paul II provided a moral focus for anticommunism a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement trade union that galvanized opposition and may have led to his attempted assassination two years later In December 1981 Polands Wojciech Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response Mikhail Suslov the Kremlins top ideologist advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions resulting in a catastrophe for the Soviet economy US and USSR military and economic issues The Soviet Union had built up a military that consumed as much as 25 percent of its gross national product at the expense of consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deepseated structural problems in the Soviet system which experienced at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity but in large part by the interests of the nomenklatura which was dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed in the number of troops in their ranks and in the sheer size of their militaryindustrial base However the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West For example the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet Unions most common main battle tank the T72 were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T72s as the US deployed M1s By the early 1980s the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan President Carter began massively building up the United States military This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration which increased the military spending from 53 percent of GNP in 1981 to 65 percent in 1986 the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history The AmericanSoviet tensions present during 1983 was defined by some as the start of Cold War II While in retrospective this phase of the Cold War was generally defined as a war of words the Soviets peace offensive was largely rejected by the West Tensions continued to intensify as Reagan revived the B1 Lancer program which had been canceled by the Carter administration produced LGM118 Peacekeeper missiles installed US cruise missiles in Europe and announced the experimental Strategic Defense Initiative dubbed Star Wars by the media a defense program to shoot down missiles in midflight The Soviets deployed RSD10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe and NATO decided under the impetus of the Carter presidency to deploy MGM31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe primarily West Germany This deployment placed missiles just 10 minutes striking distance from Moscow After Reagans military buildup the Soviet Union did not respond by further building its military because the enormous military expenses along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy At the same time Saudi Arabia increased oil production even as other nonOPEC nations were increasing production These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut which affected the Soviet Union as oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues Issues with command economics oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation On 1 September 1983 the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 a Boeing 747 with 269 people aboard including sitting Congressman Larry McDonald an action which Reagan characterized as a massacre The airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul but owing to a navigational mistake made by the crew it drifted from its original planned route and flew through Russian prohibited airspace past the west coast of Sakhalin Island near Moneron Island The Soviet Air Force treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding US spy plane and destroyed it with airtoair missiles The Soviet Union found the wreckage under the sea two weeks later on 15 September and found the flight recorders in October but this information was kept secret by the Soviet authorities until after the countrys collapse The incident increased support for military deployment overseen by Reagan which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev During the early hours of 26 September 1983 the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident occurred systems in Serpukhov15 underwent a glitch that claimed several intercontinental ballistic missiles were heading towards Russia but officer Stanislav Petrov correctly suspected it was a false alarm ensuring the Soviets did not respond to the nonexistent attack As such he has been credited as the man who saved the world The Able Archer 83 exercise in November 1983 a realistic simulation of a coordinated NATO nuclear release was perhaps the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis as the Soviet leadership feared that a nuclear attack might be imminent American domestic public concerns about intervening in foreign conflicts persisted from the end of the Vietnam War The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick lowcost counterinsurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts In 1983 the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War invaded Grenada bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras anticommunist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Sovietaligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua While Reagans interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy The Reagan administrations backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War in particular the regime of Efran Ros Montt was also controversial Meanwhile the Soviets incurred high costs for their own foreign interventions Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the Soviet war in Afghanistan would be brief Muslim guerrillas aided by the US China Britain Saudi Arabia and Pakistan waged a fierce resistance against the invasion The Kremlin sent nearly 100000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan leading many outside observers to dub the war the Soviets Vietnam However Moscows quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system A senior US State Department official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980 positing that the invasion resulted in part from a domestic crisis within the Soviet system It may be that the thermodynamic law of entropy has caught up with the Soviet system which now seems to expend more energy on simply maintaining its equilibrium than on improving itself We could be seeing a period of foreign movement at a time of internal decay Final years 19851991 Gorbachevs reforms By the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985 the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called perestroika or restructuring Perestroika relaxed the production quota system allowed cooperative ownership of small businesses and paved the way for foreign investment These measures were intended to redirect the countrys resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector Despite initial skepticism in the West the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Unions deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost or openness which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the Western world particularly with the United States contributing to the accelerating dtente between the two nations Thaw in relations In response to the Kremlins military and political concessions Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scalingback of the arms race The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva Switzerland A second summit was held in October 1986 in Reykjavk Iceland Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagans proposed Strategic Defense Initiative SDI which Gorbachev wanted to be eliminated Reagan refused The negotiations failed but the third summit Washington Summit 1987 810 December 1987 led to a breakthrough with the signing of the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces Treaty INF The INF treaty eliminated all nucleararmed groundlaunched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5500 kilometers 310 and 3420 mi and their infrastructure During 1988 it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies along with the cost of maintaining massive troops levels represented a substantial economic drain In addition the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe George H W Bush and Gorbachev met at the Moscow Summit in May 1988 and the Governors Island Summit in December 1988 In 1989 Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan without achieving their objectives Later that year the Berlin Wall the Inner German border and the Iron Curtain fell On 3 December 1989 Gorbachev and Bush declared the Cold War over at the Malta Summit In February 1990 Gorbachev agreed with the USproposed Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany and signed it on 12 September 1990 paving the way for the German reunification When the Berlin Wall came down Gorbachevs Common European Home concept began to take shape The two former adversaries were partners in the Gulf War against Iraq August 1990 February 1991 During the final summit in Moscow in July 1991 Gorbachev and Bush signed the START I arms control treaty Eastern Europe breaks away Two developments dominated the decade that followed the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Unions economic and political structures and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process Kenneth S Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil and resulted in the depletion of the countrys hard currency reserves Brezhnevs next two successors transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition did not last long Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power both died in less than two years In an attempt to avoid a third shortlived leader in 1985 the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership called perestroika His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War In 1988 the USSR abandoned its war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces In the following year Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states which paved the way for the Revolutions of 1989 In particular the standstill of the Soviet Union at the PanEuropean Picnic in August 1989 then set a peaceful chain reaction in motion at the end of which the Eastern Bloc collapsed With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East and West Germany pursuing reunification the Iron Curtain between the West and Sovietoccupied regions came down By 1989 the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse and deprived of Soviet military support the communist leaders of the Warsaw Pact states were losing power Grassroots organizations such as Polands Solidarity movement rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases The PanEuropean Picnic in August 1989 in Hungary finally started a peaceful movement that the rulers in the Eastern Bloc could not stop It was the largest movement of refugees from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 and ultimately brought about the fall of the Iron Curtain The patrons of the picnic Otto von Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachevs reaction The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union which was then headed by Karl von Habsburg distributed thousands of brochures inviting the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary to a picnic near the border at Sopron But with the mass exodus at the PanEuropean Picnic the subsequent hesitant behavior of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the noninterference of the Soviet Union broke the dams Now tens of thousands of mediainformed East Germans made their way to Hungary which was no longer willing to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use armed force On the one hand this caused disagreement among the Eastern European states and on the other hand it was clear to the Eastern European population that the governments no longer had absolute power In 1989 the communist governments in Poland and Hungary became the first to negotiate the organization of competitive elections In Czechoslovakia and East Germany mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders The communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled in the latter case as the result of a violent uprising Attitudes had changed enough that US Secretary of State James Baker suggested that the American government would not be opposed to Soviet intervention in Romania on behalf of the opposition to prevent bloodshed The tidal wave of change culminated with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 which symbolized the collapse of European communist governments and graphically ended the Iron Curtain divide of Europe The 1989 revolutionary wave swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Sovietstyle MarxistLeninist states East Germany Poland Hungary Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria Romania was the only Easternbloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state Soviet dissolution At the same time the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the USSR constitution On 7 April 1990 a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than twothirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990 Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the War of Laws In 1989 the Russian SFSR convened a newly elected Congress of Peoples Deputies Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman On 12 June 1990 the Congress declared Russias sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws After a landslide victory of Sjdis in Lithuania that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990 citing the illegality of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states Soviet forces attempted to halt the secession by crushing popular demonstrations in Lithuania Bloody Sunday and Latvia The Barricades as a result numerous civilians were killed or wounded However these actions only bolstered international support for the secessionists A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics the remainder having boycotted the vote with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union in the form of a new federation The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost In the summer of 1991 the New Union Treaty which would have turned the country into a much looser Union was agreed upon by eight republics The signing of the treaty however was interrupted by the August Coupan attempted coup dtat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachevs reforms and reassert the central governments control over the republics After the coup collapsed Russian president Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions while Gorbachevs power was effectively ended The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics In August 1991 Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence following Lithuanias 1990 example Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August and soon afterwards the partys activities were indefinitely suspendedeffectively ending its rule By the fall Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin who had been elected President of Russia in July 1991 Later in August Gorbachev resigned as general secretary of the Communist party and Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the seizure of Soviet property Gorbachev clung to power as the President of the Soviet Union until 25 December 1991 when the USSR dissolved Fifteen states emerged from the Soviet Union with by far the largest and most populous one which also was the founder of the Soviet state with the October Revolution in Petrograd the Russian Federation taking full responsibility for all the rights and obligations of the USSR under the Charter of the United Nations including the financial obligations As such Russia assumed the Soviet Unions UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council nuclear stockpile and the control over the armed forces Soviet embassies abroad became Russian embassies In his 1992 State of the Union Address US President George H W Bush expressed his emotions The biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life in our lives is this By the grace of God America won the Cold War Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992 declaring a new era of friendship and partnership In January 1993 Bush and Yeltsin agreed to START II which provided for further nuclear arms reductions on top of the original START treaty Aftermath In summing up the international ramifications of these events Vladislav Zubok stated The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical military ideological and economic significance After the dissolution of the Soviet Union Russia drastically cut military spending and restructuring the economy left millions unemployed According to Western analysis the neoliberal reforms in Russia culminated in a recession in the early 1990s more severe than the Great Depression as experienced by the United States and Germany Western analysts suggest that in the 25 years following the end of the Cold War only five or six of the postcommunist states are on a path to joining the rich and capitalist world while most are falling behind some to such an extent that it will take several decades to catch up to where they were before the collapse of communism Estonia Latvia and Lithuania consider themselves as revivals of the three independent countries that existed prior to their occupation and annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940 They maintain that the process by which they were incorporated into the Soviet Union violated both international law and their own law and that in 19901991 they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed Communist parties outside the Baltic states were not outlawed and their members were not prosecuted Just a few places attempted to exclude members of communist secret services from decisionmaking In some countries the communist party changed its name and continued to function Decommunization Stephen Holmes of the University of Chicago argued in 1996 that decommunization after a brief active period quickly ended in nearuniversal failure After the introduction of lustration demand for scapegoats has become relatively low and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions Holmes notes that the only real exception was former East Germany where thousands of former Stasi informers have been fired from public positions Holmes suggests the following reasons for the failure of decommunization After 4570 years of communist rule nearly every family has members associated with the state After the initial desire to root out the reds came a realization that massive punishment is wrong and finding only some guilty is hardly justice The urgency of the current economic problems of postcommunism makes the crimes of the communist past old news for many citizens Decommunization is believed to be a power game of elites The difficulty of dislodging the social elite makes it require a totalitarian state to disenfranchise the enemies of the people quickly and efficiently and a desire for normalcy overcomes the desire for punitive justice Very few people have a perfectly clean slate and so are available to fill the positions that require significant expertise Compared with the decommunization efforts of the other former constituents of the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union decommunization in Russia has been restricted to halfmeasures if conducted at all Notable anticommunist measures in the Russian Federation include the banning of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the creation of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation as well as changing the names of some Russian cities back to what they were before the 1917 October Revolution Leningrad to Saint Petersburg Sverdlovsk to Yekaterinburg and Gorky to Nizhny Novgorod though others were maintained with Ulyanovsk former Simbirsk Tolyatti former Stavropol and Kirov former Vyatka being examples Even though Leningrad and Sverdlovsk were renamed regions that were named after them are still officially called Leningrad and Sverdlovsk oblasts Nostalgia for the Soviet Union is gradually on the rise in Russia Communist symbols continue to form an important part of the rhetoric used in statecontrolled media as banning on them in other countries is seen by the Russian foreign ministry as sacrilege and a perverse idea of good and evil The process of decommunization in Ukraine a neighbouring postSoviet state was met with fierce criticism by Russia The State Anthem of the Russian Federation adopted in 2000 the same year Vladimir Putin began his first term as president of Russia uses the exact same music as the State Anthem of the Soviet Union but with new lyrics written by Sergey Mikhalkov Conversely decommunization in Ukraine started during and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 With the success of the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 the Ukrainian government approved laws that outlawed communist symbols In July 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a set of laws that started a sixmonth period for the removal of communist monuments excluding World War II monuments and renaming of public places named after communistrelated themes At the time this meant that 22 cities and 44 villages were set to get new names In 2016 51493 streets and 987 cities and villages were renamed and 1320 Lenin monuments and 1069 monuments to other communist figures removed Violation of the law carries a penalty of a potential media ban and prison sentences of up to five years The Ministry of the Interior stripped the Communist Party of Ukraine the Communist Party of Ukraine renewed and the Communist Party of Workers and Peasants of their right to participate in elections and stated it was continuing the court actions that started in July 2014 to end the registration of communist parties in Ukraine By 16 December 2015 these three parties had been banned in Ukraine the Communist Party of Ukraine appealed the ban to the European Court of Human Rights Collapse of Yugoslavia and Balkan conflicts The Cold War had provided external stabilizing pressures Both the United States and the Soviet Union had a vested interest in Yugoslavias stability ensuring it remained a buffer state in the EastWest divide This resulted in financial and political support for its regime When the Cold War ended this external support evaporated leaving Yugoslavia more vulnerable to internal divisions As Yugoslavia fragmented the wars began after Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991 Serbia under Slobodan Miloevi opposed these moves The Bosnian War 19921995 was the most brutal of the Yugoslav Wars characterized by ethnic cleansing and genocide International organizations including the United Nations struggled to manage the violence NATO eventually intervened with airstrikes in Bosnia 1995 as part of Operation Deliberate Force and later in Kosovo 1999 as part of Operation allied force These interventions marked the transition of NATO as a deterrent to the Soviet Union to also functioning at the time as an active peacekeeping and conflictresolution force Influence The Cold War continues to influence world affairs The postCold War world is considered to be unipolar with the United States the sole remaining superpower The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World War IIby 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries with 526000 troops stationed abroad with 326000 in Europe twothirds of which were in West Germany and 130000 in Asia mainly Japan and South Korea The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime militaryindustrial complexes especially in the Soviet Union and the United States and largescale military funding of science These complexes though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century snowballed considerably during the Cold War Cumulative US military expenditures throughout the entire Cold War amounted to an estimated 8 trillion Further nearly 100000 Americans died in the Korean and Vietnam Wars Although Soviet casualties are difficult to estimate as a share of gross national product the financial cost for the Soviet Union was much higher than that incurred by the United States In addition to the loss of life by uniformed soldiers millions died in the superpowers proxy wars around the globe most notably in eastern Asia Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War interstate wars ethnic wars revolutionary wars as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the postCold War years However the aftermath of the Cold War is not considered to be concluded Many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts particularly in the former Yugoslavia In Central and Eastern Europe the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies while in other parts of the world such as Afghanistan independence was accompanied by state failure In popular culture During the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence people around the world especially using motion pictures The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected in entertainment media and continuing to the present with post1991 Cold Warthemed feature films novels television and web series and other media In 2013 a KGBsleeperagentslivingnextdoor action drama series The Americans set in the early 1980s was ranked No 6 on the Metacritic annual Best New TV Shows list its sixseason run concluded in May 2018 Historiography As soon as the term Cold War was popularized to refer to postwar tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians political scientists and journalists In particular historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of SovietUS relations after the Second World War and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable or could have been avoided Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was what the sources of the conflict were and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides Although explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified Historians commonly speak of three different approaches to the study of the Cold War orthodox accounts revisionism and postrevisionism Orthodox accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe Revisionist writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of postwar peace on the United States citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II Postrevisionists see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories See also Notes and quotes References Sources Books Reports Journal

    title: "International Space Station",
    originalContent:
      "The International Space Station ISS is a large space station that was assembled and is maintained in low Earth orbit by a collaboration of five space agencies and their contractors NASA United States Roscosmos Russia ESA Europe JAXA Japan and CSA Canada The ISS is the largest space station ever built Its primary purpose is to perform microgravity and space environment experiments Operationally the station is divided into two sections the Russian Orbital Segment ROS assembled by Roscosmos and the US Orbital Segment USOS assembled by NASA JAXA ESA and CSA A striking feature of the ISS is the Integrated Truss Structure which connects the large solar panels and radiators to the pressurized modules The pressurized modules are specialized for research habitation storage spacecraft control and airlock functions Visiting spacecraft dock at the station via its eight docking and berthing ports The ISS maintains an orbit with an average altitude of 400 kilometres 250 mi and circles the Earth in roughly 93 minutes completing 155 orbits per day The ISS programme combines two prior plans to construct crewed Earthorbiting stations Space Station Freedom planned by the United States and the Mir2 station planned by the Soviet Union The first ISS module was launched in 1998 Major modules have been launched by Proton and Soyuz rockets and by the Space Shuttle launch system The first longterm residents Expedition 1 arrived on 2 November 2000 Since then the station has been continuously occupied for 24 years and 42 days the longest continuous human presence in space As of March 2024 279 individuals from 22 countries have visited the space station The ISS is expected to have additional modules the Axiom Orbital Segment for example and will be in service until the end of 2030 after which it is planned to be deorbited by a dedicated NASA spacecraft Conception Purpose The ISS was originally intended to be a laboratory observatory and factory while providing transportation maintenance and a low Earth orbit staging base for possible future missions to the Moon Mars and asteroids However not all of the uses envisioned in the initial memorandum of understanding between NASA and Roscosmos have been realised In the 2010 United States National Space Policy the ISS was given additional roles of serving commercial diplomatic and educational purposes Scientific research The ISS provides a platform to conduct scientific research with power data cooling and crew available to support experiments Small uncrewed spacecraft can also provide platforms for experiments especially those involving zero gravity and exposure to space but space stations offer a longterm environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades combined with ready access by human researchers The ISS simplifies individual experiments by allowing groups of experiments to share the same launches and crew time Research is conducted in a wide variety of fields including astrobiology astronomy physical sciences materials science space weather meteorology and human research including space medicine and the life sciences Scientists on Earth have timely access to the data and can suggest experimental modifications to the crew If followon experiments are necessary the routinely scheduled launches of resupply craft allows new hardware to be launched with relative ease Crews fly expeditions of several months duration providing approximately 160 personhours per week of labour with a crew of six However a considerable amount of crew time is taken up by station maintenance Perhaps the most notable ISS experiment is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer AMS which is intended to detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe According to NASA the AMS is as important as the Hubble Space Telescope Currently docked on station it could not have been easily accommodated on a free flying satellite platform because of its power and bandwidth needs On 3 April 2013 scientists reported that hints of dark matter may have been detected by the AMS According to the scientists The first results from the spaceborne Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of highenergy positrons in Earthbound cosmic rays The space environment is hostile to life Unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from the solar wind in addition to cosmic rays high vacuum extreme temperatures and microgravity Some simple forms of life called extremophiles as well as small invertebrates called tardigrades can survive in this environment in an extremely dry state through desiccation Medical research improves knowledge about the effects of longterm space exposure on the human body including muscle atrophy bone loss and fluid shift These data will be used to determine whether high duration human spaceflight and space colonisation are feasible In 2006 data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggested that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise such as the sixmonth interval required to travel to Mars Medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS on behalf of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute NSBRI Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space Usually there is no physician on board the ISS and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult In August 2020 scientists reported that bacteria from Earth particularly Deinococcus radiodurans bacteria which is highly resistant to environmental hazards were found to survive for three years in outer space based on studies conducted on the International Space Station These findings supported the notion of panspermia the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe distributed in various ways including space dust meteoroids asteroids comets planetoids or contaminated spacecraft Remote sensing of the Earth astronomy and deep space research on the ISS have significantly increased during the 2010s after the completion of the US Orbital Segment in 2011 Throughout the more than 20 years of the ISS program researchers aboard the ISS and on the ground have examined aerosols ozone lightning and oxides in Earths atmosphere as well as the Sun cosmic rays cosmic dust antimatter and dark matter in the universe Examples of Earthviewing remote sensing experiments that have flown on the ISS are the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 ISSRapidScat ECOSTRESS the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation and the Cloud Aerosol Transport System ISSbased astronomy telescopes and experiments include SOLAR the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer the Calorimetric Electron Telescope the Monitor of Allsky Xray Image MAXI and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Freefall Gravity at the altitude of the ISS is approximately 90 as strong as at Earths surface but objects in orbit are in a continuous state of freefall resulting in an apparent state of weightlessness This perceived weightlessness is disturbed by five effects Drag from the residual atmosphere Vibration from the movements of mechanical systems and the crew Actuation of the onboard attitude control moment gyroscopes Thruster firings for attitude or orbital changes Gravitygradient effects also known as tidal effects Items at different locations within the ISS would if not attached to the station follow slightly different orbits Being mechanically connected these items experience small forces that keep the station moving as a rigid body Researchers are investigating the effect of the stations nearweightless environment on the evolution development growth and internal processes of plants and animals In response to some of the data NASA wants to investigate microgravitys effects on the growth of threedimensional humanlike tissues and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space Investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids Because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth Examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding of superconductivity The study of materials science is an important ISS research activity with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on Earth Other areas of interest include the effect of low gravity on combustion through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants These findings may improve knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits Exploration The ISS provides a location in the relative safety of low Earth orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for longduration missions to the Moon and Mars This provides experience in operations maintenance and repair and replacement activities onorbit This will help develop essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from Earth reduce mission risks and advance the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft Referring to the MARS500 experiment a crew isolation experiment conducted on Earth ESA states Whereas the ISS is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness radiation and other spacespecific factors aspects such as the effect of longterm isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via groundbased simulations Sergey Krasnov the head of human space flight programmes for Russias space agency Roscosmos in 2011 suggested a shorter version of MARS500 may be carried out on the ISS In 2009 noting the value of the partnership framework itself Sergey Krasnov wrote When compared with partners acting separately partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration The ISS is helping further advance nearEarth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the Solar system including the Moon and Mars A crewed mission to Mars may be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current ISS partnership In 2010 ESA DirectorGeneral JeanJacques Dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that China India and South Korea be invited to join the ISS partnership NASA chief Charles Bolden stated in February 2011 Any mission to Mars is likely to be a global effort Currently US federal legislation prevents NASA cooperation with China on space projects without approval by the FBI and Congress Education and cultural outreach The ISS crew provides opportunities for students on Earth by running studentdeveloped experiments making educational demonstrations allowing for student participation in classroom versions of ISS experiments and directly engaging students using radio and email ESA offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for use in classrooms In one lesson students can navigate a 3D model of the interior and exterior of the ISS and face spontaneous challenges to solve in real time The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA aims to inspire children to pursue craftsmanship and to heighten their awareness of the importance of life and their responsibilities in society Through a series of education guides students develop a deeper understanding of the past and nearterm future of crewed space flight as well as that of Earth and life In the JAXA Seeds in Space experiments the mutation effects of spaceflight on plant seeds aboard the ISS are explored by growing sunflower seeds that have flown on the ISS for about nine months In the first phase of Kib utilisation from 2008 to mid2010 researchers from more than a dozen Japanese universities conducted experiments in diverse fields Cultural activities are another major objective of the ISS programme Tetsuo Tanaka the director of JAXAs Space Environment and Utilization Center has said There is something about space that touches even people who are not interested in science Amateur Radio on the ISS ARISS is a volunteer programme that encourages students worldwide to pursue careers in science technology engineering and mathematics through amateur radio communications opportunities with the ISS crew ARISS is an international working group consisting of delegations from nine countries including several in Europe as well as Japan Russia Canada and the United States In areas where radio equipment cannot be used speakerphones connect students to ground stations which then connect the calls to the space station First Orbit is a 2011 featurelength documentary film about Vostok 1 the first crewed space flight around the Earth By matching the orbit of the ISS to that of Vostok 1 as closely as possible in terms of ground path and time of day documentary filmmaker Christopher Riley and ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli were able to film the view that Yuri Gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight This new footage was cut together with the original Vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the Russian State Archive Nespoli is credited as the director of photography for this documentary film as he recorded the majority of the footage himself during Expedition 2627 The film was streamed in a global YouTube premiere in 2011 under a free licence through the website firstorbitorg In May 2013 commander Chris Hadfield shot a music video of David Bowies Space Oddity on board the station which was released on YouTube It was the first music video filmed in space In November 2017 while participating in Expedition 5253 on the ISS Paolo Nespoli made two recordings of his spoken voice one in English and the other in his native Italian for use on Wikipedia articles These were the first content made in space specifically for Wikipedia In November 2021 a virtual reality exhibit called The Infinite featuring life aboard the ISS was announced Construction Manufacturing The International Space Station is a product of global collaboration with its components manufactured across the world The modules of the Russian Orbital Segment including Zarya and Zvezda were produced at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center in Moscow Zvezda was initially manufactured in 1985 as a component for the Mir2 space station which was never launched Much of the US Orbital Segment including the Destiny and Unity modules the Integrated Truss Structure and solar arrays were built at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama and Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans These components underwent final assembly and processing for launch at the Operations and Checkout Building and the Space Station Processing Facility SSPF at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida The US Orbital Segment also hosts the Columbus module contributed by the European Space Agency and built in Germany the Kib module contributed by Japan and built at the Tsukuba Space Center and the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science along with the Canadarm2 and Dextre a joint CanadianUS endeavor All of these components were shipped to the SSPF for launch processing Assembly The assembly of the International Space Station a major endeavour in space architecture began in November 1998 Modules in the Russian segment launched and docked autonomously with the exception of Rassvet Other modules and components were delivered by the Space Shuttle which then had to be installed by astronauts either remotely using robotic arms or during spacewalks more formally known as extravehicular activities EVAs By 5 June 2011 astronauts had made over 159 EVAs to add components to the station totaling more than 1000 hours in space The foundation for the ISS was laid with the launch of the Russianbuilt Zarya module atop a Proton rocket on 20 November 1998 Zarya provided propulsion attitude control communications and electrical power Two weeks later on 4 December 1998 the Americanmade Unity was ferried aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS88 and joined with Zarya Unity provided the connection between the Russian and US segments of the station and would provide ports to connect future modules and visiting spacecraft While the connection of two modules built on different continents by nations that were once bitter rivals was a significant milestone these two initial modules lacked life support systems and the ISS remained unmanned for the next two years At the time the Russian station Mir was still inhabited The turning point arrived in July 2000 with the launch of the Zvezda module Equipped with living quarters and lifesupport systems Zvezda enabled continuous human presence aboard the station The first crew Expedition 1 arrived that November aboard Soyuz TM31 The ISS grew steadily over the following years with modules delivered by both Russian rockets and the Space Shuttle Expedition 1 arrived midway between the Space Shuttle flights of missions STS92 and STS97 These two flights each added segments of the stations Integrated Truss Structure which provided the station with Ku band communications additional attitude control needed for the additional mass of the USOS and additional solar arrays Over the next two years the station continued to expand A SoyuzU rocket delivered the Pirs docking compartment The Space Shuttles Discovery Atlantis and Endeavour delivered the American Destiny laboratory and Quest airlock in addition to the stations main robot arm the Canadarm2 and several more segments of the Integrated Truss Structure Tragedy struck in 2003 with the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia which grounded the rest of the Shuttle fleet halting construction of the ISSAssembly resumed in 2006 with the arrival of STS115 with Atlantis which delivered the stations second set of solar arrays Several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on STS116 STS117 and STS118 As a result of the major expansion of the stations powergenerating capabilities more modules could be accommodated and the US Harmony module and Columbus European laboratory were added These were soon followed by the first two components of the Japanese Kib laboratory In March 2009 STS119 completed the Integrated Truss Structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays The final section of Kib was delivered in July 2009 on STS127 followed by the Russian Poisk module The US Tranquility module was delivered in February 2010 during STS130 alongside the Cupola followed by the penultimate Russian module Rassvet in May 2010 Rassvet was delivered by Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS132 in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the USfunded Zarya module in 1998 The last pressurised module of the USOS Leonardo was brought to the station in February 2011 on the final flight of Discovery STS133 Russias new primary research module Nauka docked in July 2021 along with the European Robotic Arm which can relocate itself to different parts of the Russian modules of the station Russias latest addition the Prichal module docked in November 2021 As of November 2021 the station consists of 18 pressurised modules including airlocks and the Integrated Truss Structure Structure The ISS functions as a modular space station enabling the addition or removal of modules from its structure for increased adaptability Below is a diagram of major station components The Unity node joins directly to the Destiny laboratory for clarity they are shown apart Similar cases are also seen in other parts of the structure Key to box background colors Pressurised component accessible by the crew without using spacesuits Dockingberthing port pressurized when a visiting spacecraft is present Airlock to move people or material between pressurized and unpressurized environment Unpressurised station superstructure Unpressurised component Temporarily defunct or noncommissioned component Former no longer installed component Future not yet installed component Pressurised modules Zarya Zarya Russian lit Sunrise also known as the Functional Cargo Block Russian was the inaugural component of the ISS Launched in 1998 it initially served as the ISSs power source storage propulsion and guidance system As the station has grown Zaryas role has transitioned primarily to storage both internally and in its external fuel tanks A descendant of the TKS spacecraft used in the Salyut programme Zarya was built in Russia but is owned by the United States Its name symbolizes the beginning of a new era of international space cooperation Unity Unity also known as Node 1 is the inaugural USbuilt component of the ISS Serving as the connection between the Russian and US segments this cylindrical module features six Common Berthing Mechanism locations forward aft port starboard zenith and nadir for attaching additional modules Measuring 457 metres 150 ft in diameter and 547 metres 179 ft in length Unity was constructed of steel by Boeing for NASA at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama It was the first of three connecting nodes Unity Harmony and Tranquility that forms the structural backbone of the US segment of the ISS Zvezda Zvezda Russian lit star launched in July 2000 is the core of the Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS Initially providing essential living quarters and life support systems it enabled the first continuous human presence aboard the station While additional modules have expanded the ISSs capabilities Zvezda remains the command and control center for the Russian segment and it is where crews gather during emergencies A descendant of the Salyut programmes DOS spacecraft Zvezda was built by RKK Energia and launched atop a Proton rocket Destiny The Destiny laboratory is the primary research facility for US experiments on the ISS NASAs first permanent orbital research station since Skylab the module was built by Boeing and launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS98 Attached to Unity over a period of five days in February 2001 Destiny has been a hub for scientific research ever since Within Destiny astronauts conduct experiments in fields such as medicine engineering biotechnology physics materials science and Earth science Researchers worldwide benefit from these studies The module also houses life support systems including the Oxygen Generating System Quest Joint Airlock The Quest Joint Airlock enables extravehicular activities EVAs using either the US Extravehicular Mobility Unit EMU or the Russian Orlan space suit Before its installation conducting EVAs from the ISS was challenging due to a variety of system and design differences Only the Orlan suit could be used from the Transfer Chamber on the Zvezda module which was not a purposebuilt airlock and the EMU could only be used from the airlock on a visiting Space Shuttle which could not accommodate the Orlan Launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS104 in July 2001 and attached to the Unity module Quest is a 61metrelong 20 ft 40metrewide 13 ft structure built by Boeing It houses the crew airlock for astronaut egress an equipment airlock for suit storage and has facilities to accommodate astronauts during their overnight prebreathe procedures to prevent decompression sickness The crew airlock derived from the Space Shuttle features essential equipment like lighting handrails and an Umbilical Interface Assembly UIA that provides life support and communication systems for up to two spacesuits simultaneously These can be either two EMUs two Orlan suits or one of each design Poisk Poisk Russian lit Search also known as the MiniResearch Module 2 Russian 2 serves as both a secondary airlock on the Russian segment of the ISS and supports docking for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft facilitates propellant transfers from the latter Launched on 10 November 2009 attached to a modified Progress spacecraft called Progress MMIM2 Poisk provides facilities to maintain Orlan spacesuits and is equipped with two inwardopening hatches a design change from Mir which encountered a dangerous situation caused by an outwardopening hatch that opened too quickly because of a small amount of air pressure remaining in the airlock Since the departure of Pirs in 2021 its become the sole airlock on the Russian segment Harmony Harmony or Node 2 is the central connecting hub of the US segment of the ISS linking the US European and Japanese laboratory modules Its also been called the utility hub of the ISS as it provides essential power data and life support systems The module also houses sleeping quarters for four crew members Launched on 23 October 2007 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery on STS120 Harmony was initially attached to the Unity before being relocated to its permanent position at the front of the Destiny laboratory on 14 November 2007 This expansion added significant living space to the ISS marking a key milestone in the construction of the US segment Tranquility Tranquility also known as Node 3 is a module of the ISS It contains environmental control systems life support systems a toilet exercise equipment and an observation cupola The European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency had Tranquility manufactured by Thales Alenia Space A ceremony on 20 November 2009 transferred ownership of the module to NASA On 8 February 2010 NASA launched the module on the Space Shuttles STS130 mission Columbus Columbus is a science laboratory that is part of the ISS and is the largest single contribution to the station made by the European Space Agency Like the Harmony and Tranquility modules the Columbus laboratory was constructed in Turin Italy by Thales Alenia Space The functional equipment and software of the lab was designed by EADS in Bremen Germany It was also integrated in Bremen before being flown to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in an Airbus Beluga jet It was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on 7 February 2008 on flight STS122 It is designed for ten years of operation The module is controlled by the Columbus Control Centre located at the German Space Operations Center part of the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich Germany The European Space Agency has spent 14 billion about US16 billion on building Columbus including the experiments it carries and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them Kib Kib Japanese lit hope also known as the Japanese Experiment Module is Japans research facility on the ISS It is the largest single module on the ISS consisting of a pressurized lab an exposed facility for conducting experiments in the space environment two storage compartments and a robotic arm Attached to the Harmony module Kib was assembled in space over three Space Shuttle missions STS123 STS124 and STS127 Cupola The Cupola is an ESAbuilt observatory module of the ISS Its name derives from the Italian word cupola which means dome Its seven windows are used to conduct experiments dockings and observations of Earth It was launched aboard Space Shuttle mission STS130 on 8 February 2010 and attached to the Tranquility Node 3 module With the Cupola attached ISS assembly reached 85 per cent completion The Cupolas central window has a diameter of 80 cm 31 in Rassvet Rassvet Russian lit first light also known as the MiniResearch Module 1 Russian 1 and formerly known as the Docking Cargo Module is primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft on the Russian segment of the ISS Rassvet replaced the cancelled Docking and Storage Module and used a design largely based on the Mir Docking Module built in 1995 Rassvet was delivered in on 14 May 2010 Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS132 in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the USfunded Zarya module in 1998 Rassvet was attached to Zarya shortly thereafter Leonardo The Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module PMM is a module of the International Space Station It was flown into space aboard the Space Shuttle on STS133 on 24 February 2011 and installed on 1 March Leonardo is primarily used for storage of spares supplies and waste on the ISS which was until then stored in many different places within the space station It is also the personal hygiene area for the astronauts who live in the US Orbital Segment The Leonardo PMM was a MultiPurpose Logistics Module MPLM before 2011 but was modified into its current configuration It was formerly one of two MPLM used for bringing cargo to and from the ISS with the Space Shuttle The module was named for Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci Bigelow Expandable Activity Module The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module BEAM is an experimental expandable space station module developed by Bigelow Aerospace under contract to NASA for testing as a temporary module on the International Space Station ISS from 2016 to at least 2020 It arrived at the ISS on 10 April 2016 was berthed to the station on 16 April at Tranquility Node 3 and was expanded and pressurized on 28 May 2016 In December 2021 Bigelow Aerospace conveyed ownership of the module to NASA as a result of Bigelows cessation of activity International Docking Adapters The International Docking Adapter IDA is a spacecraft docking system adapter developed to convert APAS95 to the NASA Docking System NDS An IDA is placed on each of the ISSs two open Pressurized Mating Adapters PMAs both of which are connected to the Harmony module Two International Docking Adapters are currently installed aboard the Station Originally IDA1 was planned to be installed on PMA2 located at Harmonys forward port and IDA2 would be installed on PMA3 at Harmonys zenith After IDA 1 was destroyed in a launch incident IDA2 was installed on PMA2 on 19 August 2016 while IDA3 was later installed on PMA3 on 21 August 2019 Bishop Airlock Module The NanoRacks Bishop Airlock Module is a commercially funded airlock module launched to the ISS on SpaceX CRS21 on 6 December 2020 The module was built by NanoRacks Thales Alenia Space and Boeing It will be used to deploy CubeSats small satellites and other external payloads for NASA CASIS and other commercial and governmental customers Nauka Nauka Russian lit Science also known as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module Upgrade Russian is a Roscosmosfunded component of the ISS that was launched on 21 July 2021 1458 UTC In the original ISS plans Nauka was to use the location of the Docking and Stowage Module DSM but the DSM was later replaced by the Rassvet module and moved to Zaryas nadir port Nauka was successfully docked to Zvezdas nadir port on 29 July 2021 1329 UTC replacing the Pirs module It had a temporary docking adapter on its nadir port for crewed and uncrewed missions until Prichal arrival where just before its arrival it was removed by a departing Progress spacecraft Prichal Prichal Russian lit pier is a 4tonne 8800 lb spherical module that serves as a docking hub for the Russian segment of the ISS Launched in November 2021 Prichal provides additional docking ports for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft as well as potential future modules Prichal features six docking ports forward aft port starboard zenith and nadir One of these ports equipped with an active hybrid docking system enabled it to dock with the Nauka module The remaining five ports are passive hybrids allowing for docking of Soyuz Progress and heavier modules as well as future spacecraft with modified docking systems As of 2024 the forward aft port and starboard docking ports remain covered Prichal was initially intended to be an element of the now canceled Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex Unpressurised elements The ISS has a large number of external components that do not require pressurisation The largest of these is the Integrated Truss Structure ITS to which the stations main solar arrays and thermal radiators are mounted The ITS consists of ten separate segments forming a structure 1085 metres 356 ft long The station was intended to have several smaller external components such as six robotic arms three External Stowage Platforms ESPs and four ExPRESS Logistics Carriers ELCs While these platforms allow experiments including MISSE the STPH3 and the Robotic Refueling Mission to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally their primary function is to store spare Orbital Replacement Units ORUs ORUs are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life including pumps storage tanks antennas and battery units Such units are replaced either by astronauts during EVA or by robotic arms Several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of ORUs including STS129 STS133 and STS134 As of January 2011 only one other mode of transportation of ORUs had been used the Japanese cargo vessel HTV2 which delivered an FHRC and CTC2 via its Exposed Pallet EP There are also smaller exposure facilities mounted directly to laboratory modules the Kib Exposed Facility serves as an external porch for the Kib complex and a facility on the European Columbus laboratory provides power and data connections for experiments such as the European Technology Exposure Facility and the Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space A remote sensing instrument SAGE IIIISS was delivered to the station in February 2017 aboard CRS10 and the NICER experiment was delivered aboard CRS11 in June 2017 The largest scientific payload externally mounted to the ISS is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer AMS a particle physics experiment launched on STS134 in May 2011 and mounted externally on the ITS The AMS measures cosmic rays to look for evidence of dark matter and antimatter The commercial Bartolomeo External Payload Hosting Platform manufactured by Airbus was launched on 6 March 2020 aboard CRS20 and attached to the European Columbus module It will provide an additional 12 external payload slots supplementing the eight on the ExPRESS Logistics Carriers ten on Kib and four on Columbus The system is designed to be robotically serviced and will require no astronaut intervention It is named after Christopher Columbuss younger brother MLM outfittings In May 2010 equipment for Nauka was launched on STS132 as part of an agreement with NASA and delivered by Space Shuttle Atlantis Weighing 14 metric tons the equipment was attached to the outside of Rassvet MRM1 It included a spare elbow joint for the European Robotic Arm ERA which was launched with Nauka and an ERAportable workpost used during EVAs as well as RTOd addon heat radiator and internal hardware alongside the pressurized experiment airlock The RTOd radiator adds additional cooling capability to Nauka which enables the module to host more scientific experiments The ERA was used to remove the RTOd radiator from Rassvet and transferred over to Nauka during VKD56 spacewalk Later it was activated and fully deployed on VKD58 spacewalk This process took several months A portable work platform was also transferred over in August 2023 during VKD60 spacewalk which can attach to the end of the ERA to allow cosmonauts to ride on the end of the arm during spacewalks However even after several months of outfitting EVAs and RTOd heat radiator installation six months later the RTOd radiator malfunctioned before active use of Nauka the purpose of RTOd installation is to radiate heat from Nauka experiments The malfunction a leak rendered the RTOd radiator unusable for Nauka This is the third ISS radiator leak after Soyuz MS22 and Progress MS21 radiator leaks If a spare RTOd is not available Nauka experiments will have to rely on Naukas main launch radiator and the module could never be used to its full capacity Another MLM outfitting is a 4 segment external payload interface called means of attachment of large payloads Sredstva Krepleniya Krupnogabaritnykh Obyektov SKKO Delivered in two parts to Nauka by Progress MS18 LCCS part and Progress MS21 SCCCS part as part of the module activation outfitting process It was taken outside and installed on the ERA aft facing base point on Nauka during the VKD55 spacewalk Robotic arms and cargo cranes The Integrated Truss Structure ITS serves as a base for the stations primary remote manipulator system the Mobile Servicing System MSS which is composed of three main components Canadarm2 the largest robotic arm on the ISS has a mass of 1800 kilograms 4000 lb and is used to dock and manipulate spacecraft and modules on the USOS hold crew members and equipment in place during EVAs and move Dextre to perform tasks Dextre is a 1560 kg 3440 lb robotic manipulator that has two arms and a rotating torso with power tools lights and video for replacing orbital replacement units ORUs and performing other tasks requiring fine control The Mobile Base System MBS is a platform that rides on rails along the length of the stations main truss which serves as a mobile base for Canadarm2 and Dextre allowing the robotic arms to reach all parts of the USOS A grapple fixture was added to Zarya on STS134 to enable Canadarm2 to inchworm itself onto the ROS Also installed during STS134 was the 15 m 50 ft Orbiter Boom Sensor System OBSS which had been used to inspect heat shield tiles on Space Shuttle missions and which can be used on the station to increase the reach of the MSS Staff on Earth or the ISS can operate the MSS components using remote control performing work outside the station without the need for space walks Japans Remote Manipulator System which services the Kib Exposed Facility was launched on STS124 and is attached to the Kib Pressurised Module The arm is similar to the Space Shuttle arm as it is permanently attached at one end and has a latching end effector for standard grapple fixtures at the other The European Robotic Arm which will service the ROS was launched alongside the Nauka module The ROS does not require spacecraft or modules to be manipulated as all spacecraft and modules dock automatically and may be discarded the same way Crew use the two Strela Russian lit Arrow cargo cranes during EVAs for moving crew and equipment around the ROS Each Strela crane has a mass of 45 kg 99 lb Former module Pirs Pirs Russian lit Pier was launched on 14 September 2001 as ISS Assembly Mission 4R on a Russian SoyuzU rocket using a modified Progress spacecraft Progress MSO1 as an upper stage Pirs was undocked by Progress MS16 on 26 July 2021 1056 UTC and deorbited on the same day at 1451 UTC to make room for Nauka module to be attached to the space station Prior to its departure Pirs served as the primary Russian airlock on the station being used to store and refurbish the Russian Orlan spacesuits Planned components Axiom segment In January 2020 NASA awarded Axiom Space a contract to build a commercial module for the ISS The contract is under the NextSTEP2 program NASA negotiated with Axiom on a firm fixedprice contract basis to build and deliver the module which will attach to the forward port of the space stations Harmony Node 2 module Although NASA has only commissioned one module Axiom plans to build an entire segment consisting of five modules including a node module an orbital research and manufacturing facility a crew habitat and a largewindowed Earth observatory The Axiom segment is expected to greatly increase the capabilities and value of the space station allowing for larger crews and private spaceflight by other organisations Axiom plans to convert the segment into a standalone space station once the ISS is decommissioned with the intention that this would act as a successor to the ISS Canadarm 2 which will be used to berth the Axiom Space Station modules to the ISS is planned to continue its operations on the Axiom Space Station after the retirement of ISS in late 2020s As of December 2023 Axiom Space expected to launch the first module Hab One at the end of 2026 US Deorbit Vehicle The US Deorbit Vehicle USDV is a NASAprovided spacecraft intended to perform a controlled deorbit and demise of the station after the end of its operational life in 2030 In June 2024 NASA awarded SpaceX a contract to build the Deorbit Vehicle NASA plans to deorbit ISS as soon as they have the minimum capability in orbit the USDV and at least one commercial station Cancelled components Several modules developed or planned for the station were cancelled over the course of the ISS programme Reasons include budgetary constraints the modules becoming unnecessary and station redesigns after the 2003 Columbia disaster The US Centrifuge Accommodations Module would have hosted science experiments in varying levels of artificial gravity The US Habitation Module would have served as the stations living quarters Instead the living quarters are now spread throughout the station The US Interim Control Module and ISS Propulsion Module would have replaced the functions of Zvezda in case of a launch failure Two Russian Research Modules were planned for scientific research They would have docked to a Russian Universal Docking Module The Russian Science Power Platform would have supplied power to the Russian Orbital Segment independent of the ITS solar arrays Science Power Modules 1 and 2 Repurposed Components Science Power Module 1 SPM1 also known as NEM1 and Science Power Module 2 SPM2 also known as NEM2 are modules that were originally planned to arrive at the ISS no earlier than 2024 and dock to the Prichal module which is docked to the Nauka module In April 2021 Roscosmos announced that NEM1 would be repurposed to function as the core module of the proposed Russian Orbital Service Station ROSS launching no earlier than 2027 and docking to the freeflying Nauka module NEM2 may be converted into another core base module which would be launched in 2028 Xbase Designed by Bigelow Aerospace In August 2016 Bigelow negotiated an agreement with NASA to develop a fullsize ground prototype Deep Space Habitation based on the B330 under the second phase of Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships The module was called the Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement XBASE as Bigelow hoped to test the module by attaching it to the International Space Station However in March 2020 Bigelow laid off all 88 of its employees and as of February 2024 the company remains dormant and is considered defunct making it appear unlikely that the XBASE module will ever be launched NautilusX Centrifuge Demonstration A proposal was put forward in 2011 for a first inspace demonstration of a sufficiently scaled centrifuge for artificial partialg gravity effects It was designed to become a sleep module for the ISS crew The project was cancelled in favour of other projects due to budget constraints Onboard systems Life support The critical systems are the atmosphere control system the water supply system the food supply facilities the sanitation and hygiene equipment and fire detection and suppression equipment The Russian Orbital Segments life support systems are contained in the Zvezda service module Some of these systems are supplemented by equipment in the USOS The Nauka laboratory has a complete set of life support systems Atmospheric control systems The atmosphere on board the ISS is similar to that of Earth Normal air pressure on the ISS is 1013 kPa 1469 psi the same as at sea level on Earth An Earthlike atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort and is much safer than a pure oxygen atmosphere because of the increased risk of a fire such as that responsible for the deaths of the Apollo 1 crew Earthlike atmospheric conditions have been maintained on all Russian and Soviet spacecraft The Elektron system aboard Zvezda and a similar system in Destiny generate oxygen aboard the station The crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation SFOG canisters a chemical oxygen generator system Carbon dioxide is removed from the air by the Vozdukh system in Zvezda Other byproducts of human metabolism such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat are removed by activated charcoal filters Part of the ROS atmosphere control system is the oxygen supply Tripleredundancy is provided by the Elektron unit solid fuel generators and stored oxygen The primary supply of oxygen is the Elektron unit which produces O2 and H2 by electrolysis of water and vents H2 overboard The 1 kW 13 hp system uses approximately one litre of water per crew member per day This water is either brought from Earth or recycled from other systems Mir was the first spacecraft to use recycled water for oxygen production The secondary oxygen supply is provided by burning oxygenproducing Vika cartridges see also ISS ECLSS Each candle takes 520 minutes to decompose at 450500 C 842932 F producing 600 litres 130 imp gal 160 US gal of O2 This unit is manually operated The US Orbital Segment USOS has redundant supplies of oxygen from a pressurised storage tank on the Quest airlock module delivered in 2001 supplemented ten years later by ESAbuilt Advanced ClosedLoop System ACLS in the Tranquility module Node 3 which produces O2 by electrolysis Hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere and converted to water and methane Power and thermal control Doublesided solar arrays provide electrical power to the ISS These bifacial cells collect direct sunlight on one side and light reflected off from the Earth on the other and are more efficient and operate at a lower temperature than singlesided cells commonly used on Earth The Russian segment of the station like most spacecraft uses 28 V low voltage DC from two rotating solar arrays mounted on Zvezda The USOS uses 130180 V DC from the USOS PV array Power is stabilised and distributed at 160 V DC and converted to the userrequired 124 V DC The higher distribution voltage allows smaller lighter conductors at the expense of crew safety The two station segments share power with converters The USOS solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts These arrays normally track the Sun to maximise power generation Each array is about 375 m2 4036 sq ft in area and 58 m 190 ft long In the complete configuration the solar arrays track the Sun by rotating the alpha gimbal once per orbit the beta gimbal follows slower changes in the angle of the Sun to the orbital plane The Night Glider mode aligns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the stations relatively low orbital altitude The station originally used rechargeable nickelhydrogen batteries NiH2 for continuous power during the 45 minutes of every 90minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the Earth The batteries are recharged on the day side of the orbit They had a 65year lifetime over 37000 chargedischarge cycles and were regularly replaced over the anticipated 20year life of the station Starting in 2016 the nickelhydrogen batteries were replaced by lithiumion batteries which are expected to last until the end of the ISS program The stations large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere This could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath To mitigate this plasma contactor units create current paths between the station and the ambient space plasma The stations systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power almost all of which is converted to heat To keep the internal temperature within workable limits a passive thermal control system PTCS is made of external surface materials insulation such as MLI and heat pipes If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load an External Active Thermal Control System EATCS maintains the temperature The EATCS consists of an internal nontoxic water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop From the heat exchangers ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation then the ammonia is cycled back to the station The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules including Kib and Columbus as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0 S1 and P1 trusses It can reject up to 70 kW This is much more than the 14 kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System EEATCS via the Early Ammonia Servicer EAS which was launched on STS105 and installed onto the P6 Truss Communications and computers The ISS relies on various radio communication systems to provide telemetry and scientific data links between the station and mission control centres Radio links are also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members flight controllers and family members As a result the ISS is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes The Russian Orbital Segment primarily uses the Lira antenna mounted on Zvezda for direct ground communication It also had the capability to utilize the Luch data relay satellite system which was in a state of disrepair when the station was built but was restored to operational status in 2011 and 2012 with the launch of Luch5A and Luch5B Additionally the VoskhodM system provides internal telephone communications and VHF radio links to ground control The US Orbital Segment USOS makes use of two separate radio links S band audio telemetry commanding located on the P1S1 truss and Ku band audio video and data located on the Z1 truss systems These transmissions are routed via the United States Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System TDRSS in geostationary orbit allowing for almost continuous realtime communications with Christopher C Kraft Jr Mission Control Center MCCH in Houston Texas Data channels for the Canadarm2 European Columbus laboratory and Japanese Kib modules were originally also routed via the S band and Ku band systems with the European Data Relay System and a similar Japanese system intended to eventually complement the TDRSS in this role UHF radio is used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting EVAs and other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station Automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment the ATV used a laser attached to the spacecraft and the Proximity Communications Equipment attached to Zvezda to accurately dock with the station The US Orbital Segment of the ISS is equipped with approximately 100 commercial offtheshelf laptops running Windows or Linux These devices are modified to use the stations 28V DC power system and with additional ventilation since heat generated by the devices can stagnate in the weightless environment NASA prefers to keep a high commonality between laptops and spare parts are kept on the station so astronauts can repair laptops when needed The laptops are divided into two groups the Portable Computer System PCS and Station Support Computers SSC PCS laptops run Linux and are used for connecting to the stations primary Command Control computer CC MDM which runs on Debian Linux a switch made from Windows in 2013 for reliability and flexibility The primary computer supervises the critical systems that keep the station in orbit and supporting life Since the primary computer has no display or keyboards astronauts use a PCS laptop to connect as remote terminals via a USB to 1553 adapter The primary computer experienced failures in 2001 2007 and 2017 The 2017 failure required a spacewalk to replace external components SSC laptops are used for everything else on the station including reviewing procedures managing scientific experiments communicating over email or video chat and for entertainment during downtime SSC laptops connect to the stations wireless LAN via WiFi which connects to the ground via the Ku band While originally this provided speeds of 10 Mbits download and 3 Mbits upload from the station NASA upgraded the system in 2019 and increased the speeds to 600 Mbits ISS crew members have access to the internet Operations Expeditions Each permanent crew is given an expedition number Expeditions run up to six months from launch until undocking an increment covers the same time period but includes cargo spacecraft and all activities Expeditions 1 to 6 consisted of threeperson crews After the destruction of NASAs Space Shuttle Columbia Expeditions 7 to 12 were reduced to twoperson caretaker crews who could maintain the station because a larger crew could not be fully resupplied by the small Russian Progress cargo spacecraft After the Shuttle fleet returned to flight three person crews also returned to the ISS beginning with Expedition 13 As the Shuttle flights expanded the station crew sizes also expanded eventually reaching six around 2010 With the arrival of crew on larger US commercial spacecraft beginning in 2020 crew size has been increased to seven the number for which ISS was originally designed Oleg Kononenko of Roscosmos holds the record for the longest time spent in space and at the ISS accumulating nearly 1111 days in space over the course of five longduration missions on the ISS Expedition 17 3031 4445 575859 and 697071 He also served as commander three times Expedition 31 5859 and 7071 Peggy Whitson of NASA and Axiom Space has spent the most time in space of any American accumulating over 675 days in space during her time on Expeditions 5 16 and 505152 and Axiom Mission 2 Private flights Travellers who pay for their own passage into space are termed spaceflight participants by Roscosmos and NASA and are sometimes referred to as space tourists a term they generally dislike As of June 2023 thirteen space tourists have visited the ISS nine were transported to the ISS on Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four were transported on American SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft For onetourist missions when professional crews change over in numbers not divisible by the three seats in a Soyuz and a shortstay crewmember is not sent the spare seat is sold by MirCorp through Space Adventures Space tourism was halted in 2011 when the Space Shuttle was retired and the stations crew size was reduced to six as the partners relied on Russian transport seats for access to the station Soyuz flight schedules increased after 2013 allowing five Soyuz flights 15 seats with only two expeditions 12 seats required The remaining seats were to be sold for around US40 million each to members of the public who could pass a medical exam ESA and NASA criticised private spaceflight at the beginning of the ISS and NASA initially resisted training Dennis Tito the first person to pay for his own passage to the ISS Anousheh Ansari became the first selffunded woman to fly to the ISS as well as the first Iranian in space Officials reported that her education and experience made her much more than a tourist and her performance in training had been excellent She did Russian and European studies involving medicine and microbiology during her 10day stay The 2009 documentary Space Tourists follows her journey to the station where she fulfilled an ageold dream of man to leave our planet as a normal person and travel into outer space In 2008 spaceflight participant Richard Garriott placed a geocache aboard the ISS during his flight This is currently the only nonterrestrial geocache in existence At the same time the Immortality Drive an electronic record of eight digitised human DNA sequences was placed aboard the ISS After a 12year hiatus the first two wholly space tourismdedicated private spaceflights to the ISS were undertaken Soyuz MS20 launched in December 2021 carrying visiting Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin and two Japanese space tourists under the aegis of the private company Space Adventures in April 2022 the company Axiom Space chartered a SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft and sent its own employee astronaut Michael LopezAlegria and three space tourists to the ISS for Axiom Mission 1 followed in May 2023 by one more tourist John Shoffner alongside employee astronaut Peggy Whitson and two Saudi astronauts for the Axiom Mission 2 Fleet operations Various crewed and uncrewed spacecraft have supported the stations activities Flights to the ISS include 37 Space Shuttle 90 Progress 71 Soyuz 5 ATV 9 HTV 2 Boeing Starliner 45 SpaceX Dragon and 20 Cygnus missions There are currently eight docking ports for visiting spacecraft with four additional ports installed but not yet put into service Harmony forward with PMA 2 IDA 2 Harmony zenith with PMA 3 IDA 3 Harmony nadir CBM port Unity nadir CBM port Prichal aft Prichal forward Prichal nadir Prichal port Prichal starboard Poisk zenith Rassvet nadir Zvezda aft Forward ports are at the front of the station according to its normal direction of travel and orientation attitude Aft is at the rear of the station Nadir is Earth facing zenith faced away from Earth Port is to the left if pointing ones feet towards the Earth and looking in the direction of travel and starboard is to the right Cargo spacecraft that will perform an orbital reboost of the station will typically dock at an aft forward or nadirfacing port Crewed As of 24 October 2024 281 people representing 23 countries had visited the space station many of them multiple times The United States has sent 167 people Russia has 61 Japan has sent 11 Canada has sent nine Italy has sent six France and Germany have each sent four Saudi Arabia Sweden and the United Arab Emirates have each sent two and there has been one person from Belarus Belgium Brazil Denmark Israel Kazakhstan Malaysia Netherlands South Africa South Korea Spain Turkey and the United Kingdom Uncrewed Uncrewed spaceflights are made primarily to deliver cargo however several Russian modules have also docked to the outpost following uncrewed launches Resupply missions typically use the Russian Progress spacecraft former European ATVs Japanese Kounotori vehicles and the American Dragon and Cygnus spacecraft Currently dockedberthed All dates are UTC Departure dates are the earliest possible NET and may change Scheduled missions All dates are UTC Launch dates are the earliest possible NET and may change Docking and berthing of spacecraft The Russian spacecraft and can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention Once within approximately 200 kilometres 120 mi the spacecraft begins receiving radio signals from the Kurs docking navigation system on the station As the spacecraft nears the station laserbased optical equipment precisely aligns the craft with the docking port and controls the final approach While the crew on the ISS and spacecraft monitor the procedure their role is primarily supervisory with intervention limited to issuing abort commands in emergencies Although initial development costs were substantial the systems reliability and standardized components have yielded significant cost reductions for subsequent missions The American SpaceX Dragon 2 cargo and crewed spacecraft can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention However on crewed Dragon missions the astronauts have the capability to intervene and fly the vehicle manually Other automated cargo spacecraft typically use a semiautomated process when arriving and departing from the station These spacecraft are instructed to approach and park near the station Once the crew on board the station is ready the spacecraft is commanded to come close to the station so that it can be grappled by an astronaut using the Mobile Servicing System robotic arm The final mating of the spacecraft to the station is achieved using the robotic arm a process known as berthing Spacecraft using this semiautomated process include the American Cygnus and the Japanese HTVX The nowretired American SpaceX Dragon 1 European ATV and Japanese HTV also used this process Launch and docking windows Prior to a spacecrafts docking to the ISS navigation and attitude control GNC is handed over to the ground control of the spacecrafts country of origin GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes The solar panels of the station are turned edgeon to the incoming spacecraft so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells Before its retirement Shuttle launches were often given priority over Soyuz with occasional priority given to Soyuz arrivals carrying crew and timecritical cargoes such as biological experiment materials Repairs Orbital Replacement Units ORUs are spare parts that can be readily replaced when a unit either passes its design life or fails Examples of ORUs are pumps storage tanks controller boxes antennas and battery units Some units can be replaced using robotic arms Most are stored outside the station either on small pallets called ExPRESS Logistics Carriers ELCs or share larger platforms called External Stowage Platforms ESPs which also hold science experiments Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating The larger logistics carriers also have local area network LAN connections for telemetry to connect experiments A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORUs occurred around 2011 before the end of the NASA shuttle programme as its commercial replacements Cygnus and Dragon carry one tenth to one quarter the payload Unexpected problems and failures have impacted the stations assembly timeline and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and in some cases could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004 the venting of fumes from an Elektron oxygen generator in 2006 and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during STS117 that left the station without thruster Elektron Vozdukh and other environmental control system operations In the latter case the root cause was found to be condensation inside electrical connectors leading to a short circuit During STS120 in 2007 and following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays it was noted during unfurling that the solar array had torn and was not deploying properly An EVA was carried out by Scott Parazynski assisted by Douglas Wheelock Extra precautions were taken to reduce the risk of electric shock as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint SARJ which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station Excessive vibration and highcurrent spikes in the array drive motor were noted resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood Inspections during EVAs on STS120 and STS123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic bearing surfaces so the joint was locked to prevent further damage Repairs to the joints were carried out during STS126 with lubrication and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint In September 2008 damage to the S1 radiator was first noticed in Soyuz imagery The problem was initially not thought to be serious The imagery showed that the surface of one subpanel had peeled back from the underlying central structure possibly because of micrometeoroid or debris impact On 15 May 2009 the damaged radiator panels ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computercontrolled closure of a valve The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008 but its effect if any has not been determined In the early hours of 1 August 2010 a failure in cooling Loop A starboard side one of two external cooling loops left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid Several subsystems including two of the four CMGs were shut down Planned operations on the ISS were interrupted through a series of EVAs to address the cooling system issue A first EVA on 7 August 2010 to replace the failed pump module was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quickdisconnects A second EVA on 11 August removed the failed pump module A third EVA was required to restore Loop A to normal functionality The USOSs cooling system is largely built by the US company Boeing which is also the manufacturer of the failed pump The four Main Bus Switching Units MBSUs located in the S0 truss control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the ISS Each MBSU has two power channels that feed 160V DC from the arrays to two DCtoDC power converters DDCUs that supply the 124V power used in the station In late 2011 MBSU1 ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health While still routing power correctly it was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA A spare MBSU was already on board but a 30 August 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before the electrical connection was secured The loss of MBSU1 limited the station to 75 of its normal power capacity requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem could be addressed On 5 September 2012 in a second sixhour EVA astronauts Sunita Williams and Akihiko Hoshide successfully replaced MBSU1 and restored the ISS to 100 power On 24 December 2013 astronauts installed a new ammonia pump for the stations cooling system The faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month halting many of the stations science experiments Astronauts had to brave a mini blizzard of ammonia while installing the new pump It was only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in NASA history Mission control centres The components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at mission control centres across the globe primarily the Christopher C Kraft Jr Mission Control Center in Houston and the RKA Mission Control Center TsUP in Moscow with support from Tsukuba Space Center in Japan Payload Operations and Integration Center in Huntsville Alabama US Columbus Control Center in Munich Germany and Mobile Servicing System Control at the Canadian Space Agencys headquarters in SaintHubert Quebec Life aboard Living quarters The living and working space on the International Space Station is larger than a sixbedroom house complete with seven sleeping quarters two bathrooms a gym and a 360degree view bay window Crew activities A typical day for the crew begins with a wakeup at 0600 followed by postsleep activities and a morning inspection of the station The crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with Mission Control before starting work at around 0810 The first scheduled exercise of the day follows after which the crew continues work until 1305 Following a onehour lunch break the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its presleep activities beginning at 1930 including dinner and a crew conference The scheduled sleep period begins at 2130 In general the crew works ten hours per day on a weekday and five hours on Saturdays with the rest of the time their own for relaxation or work catchup The time zone used aboard the ISS is Coordinated Universal Time UTC The windows are covered during night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets per day During visiting Space Shuttle missions the ISS crew mostly follow the shuttles Mission Elapsed Time MET which is a flexible time zone based on the launch time of the Space Shuttle mission The station provides crew quarters for each member of the expeditions crew with two sleep stations in the Zvezda one in Nauka and four more installed in Harmony The USOS quarters are private approximately personsized soundproof booths The ROS crew quarters in Zvezda include a small window but provide less ventilation and sound proofing A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag listen to music use a laptop and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the modules walls The module also provides a reading lamp a shelf and a desktop Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated otherwise astronauts can wake up oxygendeprived and gasping for air because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads During various station activities and crew rest times the lights in the ISS can be dimmed switched off and colour temperatures adjusted Reflection and material culture Reflection of individual and crew characteristics are found particularly in the decoration of the station and expressions in general such as religion The latter has produced a certain material economy between the station and Russia in particular The microsociety of the station as well as wider society and possibly the emergence of distinct station cultures is being studied by analyzing many aspects from art to dust accumulation as well as archaeologically how material of the ISS has been discarded Food and personal hygiene On the USOS most of the food aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags cans are rare because they are heavy and expensive to transport Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew and taste is reduced in microgravity so efforts are taken to make the food more palatable including using more spices than in regular cooking The crew looks forward to the arrival of any spacecraft from Earth as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs and liquid condiments are preferred over solid to avoid contaminating station equipment Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them in the galley which has two food warmers a refrigerator added in November 2008 and a water dispenser that provides heated and unheated water Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws while solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away Any food that floats away including crumbs must be collected to prevent it from clogging the stations air filters and other equipment Showers on space stations were introduced in the early 1970s on Skylab and Salyut 3 139 By Salyut 6 in the early 1980s the crew complained of the complexity of showering in space which was a monthly activity The ISS does not feature a shower instead crewmembers wash using a water jet and wet wipes with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tubelike container Crews are also provided with rinseless shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water There are two space toilets on the ISS both of Russian design located in Zvezda and Tranquility These Waste and Hygiene Compartments use a fandriven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System Astronauts first fasten themselves to the toilet seat which is equipped with springloaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal A lever operates a powerful fan and a suction hole slides open the air stream carries the waste away Solid waste is collected in individual bags which are stored in an aluminium container Full containers are transferred to Progress spacecraft for disposal Liquid waste is evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet with anatomically correct urine funnel adapters attached to the tube so that men and women can use the same toilet The diverted urine is collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System where it is recycled into drinking water In 2021 the arrival of the Nauka module also brought a third toilet to the ISS Crew health and safety Overall On 12 April 2019 NASA reported medical results from the Astronaut Twin Study Astronaut Scott Kelly spent a year in space on the ISS while his identical twin spent the year on Earth Several longlasting changes were observed including those related to alterations in DNA and cognition when one twin was compared with the other In November 2019 researchers reported that astronauts experienced serious blood flow and clot problems while on board the ISS based on a sixmonth study of 11 healthy astronauts The results may influence longterm spaceflight including a mission to the planet Mars according to the researchers Radiation The ISS is partially protected from the space environment by Earths magnetic field From an average distance of about 70000 km 43000 mi from the Earths surface depending on Solar activity the magnetosphere begins to deflect solar wind around Earth and the space station Solar flares are still a hazard to the crew who may receive only a few minutes warning In 2005 during the initial proton storm of an X3 class solar flare the crew of Expedition 10 took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the ROS designed for this purpose Subatomic charged particles primarily protons from cosmic rays and solar wind are normally absorbed by Earths atmosphere When they interact in sufficient quantity their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora Outside Earths atmosphere ISS crews are exposed to approximately one millisievert each day about a years worth of natural exposure on Earth resulting in a higher risk of cancer Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA and chromosomes of lymphocytes being central to the immune system any damage to these cells could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts Protective shielding and medications may lower the risks to an acceptable level Radiation levels on the ISS are between 12 and 288 milli rads per day about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew as Earths electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other types of radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere For example on a 12hour flight an airline passenger would experience 01 millisieverts of radiation or a rate of 02 millisieverts per day this is one fifth the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO Additionally airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight while the ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay on board the station Stress There is considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance Cosmonaut Valery Ryumin wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board the Salyut 6 space station All the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 55 m 6 m and leave them together for two months NASAs interest in psychological stress caused by space travel initially studied when their crewed missions began was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space station Mir Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS such as when the mother of NASA astronaut Daniel Tani died in a car accident and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language Firstgeneration space stations had crews who spoke a single language second and thirdgeneration stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages Astronauts must speak English and Russian and knowing additional languages is even better Due to the lack of gravity confusion often occurs Even though there is no up and down in space some crew members feel like they are oriented upside down They may also have difficulty measuring distances This can cause problems like getting lost inside the space station pulling switches in the wrong direction or misjudging the speed of an approaching vehicle during docking Medical The physiological effects of longterm weightlessness include muscle atrophy deterioration of the skeleton osteopenia fluid redistribution a slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass and puffiness of the face Sleep is regularly disturbed on the ISS because of mission demands such as incoming or departing spacecraft Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high The atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon naturally so fans are required at all times to process the air which would stagnate in the freefall zeroG environment To prevent some of the adverse effects on the body the station is equipped with two TVIS treadmills including the COLBERT the ARED Advanced Resistive Exercise Device which enables various weightlifting exercises that add muscle without raising or compensating for the astronauts reduced bone density and a stationary bicycle Each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill Microbiological environmental hazards Hazardous molds that can foul air and water filters may develop aboard space stations They can produce acids that degrade metal glass and rubber They can also be harmful to the crews health Microbiological hazards have led to a development of the LOCADPTS a portable test system which identifies common bacteria and molds faster than standard methods of culturing which may require a sample to be sent back to Earth Researchers in 2018 reported after detecting the presence of five Enterobacter bugandensis bacterial strains on the ISS none of which are pathogenic to humans that microorganisms on the ISS should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts Contamination on space stations can be prevented by reduced humidity and by using paint that contains moldkilling chemicals as well as the use of antiseptic solutions All materials used in the ISS are tested for resistance against fungi Since 2016 a series of ESAsponsored experiments have been conducted to test the antibacterial properties of various materials with the goal of developing smart surfaces that mitigate bacterial growth in multiple ways using the best method for a particular circumstance Dubbed Microbial Aerosol Tethering on Innovative Surfaces MATISS the programme involves deployment of small plaques containing an array of glass squares covered with different test coatings They remain on the station for six months before being returned to earth for analysis The most recent and final experiment of the series was launched on 5 June 2023 aboard the SpaceX CRS28 cargo mission to ISS comprising four plaques Whereas previous experiments in the series were limited to analysis by light microsocopy this experiment uses quartz glass made of pure silica which will allow spectrographic analysis Two of the plaques were returned after eight months and the remaining two after 16 months In April 2019 NASA reported that a comprehensive study had been conducted into the microorganisms and fungi present on the ISS The experiment was performed over a period of 14 months on three different flight missions and involved taking samples from 8 predefined locations inside the station then returning them to earth for analysis In prior experiments analysis was limited to culturebased methods thus overlooking microbes which cannot be grown in culture The present study used molecularbased methods in addition to culturing resulting in a more complete catalog The results may be useful in improving the health and safety conditions for astronauts as well as better understanding other closedin environments on Earth such as clean rooms used by the pharmaceutical and medical industries Noise Space flight is not inherently quiet with noise levels exceeding acoustic standards as far back as the Apollo missions For this reason NASA and the International Space Station international partners have developed noise control and hearing loss prevention goals as part of the health program for crew members Specifically these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel MMOP Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations The effort includes contributions from acoustical engineers audiologists industrial hygienists and physicians who comprise the subgroups membership from NASA Roscosmos the European Space Agency ESA the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA and the Canadian Space Agency CSA When compared to terrestrial environments the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration rarely reaching 85 dBA But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day seven days a week with current missions averaging six months in duration These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication as well as reduced alarm audibility Over the 19 plus year history of the ISS significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS During design and preflight activities members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements consulted to design and choose the quietest available payloads and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch 573 During spaceflights the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS modules in flight sound levels produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers absorptive materials noise barriers and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels Moreover when pumps fans and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies significantly reducing ambient noise levels NASA has adopted mostconservative damage risk criteria based on recommendations from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the World Health Organization in order to protect all crew members The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying or modifying terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits One innovative approach has been NASAs Noise Exposure Estimation Tool NEET in which noise exposures are calculated in a taskbased approach to determine the need for hearing protection devices HPDs Guidance for use of HPDs either mandatory use or recommended is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory and posted for crew reference during their missions The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances applies engineering controls and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures Finally hearing thresholds are monitored onorbit during missions There have been no persistent missionrelated hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers JAXA CSA ESA NASA during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations or nearly 175000 work hours In 2020 the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the SafeInSound Award for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise Fire and toxic gases An onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards Ammonia is used in the external radiators of the station and could potentially leak into the pressurised modules Orbit environment debris and visibility Altitude and orbital inclination The ISS is currently maintained in a nearly circular orbit with a minimum mean altitude of 370 km 230 mi and a maximum of 460 km 290 mi in the centre of the thermosphere at an inclination of 516 degrees to Earths equator with an eccentricity of 0007 This orbit was selected because it is the lowest inclination that can be directly reached by Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome at 46 N latitude without overflying China or dropping spent rocket stages in inhabited areas It travels at an average speed of 28000 kilometres per hour 17000 mph and completes 155 orbits per day 93 minutes per orbit The stations altitude was allowed to fall around the time of each NASA shuttle flight to permit heavier loads to be transferred to the station After the retirement of the shuttle the nominal orbit of the space station was raised in altitude from about 350 km to about 400 km Other more frequent supply spacecraft do not require this adjustment as they are substantially higher performance vehicles Atmospheric drag reduces the altitude by about 2 km a month on average Orbital boosting can be performed by the stations two main engines on the Zvezda service module or Russian or European spacecraft docked to Zvezdas aft port The Automated Transfer Vehicle is constructed with the possibility of adding a second docking port to its aft end allowing other craft to dock and boost the station It takes approximately two orbits three hours for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed Maintaining ISS altitude uses about 75 tonnes of chemical fuel per annum at an annual cost of about 210 million The Russian Orbital Segment contains the Data Management System which handles Guidance Navigation and Control ROS GNC for the entire station Initially Zarya the first module of the station controlled the station until a short time after the Russian service module Zvezda docked and was transferred control Zvezda contains the ESA built DMSR Data Management System Using two faulttolerant computers FTC Zvezda computes the stations position and orbital trajectory using redundant Earth horizon sensors Solar horizon sensors as well as Sun and star trackers The FTCs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced faultmasking by majority voting Orientation Zvezda uses gyroscopes reaction wheels and thrusters to turn itself Gyroscopes do not require propellant instead they use electricity to store momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the stations movement The USOS has its own computercontrolled gyroscopes to handle its extra mass When gyroscopes saturate thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum In February 2005 during Expedition 10 an incorrect command was sent to the stations computer using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly this can result in a rare force fight where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart which itself has no thrusters Docked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting or during the installation of the S3S4 truss which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the stations electronics Orbital debris threats The low altitudes at which the ISS orbits are also home to a variety of space debris including spent rocket stages defunct satellites explosion fragments including materials from antisatellite weapon tests paint flakes slag from solid rocket motors and coolant released by USA nuclearpowered satellites These objects in addition to natural micrometeoroids are a significant threat Objects large enough to destroy the station can be tracked and therefore are not as dangerous as smaller debris Objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments from approximately 1 cm down to microscopic size number in the trillions Despite their small size some of these objects are a threat because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station Spacewalking crew in spacesuits are also at risk of suit damage and consequent exposure to vacuum Ballistic panels also called micrometeorite shielding are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems The type and thickness of these panels depend on their predicted exposure to damage The stations shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS On the USOS Whipple Shields are used The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1550 cmthick 059197 in aluminium a 10 cmthick 39 in intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel a ceramic fabric and an outer layer of stainless steel which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull thereby spreading the energy of impact On the ROS a carbon fibre reinforced polymer honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that with a screenvacuum thermal insulation covering and glass cloth over the top Space debris is tracked remotely from the ground and the station crew can be notified If necessary thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment can alter the stations orbital altitude avoiding the debris These Debris Avoidance Manoeuvres DAMs are not uncommon taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance Ten DAMs had been performed by the end of 2009 Usually an increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1 ms is used to raise the orbit by one or two kilometres If necessary the altitude can also be lowered although such a manoeuvre wastes propellant If a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their spacecraft in order to be able to evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris Partial station evacuations have occurred on 13 March 2009 28 June 2011 24 March 2012 16 June 2015 November 2021 and 27 June 2024 The November 2021 evacuation was caused by a Russian antisatellite weapon test NASA administrator Bill Nelson said it was unthinkable that Russia would endanger the lives of everyone on ISS including their own cosmonauts Visibility from Earth The ISS is visible in the sky to the naked eye as a visibly moving bright white dot when crossing the sky and being illuminated by the Sun during twilight the hours after sunset and before sunrise when the station remains sunlit outside of Earths shadow but the ground and sky are dark It crosses the skies at latitudes between the polar regions Depending on the path it takes across the sky the time it takes the station to move across the horizon or from one to the other may be short or up to 10 minutes while likely being only visible part of that time because of it moving into or out of Earths shadow It then returns around every 90 minutes with the time of the day that it crosses the sky shifting over the course of some weeks and therefore before returning to twilight and visible illumination Because of the size of its reflective surface area the ISS is the brightest artificial object in the sky excluding other satellite flares with an approximate maximum magnitude of 4 when in sunlight and overhead similar to Venus and a maximum angular size of 63 arcseconds Tools are provided by a number of websites such as HeavensAbove see Live viewing below as well as smartphone applications that use orbital data and the observers longitude and latitude to indicate when the ISS will be visible weather permitting where the station will appear to rise the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears either by setting below the horizon or entering into Earths shadow In November 2012 NASA launched its Spot the Station service which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town The station is visible from 95 of the inhabited land on Earth but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes Under specific conditions the ISS can be observed at night on five consecutive orbits Those conditions are 1 a midlatitude observer location 2 near the time of the solstice with 3 the ISS passing in the direction of the pole from the observer near midnight local time The three photos show the first middle and last of the five passes on 56 June 2014 Astrophotography Using a telescopemounted camera to photograph the station is a popular hobby for astronomers while using a mounted camera to photograph the Earth and stars is a popular hobby for crew The use of a telescope or binoculars allows viewing of the ISS during daylight hours Transits of the ISS in front of the Sun particularly during an eclipse and so the Earth Sun Moon and ISS are all positioned approximately in a single line are of particular interest for amateur astronomers International cooperation Involving five space programs and fifteen countries the International Space Station is the most politically and legally complex space exploration programme in history The 1998 Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement sets forth the primary framework for international cooperation among the parties A series of subsequent agreements govern other aspects of the station ranging from jurisdictional issues to a code of conduct among visiting astronauts Brazil was also invited to participate in the programme the only developing country to receive such an invitation Under the agreement framework Brazil was to provide six pieces of hardware and in exchange would receive ISS utilization rights However Brazil was unable to deliver any of the elements due to a lack of funding and political priority within the country Brazil officially dropped out of the ISS programme in 2007 Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine continued cooperation between Russia and other countries on the International Space Station has been put into question Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin insinuated that Russian withdrawal could cause the International Space Station to deorbit due to lack of reboost capabilities writing in a series of tweets If you block cooperation with us who will save the ISS from an unguided deorbit to impact on the territory of the US or Europe Theres also the chance of impact of the 500ton construction in India or China Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect The ISS doesnt fly over Russia so all the risk is yours Are you ready for it This latter claim is untrue the ISS flies over all parts of the Earth between 516 degrees latitude north and south approximately the latitude of Saratov Rogozin later tweeted that normal relations between ISS partners could only be restored once sanctions have been lifted and indicated that Roscosmos would submit proposals to the Russian government on ending cooperation NASA stated that if necessary US corporation Northrop Grumman has offered a reboost capability that would keep the ISS in orbit On 26 July 2022 Yury Borisov Rogozins successor as head of Roscosmos submitted to Russian President Putin plans for withdrawal from the programme after 2024 However Robyn Gatens the NASA official in charge of the space station responded that NASA had not received any formal notices from Roscosmos concerning withdrawal plans Participating countries Canada European Space Agency Belgium Denmark France Germany Italy Netherlands Norway Spain Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom Japan Russia United States End of mission Originally the ISS was planned to be a 15year mission Therefore an end of mission had been worked on but was several times postponed due to the success and support for the operation of the station As a result the oldest modules of the ISS have been in orbit for more than 20 years with their reliability having decreased It has been proposed to use funds instead elsewhere for example for a return to the Moon According to the Outer Space Treaty the parties are legally responsible for all spacecraft or modules they launch An unmaintained station would pose an orbital and reentry hazard Russia has stated that it plans to pull out of the ISS program after 2025 However Russian modules will provide orbital stationkeeping until 2028 The US planned in 2009 to deorbit the ISS in 2016 But on 30 September 2015 Boeings contract with NASA as prime contractor for the ISS was extended to 30 September 2020 Part of Boeings services under the contract related to extending the stations primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028 In July 2018 the Space Frontier Act of 2018 was intended to extend operations of the ISS to 2030 This bill was unanimously approved in the Senate but failed to pass in the US House In September 2018 the Leading Human Spaceflight Act was introduced with the intent to extend operations of the ISS to 2030 and was confirmed in December 2018 Congress later passed similar provisions in its CHIPS and Science Act signed into law by US President Joe Biden on 9 August 2022 If until 2031 Commercial LEO Destinations providers are not sufficient to accommodate NASAs projects NASA is suggesting to extend ISS operations beyond 2031 NASAs disposal plans NASA considered originally several possible disposal options natural orbital decay with random reentry as with Skylab boosting the station to a higher altitude which would delay reentry and a controlled deorbit targeting a remote ocean area NASA determined that random reentry carried an unacceptable risk of producing hazardous space debris that could hit people or property and reboosting the station would be costly and could also create hazards Prior to 2010 plans had contemplated using a slightly modified Progress spacecraft to deorbit the ISS However NASA concluded Progress would not be adequate for the job and decided on a spacecraft specifically designed for the job In January 2022 NASA announced a planned date of January 2031 to deorbit the ISS using the US Deorbit Vehicle and direct any remnants into a remote area of the South Pacific Ocean that has come to be known as the spacecraft cemetery NASA plans to launch the deorbit vehicle in 2030 docking at the Harmony forward port The deorbit vehicle will remain attached dormant for about a year as the stations orbit naturally decays to 220 km 140 mi The spacecraft would then conduct one or more orientation burns to lower the perigee to 150 km 93 mi followed by a final deorbiting burn NASA began planning for the deorbit vehicle after becoming wary of Russia pulling out of the ISS abruptly leaving the other partners with few good options for a controlled reentry In June 2024 NASA selected SpaceX to develop the US Deorbit Vehicle a contract potentially worth 843 million The vehicle will consist of an existing Cargo Dragon spacecraft which will be paired with a significantly lengthened trunk module which will be equipped with 46 Draco thrusters instead of the normal 16 and will carry 30000 kg 66000 lb of propellant nearly six times the normal load NASA is still working to secure all the necessary funding to build launch and operate the deorbit vehicle Post mission proposals and plans The followup to NASAs programstrategy is the Commercial LEO Destinations Program meant to allow private industry to build and maintain their own stations and NASA procuring access as a customer starting in 2028 Similarly the ESA has been seeking new private space stations to provide orbital services as well as retrieve materials from the ISS Currently Axiom Station is being planned to be assembled docked to the ISS as a segment of the ISS starting sometime after 2024 Additionally there even have been suggestions in the commercial space industry that the ISS could be converted to commercial operations after it is retired by government entities including turning it into a space hotel Russia previously has planned to use its orbital segment for the construction of its OPSEK station after the ISS is decommissioned The modules under consideration for removal from the current ISS included the Multipurpose Laboratory Module Nauka MLM launched in July 2021 and the other new Russian modules that are proposed to be attached to Nauka These newly launched modules would still be well within their useful lives in 2024 At the end of 2011 the Exploration Gateway Platform concept also proposed using leftover USOS hardware and Zvezda 2 as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the EarthMoon Lagrange points However the entire USOS was not designed for disassembly and will be discarded Western space industry has suggested in 2022 using the ISS as a platform to develop orbital salvage capacities by companies such as CisLunar Industries working on using space debris as fuel instead of plunging it into the ocean NASA has stated that by July 2024 it has not seen any viable proposals for reuse of the ISS or parts of it Cost The ISS has been described as the most expensive single item ever constructed As of 2010 the total cost was US150 billion This includes NASAs budget of 587 billion 8973 billion in 2021 dollars for the station from 1985 to 2015 Russias 12 billion Europes 5 billion Japans 5 billion Canadas 2 billion and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station estimated at 14 billion each or 504 billion in total Assuming 20000 persondays of use from 2000 to 2015 by two to sixperson crews each personday would cost 75 million less than half the inflationadjusted 196 million 55 million before inflation per personday of Skylab In culture The ISS has become an international symbol of human capabilities particularly human cooperation and science defining a cooperative international approach and period instead of a looming commercialized and militarized interplanetary world In film Beside numerous documentaries such as the IMAX documentaries Space Station 3D from 2002 or A Beautiful Planet from 2016 and films like Apogee of Fear 2012 and Yolki 5 2016 the ISS is the subject of feature films such as The Day After Tomorrow 2004 Love 2011 together with the Chinese station Tiangong 1 in Gravity 2013

    title: "Global financial crisis",
    originalContent:
      "The 20072008 financial crisis or the global financial crisis GFC was the most severe worldwide economic crisis since the 1929 Wall Street crash that began the Great Depression Causes of the crisis included predatory lending in the form of subprime mortgages to lowincome homebuyers and a resulting housing bubble excessive risktaking by global financial institutions and lack of regulatory oversight which culminated in a perfect storm that triggered the Great Recession which lasted from late 2007 to mid2009 The financial crisis began in early 2007 as mortgagebacked securities MBS tied to US real estate as well as a vast web of derivatives linked to those MBS collapsed in value Financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage reaching a climax with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15 2008 and a subsequent international banking crisis The prerequisites for the crisis were complex During the 1990s the US Congress had passed legislation intended to expand affordable housing through looser financing In 1999 parts of the GlassSteagall legislation passed in 1933 were repealed permitting institutions to mix lowrisk operations such as commercial banking and insurance with higherrisk operations such as investment banking and proprietary trading As the Federal Reserve Fed lowered the federal funds rate from 2000 to 2003 institutions increasingly targeted lowincome homebuyers largely belonging to racial minorities with highrisk loans this development went unattended by regulators As interest rates rose from 2004 to 2006 the cost of mortgages rose and the demand for housing fell causing property values to decline In early 2007 as more US mortgage holders began defaulting on their repayments subprime lenders went bankrupt culminating in April with the bankruptcy of New Century Financial As demand and prices continued to fall the contagion spread to worldwide credit markets by August and central banks began injecting liquidity By July 2008 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac companies which together owned or guaranteed half of the US housing market were on the verge of collapse the Housing and Economic Recovery Act enabled the government to take over and cover their combined 16 trillion debt on September 7 In response to the growing crisis governments around the world deployed massive bailouts of financial institutions and other monetary and fiscal policies to prevent a collapse of the global financial system After the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers the fourth largest US investment bank on September 15 the next day the Fed bailed out the American International Group the largest US insurance company and on September 25 the government seized Washington Mutual the largest savings and loan firm On October 3 Congress passed the 800 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act which authorized the Treasury Department to purchase troubled assets and bank stocks The Fed began a program of quantitative easing by buying treasury bonds and other assets such as MBS and the February 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act signed by newly elected President Barack Obama included a range of measures intended to preserve existing jobs and create new ones Combined the initiatives coupled with actions taken in other countries ended the worst of the Great Recession by mid2009 Assessments of the crisiss impact in the US vary but suggest that some 87 million jobs were lost causing unemployment to rise from 5 percent in 2007 to a high of 10 percent in October 2009 The percentage of citizens living in poverty rose from 125 percent in 2007 to 151 percent in 2010 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 53 percent between October 2007 and March 2009 and some estimates suggest that one in four households lost 75 percent or more of their net worth In 2010 the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed overhauling financial regulations It was opposed by many Republicans and it was weakened by the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018 The Basel III capital and liquidity standards were also adopted by countries around the world The recession was a significant factor in the 2010s European debt crisis Background The crisis sparked the Great Recession which at the time was the most severe global recession since the Great Depression It was also followed by the European debt crisis which began with a deficit in Greece in late 2009 and the 20082011 Icelandic financial crisis which involved the bank failure of all three of the major banks in Iceland and relative to the size of its economy was the largest economic collapse suffered by any country in history It was among the five worst financial crises the world had experienced and led to a loss of more than 2 trillion from the global economy US home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46 during the 1990s to 73 during 2008 reaching 105 146 trillion in 2023 trillion The increase in cash out refinancings as home values rose fueled an increase in consumption that could no longer be sustained when home prices declined Many financial institutions owned investments whose value was based on home mortgages such as mortgagebacked securities or credit derivatives used to insure them against failure which declined in value significantly The International Monetary Fund estimated that large US and European banks lost more than 1 trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from January 2007 to September 2009 Lack of investor confidence in bank solvency and declines in credit availability led to plummeting stock and commodity prices in late 2008 and early 2009 The crisis rapidly spread into a global economic shock resulting in several bank failures Economies worldwide slowed during this period since credit tightened and international trade declined Housing markets suffered and unemployment soared resulting in evictions and foreclosures Several businesses failed From its peak in the second quarter of 2007 at 614 trillion household wealth in the United States fell 11 trillion to 504 trillion by the end of the first quarter of 2009 resulting in a decline in consumption then a decline in business investment In the fourth quarter of 2008 the quarteroverquarter decline in real GDP in the US was 84 The US unemployment rate peaked at 110 in October 2009 the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the precrisis rate The average hours per work week declined to 33 the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964 The economic crisis started in the US but spread to the rest of the world US consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007 and the rest of the world depended on the US consumer as a source of demand Toxic securities were owned by corporate and institutional investors globally Derivatives such as credit default swaps also increased the linkage between large financial institutions The deleveraging of financial institutions as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade Reductions in the growth rates of developing countries were due to falls in trade commodity prices investment and remittances sent from migrant workers example Armenia States with fragile political systems feared that investors from Western states would withdraw their money because of the crisis As part of national fiscal policy response to the Great Recession governments and central banks including the Federal Reserve the European Central Bank and the Bank of England provided thenunprecedented trillions of dollars in bailouts and stimulus including expansive fiscal policy and monetary policy to offset the decline in consumption and lending capacity avoid a further collapse encourage lending restore faith in the integral commercial paper markets avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral and provide banks with enough funds to allow customers to make withdrawals In effect the central banks went from being the lender of last resort to the lender of only resort for a significant portion of the economy In some cases the Fed was considered the buyer of last resort During the fourth quarter of 2008 these central banks purchased US25 347 trillion in 2023 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market and the largest monetary policy action in world history Following a model initiated by the 2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package the governments of European nations and the United States guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems ultimately purchasing 15 trillion newly issued preferred stock in major banks The Federal Reserve created thensignificant amounts of new currency as a method to combat the liquidity trap Bailouts came in the form of trillions of dollars of loans asset purchases guarantees and direct spending Significant controversy accompanied the bailouts such as in the case of the AIG bonus payments controversy leading to the development of a variety of decision making frameworks to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis Alistair Darling the UKs Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the crisis stated in 2018 that Britain came within hours of a breakdown of law and order the day that Royal Bank of Scotland was bailedout Instead of financing more domestic loans some banks instead spent some of the stimulus money in more profitable areas such as investing in emerging markets and foreign currencies In July 2010 the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in the United States to promote the financial stability of the United States The Basel III capital and liquidity standards were adopted worldwide Since the 2008 financial crisis consumer regulators in America have more closely supervised sellers of credit cards and home mortgages in order to deter anticompetitive practices that led to the crisis At least two major reports on the causes of the crisis were produced by the US Congress the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report released January 2011 and a report by the United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations entitled Wall Street and the Financial Crisis Anatomy of a Financial Collapse released April 2011 In total 47 bankers served jail time as a result of the crisis over half of which were from Iceland where the crisis was the most severe and led to the collapse of all three major Icelandic banks In April 2012 Geir Haarde of Iceland became the only politician to be convicted as a result of the crisis Only one banker in the United States served jail time as a result of the crisis Kareem Serageldin a banker at Credit Suisse who was sentenced to 30 months in jail and returned 246 million in compensation for manipulating bond prices to hide 1 billion of losses No individuals in the United Kingdom were convicted as a result of the crisis Goldman Sachs paid 550 million to settle fraud charges after allegedly anticipating the crisis and selling toxic investments to its clients With fewer resources to risk in creative destruction the number of patent applications was flat compared to exponential increases in patent application in prior years Typical American families did not fare well nor did the wealthybutnotwealthiest families just beneath the pyramids top However half of the poorest families in the United States did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis because they generally did not own financial investments whose value can fluctuate The Federal Reserve surveyed 4000 households between 2007 and 2009 and found that the total wealth of 63 of all Americans declined in that period and 77 of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth while only 50 of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease Timeline The following is a timeline of the major events of the financial crisis

Tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the Great Depression This matters for credit decisions A homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt They will draw on this equity rather than lose their car andor have a default placed on their credit record On the other hand a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk In the case of businesses their creditworthiness depends on their future profits Profit prospects look much worse in November 2008 than they did in November 2007 While many banks are obviously at the brink consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the

ratios limits on leverage narrowed the definition of capital to exclude subordinated debt limited counterparty risk and added liquidity requirements Critics argued that Basel III didnt address the problem of faulty riskweightings Major banks suffered losses from AAArated created by financial engineering which creates apparently riskfree assets out of high risk collateral that required less capital according to Basel II Lending to AArated sovereigns has a riskweight of zero thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis Johan Norberg argued that regulations Basel III among others have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments see European sovereigndebt crisis and the European Central Bank pursues even more lending as the solution November 3 2010 To improve economic growth the Federal Reserve announced another round of quantitative easing dubbed QE2 which included the purchase of 600 billion in longterm Treasuries over the following eight months Post2010 March 2011 Two years after the nadir of the crisis many stock market indices were 75 above their lows set in March 2009 Nevertheless the lack of fundamental changes in banking and financial

related to the issuance underwriting and sale of residential mortgagebacked securities In the table the names of emerging and developing economies are shown in boldface type while the names of developed economies are in Roman regular type Feds action towards crisis The expansion of central bank lending in response to the crisis was not only confined to the Federal Reserves provision of aid to individual financial institutions The Federal Reserve has also conducted a number of innovative lending programs with the goal of improving liquidity and strengthening different financial institutions and markets such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae In this case the major problem among the market is the lack of free cash reserves and flows to secure the loans The Federal Reserve took a number of steps to deal with worries about liquidity in the financial markets One of these steps was a credit line for major traders who act as the Feds partners in open market activities Also loan programs were set up to make the money market mutual funds and commercial paper market more flexible Also the Term AssetBacked Securities Loan Facility TALF was put in place thanks to a joint effort with the US Department of the Treasury This plan was meant to make it easier for consumers and businesses to get credit by giving Americans who owned highquality assetbacked securities more credit Before the crisis the Federal Reserves stocks of Treasury securities were sold to pay for the increase in credit This method was meant to keep banks from trying to give out their extra savings which could cause the federal funds rate to drop below where it was supposed to be However in October 2008 the Federal Reserve was granted the power to provide banks with interest payments on their surplus reserves This created a motivation for banks to retain their reserves instead of disbursing them so reducing the need for the Federal Reserve to hedge its increased lending by decreases in alternative assets Money market funds also went through runs when people lost faith in the market To keep it from getting worse the Fed said it would give money to mutual fund companies Also Department of Treasury said that it would briefly cover the assets of the fund Both of these things helped get the fund market back to normal which helped the commercial paper market which most businesses use to run The FDIC also did a number of things like raise the insurance cap from 100000 to 250000 to boost customer trust They engaged in Quantitative Easing which added more than 4 trillion to the financial system and got banks to start lending again both to each other and to people Many homeowners who were trying to keep their homes from going into default got housing credits A package of policies was passed that let borrowers refinance their loans even though the value of their homes was less than what they still owed on their mortgages Causes While the causes of the bubble and subsequent crash are disputed the precipitating factor for the Financial Crisis of 20072008 was the bursting of the United States housing bubble and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis which occurred due to a high default rate and resulting foreclosures of mortgage loans particularly adjustablerate mortgages Some or all of the following factors contributed to the crisis In its January 2011 report the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission FCIC a committee of US congressmen concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision including the Federal Reserves failure to stem the tide of toxic assets dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk a combination of excessive borrowing risky investments and lack of transparency by financial institutions and by households that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis ill preparation and inconsistent action by government and key policy makers lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw that added to the uncertainty and panic a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics at all levels collapsing mortgagelending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline deregulation of overthecounter derivatives especially credit default swaps the failures of credit rating agencies to correctly price risk Wall Street and the Financial Crisis Anatomy of a Financial Collapse known as the LevinCoburn Report by the United States Senate concluded that the crisis was the result of high risk complex financial products undisclosed conflicts of interest the failure of regulators the credit rating agencies and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street The high delinquency and default rates by homeowners particularly those with subprime credit led to a rapid devaluation of mortgagebacked securities including bundled loan portfolios derivatives and credit default swaps As the value of these assets plummeted buyers for these securities evaporated and banks who were heavily invested in these assets began to experience a liquidity crisis Securitization a process in which many mortgages were bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called mortgagebacked securities allowed for shifting of risk and lax underwriting standards These bundles could be sold as ostensibly lowrisk securities partly because they were often backed by credit default swap insurance Because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages and the associated risks on in this way they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria Lax regulation allowed predatory lending in the private sector especially after the federal government overrode antipredatory state laws in 2004 The Community Reinvestment Act CRA a 1977 US federal law designed to help low and moderateincome Americans get mortgage loans required banks to grant mortgages to higher risk families Granted in 2009 Federal Reserve economists found that only a small portion of subprime mortgage originations related to the CRA and that CRArelated loans appeared to perform comparably to other types of subprime loans These findings run counter to the contention that the CRA contributed in any substantive way to the mortgage crisis Reckless lending by lenders such as Bank of Americas Countrywide Financial unit was increasingly incentivized and even mandated by government regulation This may have caused Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to lose market share and to respond by lowering their own standards Mortgage guarantees by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac quasigovernment agencies which purchased many subprime loan securitizations The implicit guarantee by the US federal government created a moral hazard and contributed to a glut of risky lending Government policies that encouraged home ownership providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers compensation structures by banks and mortgage originators that prioritize shortterm deal flow over longterm value creation and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making The 1999 GrammLeachBliley Act which partially repealed the GlassSteagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States and increased speculation on the part of depository banks Credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the financial risk involved with mortgage loanrelated financial products and governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address changes in financial markets Variations in the cost of borrowing Fair value accounting was issued as US accounting standard SFAS 157 in 2006 by the privately run Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBdelegated by the SEC with the task of establishing financial reporting standards This required that tradable assets such as mortgage securities be valued according to their current market value rather than their historic cost or some future expected value When the market for such securities became volatile and collapsed the resulting loss of value had a major financial effect upon the institutions holding them even if they had no immediate plans to sell them Easy availability of credit in the US fueled by large inflows of foreign funds after the 1998 Russian financial crisis and 1997 Asian financial crisis of the 19971998 period led to a housing construction boom and facilitated debtfinanced consumer spending As banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners housing prices began to rise Lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the real estate bubble Loans of various types eg mortgage credit card and auto were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load As part of the housing and credit booms the number of mortgagebacked securities MBS and collateralized debt obligations CDO which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices greatly increased Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors to invest in the US housing market As housing prices declined these investors reported significant losses Falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loans providing borrowers with a financial incentive to enter foreclosure Foreclosure levels were elevated until early 2014 drained significant wealth from consumers losing up to 42 trillion Defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy Total losses were estimated in the trillions of US dollars globally Financialization the increased use of leverage in the financial system Financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds as well as certain differently regulated banks assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or losses These losses affected the ability of financial institutions to lend slowing economic activity Some critics contend that government mandates forced banks to extend loans to borrowers previously considered uncreditworthy leading to increasingly lax underwriting standards and high mortgage approval rates These in turn led to an increase in the number of homebuyers which drove up housing prices This appreciation in value led many homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes as an apparent windfall leading to overleveraging Subprime lending The relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks allowed for a significant increase in subprime lending Subprime had not become less risky Wall Street just accepted this higher risk Due to competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers In the view of some analysts the relatively conservative governmentsponsored enterprises GSEs policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003 However as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated The riskiest loans were originated in 20042007 the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs The GSEs eventually relaxed their standards to try to catch up with the private banks A contrarian view is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led the way to relaxed underwriting standards starting in 1995 by advocating the use of easytoqualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems by designing nodownpayment products issued by lenders by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as Countrywide Depending on how subprime mortgages are defined they remained below 10 of all mortgage originations until 2004 when they rose to nearly 20 and remained there through the 20052006 peak of the United States housing bubble Role of affordable housing programs The majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission written by the six Democratic appointees the minority report written by three of the four Republican appointees studies by Federal Reserve economists and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis Although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis they contend that GSE loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios In his dissent to the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission conservative American Enterprise Institute fellow Peter J Wallison stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by governmentsponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Based upon information in the SECs December 2011 securities fraud case against six former executives of Fannie and Freddie Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto estimated that in 2008 Fannie and Freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over 2 trillion In the early and mid2000s the Bush administration called numerous times for investigations into the safety and soundness of the GSEs and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages On September 10 2003 the United States House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight OFHEO that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities The hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked OFHEO for their attempt at regulation Some such as Wallison believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the US financial system that went unheeded A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that 467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act CRAcovered lenders into low and midlevel income LMI borrowers and neighborhoods representing 10 of all US mortgage lending during the period The majority of these were prime loans Subprime loans made by CRAcovered institutions constituted a 3 market share of LMI loans in 1998 but in the runup to the crisis fully 25 of all subprime lending occurred at CRAcovered institutions and another 25 of subprime loans had some connection with CRA However most subprime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA especially in the years 20052006 leading up to the crisis nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up subprime lending To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes in 1995 and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising and does not exonerate the CRA They contend that there were two connected causes to the crisis the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultralow interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11 2001 Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive totaling 45 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007 They also argue that the Federal Reserves classification of CRA loans as prime is based on the faulty and selfserving assumption that highinterestrate loans 3 percentage points over average equal subprime loans Others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude In an article in Portfolio magazine Michael Lewis spoke with one trader who noted that There werent enough Americans with bad credit taking out bad loans to satisfy investors appetite for the end product Essentially investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans using derivatives called credit default swaps collateralized debt obligations and synthetic CDOs By March 2011 the FDIC had paid out 9 billion c 12 billion in 2023 to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions The Congressional Budget Office estimated in June 2011 that the bailout to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac exceeds 300 billion c 401 billion in 2023 calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time Economist Paul Krugman argued in January 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that Fannie Mae Freddie Mac CRA or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis In other words bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes Countering Krugman Wallison wrote It is not true that every bubbleeven a large bubblehas the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates Wallison notes that other developed countries had large bubbles during the 19972007 period but the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 19972007 bubble deflated According to Wallison the reason the US residential housing bubble as opposed to other types of bubbles led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loansgenerally with low or no downpayments Krugmans contention that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that US housing policy was not the cause of the crisis is challenged by additional analysis After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis Xudong An and Anthony B Sanders reported in December 2010 We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS commercial mortgagebacked securities loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo reported The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006 Three years later commercial real estate started feeling the effects Denice A Gierach a real estate attorney and CPA wrote most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy In other words the borrowers did not cause the loans to go badit was the economy Growth of the housing bubble Between 1998 and 2006 the price of the typical American house increased by 124 During the 1980s and 1990s the national median home price ranged from 29 to 31 times median household income By contrast this ratio increased to 40 in 2004 and 46 in 2006 This housing bubble resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates or financing consumer spending by taking out second mortgages secured by the price appreciation In a Peabody Awardwinning program NPR correspondents argued that a Giant Pool of Money represented by 70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments sought higher yields than those offered by US Treasury bonds early in the decade This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with products such as the mortgagebacked security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies In effect Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the US with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them By approximately 2003 the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards The collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees This essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority Those securities first in line received investmentgrade ratings from rating agencies Securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested By September 2008 average US housing prices had declined by over 20 from their mid2006 peak As prices declined borrowers with adjustablerate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default During 2007 lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 13 million properties a 79 increase over 2006 This increased to 23 million in 2008 an 81 increase vs 2007 By August 2008 approximately 9 of all US mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure By September 2009 this had risen to 144 After the bubble burst Australian economist John Quiggin wrote And unlike the Great Depression this crisis was entirely the product of financial markets There was nothing like the postwar turmoil of the 1920s the struggles over gold convertibility and reparations or the SmootHawley tariff all of which have shared the blame for the Great Depression Instead Quiggin lays the blame for the 2008 nearmeltdown on financial markets on political decisions to lightly regulate them and on rating agencies which had selfinterested incentives to give good ratings Easy credit conditions Lower interest rates encouraged borrowing From 2000 to 2003 the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 65 to 10 This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dotcom bubble and the September 11 attacks as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation As early as 2002 it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the Fed needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble Moreover empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis Additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by rising US current account deficit which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006 Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke explained how trade deficits required the US to borrow money from abroad in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates Bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004 the US current account deficit increased by 650 billion from 15 to 58 of GDP Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad much of it from countries running trade surpluses These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oilexporting nations The balance of payments identity requires that a country such as the US running a current account deficit also have a capital account investment surplus of the same amount Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds capital flowed into the US to finance its imports All of this created demand for various types of financial assets raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates as high as 40 in China or because of high oil prices Ben Bernanke referred to this as a saving glut A flood of funds capital or liquidity reached the US financial markets Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing Treasury bonds and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis US households used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets Financial institutions invested foreign funds in mortgagebacked securities The Fed then raised the Fed funds rate significantly between July 2004 and July 2006 This contributed to an increase in oneyear and fiveyear adjustablerate mortgage ARM rates making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates and it became riskier to speculate in housing US housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst Weak and fraudulent underwriting practices Subprime lending standards declined in the US in early 2000 a subprime borrower had a FICO score of 660 or less By 2005 many lenders dropped the required FICO score to 620 making it much easier to qualify for prime loans and making subprime lending a riskier business Proof of income and assets were deemphasized Loans at first required full documentation then low documentation then no documentation One subprime mortgage product that gained wide acceptance was the no income no job no asset verification required NINJA mortgage Informally these loans were aptly referred to as liar loans because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process Testimony given to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission by whistleblower Richard M Bowen III on events during his tenure as the Business Chief Underwriter for Correspondent Lending in the Consumer Lending Group for Citigroup where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters suggests that by 2006 and 2007 the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic His testimony stated that by 2006 60 of mortgages purchased by Citigroup from some 1600 mortgage companies were defective were not underwritten to policy or did not contain all policyrequired documentsthis despite the fact that each of these 1600 originators was contractually responsible certified via representations and warrantees that its mortgage originations met Citigroup standards Moreover during 2007 defective mortgages from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to Citis standards increased to over 80 of production In separate testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission officers of Clayton Holdings the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the United States and Europe testified that Claytons review of over 900000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed that scarcely 54 of the loans met their originators underwriting standards The analysis conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks including 7 too big to fail banks additionally showed that 28 of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer Claytons analysis further showed that 39 of these loans ie those not meeting any issuers minimal underwriting standards were subsequently securitized and sold to investors Predatory lending Predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders enticing borrowers to enter into unsafe or unsound secured loans for inappropriate purposes In June 2008 Countrywide Financial was sued by then California Attorney General Jerry Brown for unfair business practices and false advertising alleging that Countrywide used deceptive tactics to push homeowners into complicated risky and expensive loans so that the company could sell as many loans as possible to thirdparty investors In May 2009 Bank of America modified 64000 Countrywide loans as a result When housing prices decreased homeowners in ARMs then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments since their home equity had disappeared This caused Countrywides financial condition to deteriorate ultimately resulting in a decision by the Office of Thrift Supervision to seize the lender One Countrywide employeewho would later plead guilty to two counts of wire fraud and spent 18 months in prisonstated that If you had a pulse we gave you a loan Former employees from Ameriquest which was United States leading wholesale lender described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to Wall Street banks eager to make fast profits There is growing evidence that such mortgage frauds may be a cause of the crisis Deregulation and lack of regulation According to Barry Eichengreen the roots of the financial crisis lay in the deregulation of financial markets A 2012 OECD study suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis In other cases laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system Key examples include Jimmy Carters Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 DIDMCA phased out several restrictions on banks financial practices broadened their lending powers allowed credit unions and savings and loans to offer checkable deposits and raised the deposit insurance limit from 40000 to 100000 thereby potentially lessening depositor scrutiny of lenders risk management policies In October 1982 US President Ronald Reagan signed into law the GarnSt Germain Depository Institutions Act which provided for adjustablerate mortgage loans began the process of banking deregulation and contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980searly 1990s In November 1999 US President Bill Clinton signed into law the GrammLeachBliley Act which repealed provisions of the GlassSteagall Act that prohibited a bank holding company from owning other financial companies The repeal effectively removed the separation that previously existed between Wall Street investment banks and depository banks providing a government stamp of approval for a universal risktaking banking model Investment banks such as Lehman became competitors with commercial banks Some analysts say that this repeal directly contributed to the severity of the crisis while others downplay its impact since the institutions that were greatly affected did not fall under the jurisdiction of the act itself In 2004 the US Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed the net capital rule which enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on fueling the growth in mortgagebacked securities supporting subprime mortgages The SEC conceded that selfregulation of investment banks contributed to the crisis Financial institutions in the shadow banking system are not subject to the same regulation as depository banks allowing them to assume additional debt obligations relative to their financial cushion or capital base This was the case despite the LongTerm Capital Management debacle in 1998 in which a highly leveraged shadow institution failed with systemic implications and was bailed out Regulators and accounting standardsetters allowed depository banks such as Citigroup to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities offbalance sheet into complex legal entities called structured investment vehicles masking the weakness of the capital base of the firm or degree of leverage or risk taken Bloomberg News estimated that the top four US banks will have to return between 500 billion and 1 trillion to their balance sheets during 2009 This increased uncertainty during the crisis regarding the financial position of the major banks Offbalance sheet entities were also used in the Enron scandal which brought down Enron in 2001 As early as 1997 Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan fought to keep the derivatives market unregulated With the advice of the Working Group on Financial Markets the US Congress and President Bill Clinton allowed the selfregulation of the overthecounter derivatives market when they enacted the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 Written by Congress with lobbying from the financial industry it banned the further regulation of the derivatives market Derivatives such as credit default swaps CDS can be used to hedge or speculate against particular credit risks without necessarily owning the underlying debt instruments The volume of CDS outstanding increased 100fold from 1998 to 2008 with estimates of the debt covered by CDS contracts as of November 2008 ranging from US33 to 47 trillion Total overthecounter OTC derivative notional value rose to 683 trillion by June 2008 Warren Buffett famously referred to derivatives as financial weapons of mass destruction in early 2003 A 2011 paper suggested that Canadas avoidance of a banking crisis in 2008 as well as in prior eras could be attributed to Canada possessing a single powerful overarching regulator while the United States had a weak crisis prone and fragmented banking system with multiple competing regulatory bodies Increased debt burden or overleveraging Prior to the crisis financial institutions became highly leveraged increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses Much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as offbalance sheet securitization and derivatives which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels US households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or overleveraged during the years preceding the crisis This increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn Key statistics include Free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from 627 billion in 2001 to 1428 billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built a total of nearly 5 trillion over the period contributing to economic growth worldwide US home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46 during the 1990s to 73 during 2008 reaching 105 trillion c 146 trillion in 2023 US household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was 127 at the end of 2007 versus 77 in 1990 In 1981 US private debt was 123 of GDP by the third quarter of 2008 it was 290 From 2004 to 2007 the top five US investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock Changes in capital requirements intended to keep US banks competitive with their European counterparts allowed lower risk weightings for AAArated securities The shift from firstloss tranches to AAArated tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage These five institutions reported over 41 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007 about 30 of US nominal GDP for 2007 Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at firesale prices and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation With the exception of Lehman these companies required or received government support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two US governmentsponsored enterprises owned or guaranteed nearly 5 trillion c 695 trillion in 2023 trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into conservatorship by the US government in September 2008 These seven entities were highly leveraged and had 9 trillion in debt or guarantee obligations yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks Behavior that may be optimal for an individual such as saving more during adverse economic conditions can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior as ultimately one persons consumption is another persons income Too many consumers attempting to save or pay down debt simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession Economist Hyman Minsky also described a paradox of deleveraging as financial institutions that have too much leverage debt relative to equity cannot all deleverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets In April 2009 Federal Reserve vicechair Janet Yellen discussed these paradoxes Once this massive credit crunch hit it didnt take long before we were in a recession The recession in turn deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell and credit losses of financial institutions surged Indeed we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy Consumers are pulling back on purchases especially on durable goods to build their savings Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash And financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm Once again Minsky understood this dynamic He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firmsand indeed essential to return the economy to a normal statenevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole Financial innovation and complexity The term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives such as offsetting a particular risk exposure such as the default of a borrower or to assist with obtaining financing Examples pertinent to this crisis included the adjustablerate mortgage the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgagebacked securities MBS or collateralized debt obligations CDO for sale to investors a type of securitization and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps CDS The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions CDO issuance grew from an estimated 20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over 180 billion by Q1 2007 then declined back under 20 billion by Q1 2008 Further the credit quality of CDOs declined from 2000 to 2007 as the level of subprime and other nonprime mortgage debt increased from 5 to 36 of CDO assets As described in the section on subprime lending the CDS and portfolio of CDS called synthetic CDO enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found For example buying a CDS to insure a CDO ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the CDO when those CDOs became worthless This boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage including mortgage brokers specialized originators the securitizers and their due diligence firms managing agents and trading desks and finally investors insurances and providers of repo funding With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information including FICO scores on creditworthiness appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts misjudgments and finally market collapse Economists have studied the crisis as an instance of cascades in financial networks where institutions instability destabilized other institutions and led to knockon effects Martin Wolf chief economics commentator at the Financial Times wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations such as offbalance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks stating an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decadethe offbalancesheet vehicles the derivatives and the shadow banking system itselfwas to find a way round regulation Incorrect pricing of risk Mortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years Limitations of default and prepayment models the heart of pricing models led to overvaluation of mortgage and assetbacked products and their derivatives by originators securitizers brokerdealers ratingagencies insurance underwriters and the vast majority of investors with the exception of certain hedge funds While financial derivatives and structured products helped partition and shift risk between financial participants it was the underestimation of falling housing prices and the resultant losses that led to aggregate risk For a variety of reasons market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system The pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system Banks estimated that 450 billion of CDO were sold between late 2005 to the middle of 2007 among the 102 billion of those that had been liquidated JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for high quality CDOs was approximately 32 cents on the dollar while the recovery rate for mezzanine capital CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar AIG insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted However AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008 US taxpayers provided over 180 billion in government loans and investments in AIG during 2008 and early 2009 through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions including many large global financial institutions The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission FCIC made the major government study of the crisis It concluded in January 2011 The Commission concludes AIG failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral setting aside capital reserves or hedging its exposurea profound failure in corporate governance particularly its risk management practices AIGs failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of overthecounter OTC derivatives including credit default swaps which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of AIGs failure The limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood This formula assumed that the price of CDS was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgagebacked securities Because it was highly tractable it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of CDO and CDS investors issuers and rating agencies According to one Wired article Then the model fell apart Cracks started appearing early on when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of Lis formula hadnt expected The cracks became fullfledged canyons in 2008when ruptures in the financial systems foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril Lis Gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees As financial assets became more complex and harder to value investors were reassured by the fact that the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators accepted as valid some complex mathematical models that showed the risks were much smaller than they actually were George Soros commented that The superboom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves Similarly the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products It was a shocking abdication of responsibility A conflict of interest between investment management professional and institutional investors combined with a global glut in investment capital led to bad investments by asset managers in overpriced credit assets Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management There is therefore an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in overpriced underyielding investments to the detriment of their clients so they could maintain their assets under management They supported this choice with a plausible deniability of the risks associated with subprimebased credit assets because the loss experience with early vintages of subprime loans was so low Despite the dominance of the above formula there are documented attempts of the financial industry occurring before the crisis to address the formula limitations specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events The volume Credit Correlation Life After Copulas published in 2007 by World Scientific summarizes a 2006 conference held by Merrill Lynch in London where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations See also the article by Donnelly and Embrechts and the book by Brigo Pallavicini and Torresetti that reports relevant warnings and research on CDOs appeared in 2006 Boom and collapse of the shadow banking system There is strong evidence that the riskiest worst performing mortgages were funded through the shadow banking system and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their underwriting standards and originate riskier loans In a June 2008 speech President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Timothy Geithnerwho in 2009 became United States Secretary of the Treasuryplaced significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a run on the entities in the parallel banking system also called the shadow banking system These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system but were not subject to the same regulatory controls Further these entities were vulnerable because of assetliability mismatch meaning that they borrowed shortterm in liquid markets to purchase longterm illiquid and risky assets This meant that disruptions in credit markets would force them to engage in rapid deleveraging selling their longterm assets at depressed prices He described the significance of these entities In early 2007 assetbacked commercial paper conduits in structured investment vehicles in auctionrate preferred securities tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes had a combined asset size of roughly 22 trillion Assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to 25 trillion Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly 18 trillion The combined balance sheets of the five largest investment banks totaled 4 trillion In comparison the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over 6 trillion and total assets of the entire banking system were about 10 trillion The combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to selfreinforcing asset price and credit cycles Economist Paul Krugman laureate of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences described the run on the shadow banking system as the core of what happened to cause the crisis He referred to this lack of controls as malign neglect and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all bankinglike activity Without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of mortgagebacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper investment banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations This meant that nearly onethird of the US lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into June 2009 According to the Brookings Institution at that time the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume The authors also indicate that some forms of securitization were likely to vanish forever having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions While traditional banks raised their lending standards it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that was the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing Commodity prices In a 2008 paper Ricardo J Caballero Emmanuel Farhi and PierreOlivier Gourinchas argued that the financial crisis was attributable to global asset scarcity which led to large capital flows toward the United States and to the creation of asset bubbles that eventually burst Caballero Farhi and Gourinchas argued that the sharp rise in oil prices following the subprime crisis nearly 100 percent in just a matter of months and on the face of recessionary shocks was the result of a speculative response to the financial crisis itself in an attempt to rebuild asset supply That is the global economy was subject to one shock with multiple implications rather than to two separate shocks financial and oil Longonly commodity index funds became popular by one estimate investment increased from 90 billion in 2006 to 200 billion at the end of 2007 while commodity prices increased 71 which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble The empirical research has been mixed The Globals Savings Glut The cause of the global asset bubble can be partially attributable to the global savings glut As theorized by Andrew Metrick the demand for safe assets following the Asian Financial Crisis coupled with the lack of circulating treasuries created an unmet demand for risk free assets Thus institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds and pension funds began purchasing synthetic safe assets like TripleA Mortgage Backed Securities As a consequence the demand for socalled safe assets fueled the free flow of capital into housing in the United States This greatly worsened the crisis as banks and other financial institutions were incentivized to issue more mortgages than before Systemic crisis of capitalism In a 1998 book John McMurtry suggested that a financial crisis is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself In his 1978 book The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism Ravi Batra suggests that growing inequality of financial capitalism produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes He also suggested that a demand gap related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments John Bellamy Foster a political economy analyst and editor of the Monthly Review believed that the decrease in GDP growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing market saturation Marxian economics followers Andrew Kliman Michael Roberts and Guglielmo Carchedi in contradistinction to the Monthly Review school represented by Foster pointed to capitalisms longterm tendency of the rate of profit to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally From this point of view the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets where there was potential for greater return on investment The speculative frenzy of the late 1990s and 2000s was in this view a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital expressed through the fall in the rate of profit According to Michael Roberts the fall in the rate of profit eventually triggered the credit crunch of 2007 when credit could no longer support profits In 2005 book The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism John C Bogle wrote that Corporate America went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long Echoing the central thesis of James Burnhams 1941 seminal book The Managerial Revolution Bogle cites issues including that managers capitalism replaced owners capitalism meaning management runs the firm for its benefit rather than for the shareholders a variation on the principalagent problem the burgeoning executive compensation the management of earnings mainly a focus on share price rather than the creation of genuine value and the failure of gatekeepers including auditors boards of directors Wall Street analysts and career politicians In his book The Big Mo Mark Roeder a former executive at the Swissbased UBS Bank suggested that largescale momentum or The Big Mo played a pivotal role in the financial crisis Roeder suggested that recent technological advances such as computerdriven trading programs together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets has magnified the momentum effect This has made the financial sector inherently unstable Robert Reich attributed the economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the United States particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80 of the workforce This stagnation forced the population to borrow to meet the cost of living Economists Ailsa McKay and Margunn Bjrnholt argued that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession and call for a reshaping of both the economy economic theory and the economics profession Wrong banking model resilience of credit unions A report by the International Labour Organization concluded that cooperative banking institutions were less likely to fail than their competitors during the crisis The cooperative banking sector had 20 market share of the European banking sector but accounted for only 7 of all the writedowns and losses between the third quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2011 In 2008 in the US the rate of commercial bank failures was almost triple that of credit unions and almost five times the credit union rate in 2010 Credit unions increased their lending to small and mediumsized businesses while overall lending to those businesses decreased Prediction by economists Economists particularly followers of mainstream economics mostly failed to predict the crisis The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvanias online business journal examined why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis and concluded that economists used mathematical models that failed to account for the critical roles that banks and other financial institutions as opposed to producers and consumers of goods and services play in the economy Several followers of heterodox economics predicted the crisis with varying arguments Dirk Bezemer credits 12 economists with predicting the crisis Dean Baker US Wynne Godley UK Fred Harrison UK Michael Hudson US Eric Janszen US Steve Keen Australia Jakob Broechner Madsen Jens Kjaer Srensen Denmark Med Jones US Kurt Richebcher US Nouriel Roubini US Peter Schiff US and Robert Shiller US Shiller a founder of the CaseShiller index that measures home prices wrote an article a year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in which he predicted that a slowing US housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst leading to financial collapse Peter Schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse The Austrian School regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable creditfueled bubble caused by laxity in monetary supply There were other economists that did warn of a pending crisis The former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the International Monetary Fund In 2005 at a celebration honoring Alan Greenspan who was about to retire as chairman of the US Federal Reserve Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector In that paper Rajan argued that disaster might loom Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but in return offer generous compensation the rest of the time These risks are known as tail risks But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialize financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimized Stock trader and financial risk engineer Nassim Nicholas Taleb author of the 2007 book The Black Swan spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of and reliance on bad risk models and reliance on forecasting and framed the problem as part of robustness and fragility He also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis They didnt listen so I took their money According to David Brooks from The New York Times Taleb not only has an explanation for whats happening he saw it coming Popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis For example an article in The New York Times noted that economist Nouriel Roubini warned of such crisis as early as September 2006 and stated that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions According to The Guardian Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession while The New York Times labelled him Dr Doom In a 2012 article in the journal Japan and the World Economy Andrew K Rose and Mark M Spiegel used a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause MIMIC model on a crosssection of 107 countries to evaluate potential causes of the 2008 crisis The authors examined various economic indicators ignoring contagion effects across countries The authors concluded We include over sixty potential causes of the crisis covering such categories as financial system policies and conditions asset price appreciation in real estate and equity markets international imbalances and foreign reserve adequacy macroeconomic policies and institutional and geographic features Despite the fact that we use a wide number of possible causes in a flexible statistical framework we are unable to link most of the commonly cited causes of the crisis to its incidence across countries This negative finding in the crosssection makes us skeptical of the accuracy of early warning systems of potential crises which must also predict their timing IndyMac The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern Californiabased IndyMac a spinoff of Countrywide Financial Before its failure IndyMac Bank was the largest savings and loan association in the Los Angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage loan originator in the United States The failure of IndyMac Bank on July 11 2008 was the fourth largest bank failure in United States history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift IndyMac Banks parent corporation was IndyMac Bancorp until the FDIC seized IndyMac Bank IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2008 IndyMac Bank was founded as Countrywide Mortgage Investment in 1985 by David S Loeb and Angelo Mozilo as a means of collateralizing Countrywide Financial loans too big to be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae In 1997 Countrywide spun off IndyMac as an independent company run by Mike Perry who remained its CEO until the downfall of the bank in July 2008 The primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing AltA loans on a large scale This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets From its inception as a savings association in 2000 IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States During 2006 IndyMac originated over 90 billion 131 billion in 2023 of mortgages IndyMacs aggressive growth strategy use of AltA and other nontraditional loan products insufficient underwriting credit concentrations in residential real estate in the California and Florida marketsstates alongside Nevada and Arizona where the housing bubble was most pronouncedand heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB and from brokered deposits led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007 IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrowers income or assets and to borrowers with poor credit histories Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well As an AltA lender IndyMacs business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrowers needs using an extensive array of risky optionadjustablerate mortgages option ARMs subprime loans 8020 loans and other nontraditional products Ultimately loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne Chief Risk Officer to the regulating agencies On May 12 2008 in the Capital section of its last 10Q IndyMac revealed that it may not be well capitalized in the future IndyMac reported that during April 2008 Moodys and Standard Poors downgraded the ratings on a significant number of Mortgagebacked security MBS bondsincluding 160 million 222 million in 2023 issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed its riskbased capital ratio as of June 30 2008 Had these lowered ratings been in effect on March 31 2008 IndyMac concluded that the banks capital ratio would have been 927 total riskbased IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below well capitalized minimum 10 riskbased capital ratio to adequately capitalized 810 riskbased capital ratio the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds Senator Charles Schumer DNY later pointed out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 of IndyMacs total deposits and ask the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits With 189 billion in total deposits reported on March 31 Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over 7 billion in brokered deposits While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at 500 million a month had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30 IndyMac was taking new measures to preserve capital such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities Dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008 after being cut in half the previous quarter The company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer IndyMac reported that the banks riskbased capital was only 47 million above the minimum required for this 10 mark But it did not reveal some of that 47 million 653 million in 2023 capital it claimed it had as of March 31 2008 was fabricated When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed IndyMac was forced to hold 107 billion 152 billion in 2023 of loans it could not sell in the secondary market Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew 155 billion 215 billion in 2023 or about 75 of IndyMacs deposits This bank run on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS The letter outlined the Senators concerns with IndyMac While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMacs demise the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound way it was operated On June 26 2008 Senator Charles Schumer DNY a member of the Senate Banking Committee chairman of Congress Joint Economic Committee and the thirdranking Democrat in the Senate released several letters he had sent to regulators in which he wasconcerned that IndyMacs financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers Some worried depositors began to withdraw money On July 7 2008 IndyMac announced on the company blog that it Had failed to raise capital since its May 12 2008 quarterly earnings report Had been notified by bank and thrift regulators that IndyMac Bank was no longer deemed wellcapitalized IndyMac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions halted new loan submissions and cut 3800 jobs On July 11 2008 citing liquidity concerns the FDIC put IndyMac Bank into conservatorship A bridge bank IndyMac Federal Bank FSB was established to assume control of IndyMac Banks assets its secured liabilities and its insured deposit accounts The FDIC announced plans to open IndyMac Federal Bank FSB on July 14 2008 Until then depositors would have access to their insured deposits through ATMs their existing checks and their existing debit cards Telephone and Internet account access was restored when the bank reopened The FDIC guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to US100000 and declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount guaranteeing 50 of any amounts in excess of 100000 Yet even with the pending sale of Indymac to IMB Management Holdings an estimated 10000 uninsured depositors of Indymac are still at a loss of over 270 million With 32 billion in assets IndyMac Bank was one of the largest bank failures in American history IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 31 2008 Initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as Northern Rock and Countrywide Financial as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets Over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008 Concerns that investment bank Bear Stearns would collapse in March 2008 resulted in its firesale to JP Morgan Chase The financial institution crisis hit its peak in September and October 2008 Several major institutions either failed were acquired under duress or were subject to government takeover These included Lehman Brothers Merrill Lynch Fannie Mae Freddie Mac Washington Mutual Wachovia Citigroup and AIG On October 6 2008 three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in US history Lehmans former CEO Richard S Fuld Jr found himself before Representative Henry A Waxman the California Democrat who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Fuld said he was a victim of the collapse blaming a crisis of confidence in the markets for dooming his firm Notable books and movies In 2006 Peter Schiff authored a book titled Crash Proof How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse which was published in February 2007 by Wiley The book describes various features of the economy and housing market that led to the United States housing bubble and warns of the impending decline After many of the predictions came to pass a second edition titled Crash Proof 20 was published in 2009 which included a 2009 update addendum

    title: "Eurozone crisis",
    originalContent:
      "The European debt crisis often also referred to as the eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis was a multiyear debt crisis that took place in the European Union EU from 2009 until the mid to late 2010s Several eurozone member states Greece Portugal Ireland and Cyprus were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out overindebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of other eurozone countries the European Central Bank ECB or the International Monetary Fund IMF The eurozone crisis was caused by a sudden stop of the flow of foreign capital into countries that had substantial current account deficits and were dependent on foreign lending The crisis was worsened by the inability of states to resort to devaluation reductions in the value of the national currency due to having the Euro as a shared currency Debt accumulation in some eurozone members was in part due to macroeconomic differences among eurozone member states prior to the adoption of the euro It also involved a process of debt market contagion The European Central Bank adopted an interest rate that incentivized investors in Northern eurozone members to lend to the South whereas the South was incentivized to borrow because interest rates were very low Over time this led to the accumulation of deficits in the South primarily by private economic actors A lack of fiscal policy coordination among eurozone member states contributed to imbalanced capital flows in the eurozone while a lack of financial regulatory centralization or harmonization among eurozone states coupled with a lack of credible commitments to provide bailouts to banks incentivized risky financial transactions by banks The detailed causes of the crisis varied from country to country In several countries private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies postbubble European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing The onset of crisis was in late 2009 when the Greek government disclosed that its budget deficits were far higher than previously thought Greece called for external help in early 2010 receiving an EUIMF bailout package in May 2010 European nations implemented a series of financial support measures such as the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF in early 2010 and the European Stability Mechanism ESM in late 2010 The ECB also contributed to solve the crisis by lowering interest rates and providing cheap loans of more than one trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between European banks On 6 September 2012 the ECB calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailoutprecautionary programme from EFSFESM through some yield lowering Outright Monetary Transactions OMT Ireland and Portugal received EUIMF bailouts In November 2010 and May 2011 respectively In March 2012 Greece received its second bailout Both Cyprus received rescue packages in June 2012 Return to economic growth and improved structural deficits enabled Ireland and Portugal to exit their bailout programmes in July 2014 Greece and Cyprus both managed to partly regain market access in 2014 Spain never officially received a bailout programme Its rescue package from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalisation fund and did not include financial support for the government itself The crisis had significant adverse economic effects and labour market effects with unemployment rates in Greece and Spain reaching 27 and was blamed for subdued economic growth not only for the entire eurozone but for the entire European Union The austerity policies implemented as a result of the crisis also produced a sharp rise in poverty levels and a significant increase in income inequality across Southern Europe It had a major political impact on the ruling governments in 10 out of 19 eurozone countries contributing to power shifts in Greece Ireland France Italy Portugal Spain Slovenia Slovakia Belgium and the Netherlands as well as outside of the eurozone in the United Kingdom Causes The eurozone crisis resulted from the structural problem of the eurozone and a combination of complex factors There is a consensus that the root of the eurozone crisis lay in a balanceofpayments crisis a sudden stop of foreign capital into countries that were dependent on foreign lending and that this crisis was worsened by the fact that states could not resort to devaluation reductions in the value of the national currency to make exports more competitive in foreign markets Other important factors include the globalisation of finance easy credit conditions during the 20022008 period that encouraged highrisk lending and borrowing practices the 20072008 financial crisis international trade imbalances real estate bubbles that have since burst the Great Recession of 20082012 fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses and approaches used by states to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses Macroeconomic divergence among eurozone member states led to imbalanced capital flows between the member states Despite different macroeconomic conditions the European Central Bank could only adopt one interest rate choosing one that meant that real interest rates in Germany were high relative to inflation and low in Southern eurozone member states This incentivized investors in Germany to lend to the South whereas the South was incentivized to borrow because interest rates were very low Over time this led to the accumulation of deficits in the South primarily by private economic actors Comparative political economy explains the fundamental roots of the European crisis in varieties of national institutional structures of member countries north vs south which conditioned their asymmetric development trends over time and made the union susceptible to external shocks Imperfections in the Eurozones governance construction to react effectively exacerbated macroeconomic divergence Eurozone member states could have alleviated the imbalances in capital flows and debt accumulation in the South by coordinating national fiscal policies Germany could have adopted more expansionary fiscal policies to boost domestic demand and reduce the outflow of capital and Southern eurozone member states could have adopted more restrictive fiscal policies to curtail domestic demand and reduce borrowing from the North Per the requirements of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty governments pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels However some of the signatories including Germany and France failed to stay within the confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts andor deficits sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques including inconsistent accounting offbalancesheet transactions and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures From late 2009 on after Greeces newly elected PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public and the government debt of several states was downgraded The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal while raising concerns about Italy Spain and the European banking system and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone The underreporting was exposed through a revision of the forecast for the 2009 budget deficit from 68 of GDP no greater than 3 of GDP was a rule of the Maastricht Treaty to 127 almost immediately after PASOK won the October 2009 Greek national elections Large upwards revision of budget deficit forecasts were not limited to Greece for example in the United States forecast for the 2009 budget deficit was raised from 407 billion projected in the 2009 fiscal year budget to 14 trillion while in the United Kingdom there was a final forecast more than 4 times higher than the original In Greece the low 68 forecast was reported until very late in the year September 2009 clearly not corresponding to the actual situation Fragmented financial regulation contributed to irresponsible lending in the years prior to the crisis In the eurozone each country had its own financial regulations which allowed financial institutions to exploit gaps in monitoring and regulatory responsibility to resort to loans that were highyield but very risky Harmonization or centralization in financial regulations could have alleviated the problem of risky loans Another factor that incentivized risky financial transaction was that national governments could not credibly commit not to bailout financial institutions who had undertaken risky loans thus causing a moral hazard problem The Eurozone can incentivize overborrowing through a tragedy of the commons Evolution of the crisis The European debt crisis erupted in the wake of the Great Recession around late 2009 and was characterized by an environment of overly high government structural deficits and accelerating debt levels When as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy As of January 2009 a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a bailout At the time the European Commission released a forecast of a 18 decline in EU economic output for 2009 making the outlook for the banks even worse The many public funded bank recapitalizations were one reason behind the sharply deteriorated debttoGDP ratios experienced by several European governments in the wake of the Great Recession The main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of weak actual and potential growth competitive weakness liquidation of banks and sovereigns large preexisting debttoGDP ratios and considerable liability stocks government private and nonprivate sector In the first few weeks of 2010 there was renewed anxiety about excessive national debt with lenders demanding everhigher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels deficits and current account deficits This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt particularly when economic growth rates were low and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors as in the case of Greece and Portugal The states that were adversely affected by the crisis faced a strong rise in interest rate spreads for government bonds as a result of investor concerns about their future debt sustainability Four eurozone states had to be rescued by sovereign bailout programs which were provided jointly by the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission with additional support at the technical level from the European Central Bank Together these three international organisations representing the bailout creditors became nicknamed the Troika To fight the crisis some governments have focused on raising taxes and lowering expenditures which contributed to social unrest and significant debate among economists many of whom advocate greater deficits when economies are struggling Especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on CDS between these countries and other EU member states most importantly Germany By the end of 2011 Germany was estimated to have made more than 9 billion out of the crisis as investors flocked to safer but near zero interest rate German federal government bonds bunds By July 2012 also the Netherlands Austria and Finland benefited from zero or negative interest rates Looking at shortterm government bonds with a maturity of less than one year the list of beneficiaries also includes Belgium and France While Switzerland and Denmark equally benefited from lower interest rates the crisis also harmed its export sector due to a substantial influx of foreign capital and the resulting rise of the Swiss franc In September 2011 the Swiss National Bank surprised currency traders by pledging that it will no longer tolerate a eurofranc exchange rate below the minimum rate of 120 francs effectively weakening the Swiss franc This is the biggest Swiss intervention since 1978 Despite sovereign debt having risen substantially in only a few eurozone countries with the three most affected countries Greece Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6 of the eurozones gross domestic product GDP it became a perceived problem for the area as a whole leading to concerns about further contagion of other European countries and a possible breakup of the eurozone In total the debt crisis forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of 2012 In mid2012 due to successful fiscal consolidation and implementation of structural reforms in the countries being most at risk and various policy measures taken by EU leaders and the ECB see below financial stability in the eurozone improved significantly and interest rates fell steadily This also greatly diminished contagion risk for other eurozone countries As of October 2012 only 3 out of 17 eurozone countries namely Greece Portugal and Cyprus still battled with longterm interest rates above 6 By early January 2013 successful sovereign debt auctions across the eurozone but most importantly in Ireland Spain and Portugal showed investors confidence in the ECB backstop As of May 2014 only two countries Greece and Cyprus still needed help from third parties Greece The Greek economy had fared well for much of the 20th century with high growth rates and low public debt By 2007 ie before the 20072008 financial crisis it was still one of the fastest growing in the eurozone with a public debttoGDP that did not exceed 104 but it was associated with a large structural deficit As the world economy was affected by the 20072008 financial crisis Greece was hit especially hard because its main industriesshipping and tourismwere especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the countrys debt increased accordingly The Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the Great Recession which led the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10 of GDP In the case of Greece the high budget deficit which after several corrections had been allowed to reach 102 and 151 of GDP in 2008 and 2009 respectively was coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio which until then was relatively stable for several years at just above 100 of GDP as calculated after all corrections Thus the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio which already reached 127 of GDP in 2009 In contrast Italy was able despite the crisis to keep its 2009 budget deficit at 51 of GDP which was crucial given that it had a public debt to GDP ratio comparable to Greeces In addition being a member of the Eurozone Greece had essentially no autonomous monetary policy flexibility Finally there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics due the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which led to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by about 10 a public debttoGDP ratio of about 100 until 2007 while there have been arguments about a possible effect of media reports Consequently Greece was punished by the markets which increased borrowing rates making it impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010 Despite the drastic upwards revision of the forecast for the 2009 budget deficit in October 2009 Greek borrowing rates initially rose rather slowly By April 2010 it was apparent that the country was becoming unable to borrow from the markets on 23 April 2010 the Greek government requested an initial loan of 45 billion from the EU and International Monetary Fund IMF to cover its financial needs for the remaining part of 2010 A few days later Standard Poors slashed Greeces sovereign debt rating to BB or junk status amid fears of default in which case investors were liable to lose 3050 of their money Stock markets worldwide and the euro currency declined in response to the downgrade On 1 May 2010 the Greek government announced a series of austerity measures the third austerity package within months to secure a threeyear 110 billion loan First Economic Adjustment Programme This was met with great anger by some Greeks leading to massive protests riots and social unrest throughout Greece The Troika a tripartite committee formed by the European Commission the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund EC ECB and IMF offered Greece a second bailout loan worth 130 billion in October 2011 Second Economic Adjustment Programme but with the activation being conditional on implementation of further austerity measures and a debt restructure agreement Surprisingly the Greek prime minister George Papandreou first answered that call by announcing a December 2011 referendum on the new bailout plan but had to back down amidst strong pressure from EU partners who threatened to withhold an overdue 6 billion loan payment that Greece needed by midDecember On 10 November 2011 Papandreou resigned following an agreement with the New Democracy party and the Popular Orthodox Rally to appoint nonMP technocrat Lucas Papademos as new prime minister of an interim national union government with responsibility for implementing the needed austerity measures to pave the way for the second bailout loan All the implemented austerity measures have helped Greece bring down its primary deficitie fiscal deficit before interest paymentsfrom 247bn 106 of GDP in 2009 to just 52bn 24 of GDP in 2011 but as a sideeffect they also contributed to a worsening of the Greek recession which began in October 2008 and only became worse in 2010 and 2011 The Greek GDP had its worst decline in 2011 with 69 a year where the seasonal adjusted industrial output ended 284 lower than in 2005 and with 111000 Greek companies going bankrupt 27 higher than in 2010 As a result Greeks have lost about 40 of their purchasing power since the start of the crisis they spend 40 less on goods and services and the seasonal adjusted unemployment rate grew from 75 in September 2008 to a record high of 279 in June 2013 while the youth unemployment rate rose from 220 to as high as 62 Youth unemployment ratio hit 161 per cent in 2012 Overall the share of the population living at risk of poverty or social exclusion did not increase notably during the first two years of the crisis The figure was measured to 276 in 2009 and 277 in 2010 only being slightly worse than the EU27average at 234 but for 2011 the figure was now estimated to have risen sharply above 33 In February 2012 an IMF official negotiating Greek austerity measures admitted that excessive spending cuts were harming Greece The IMF predicted the Greek economy to contract by 55 by 2014 Harsh austerity measures led to an actual contraction after six years of recession of 17 Some economic experts argue that the best option for Greece and the rest of the EU would be to engineer an orderly default allowing Athens to withdraw simultaneously from the eurozone and reintroduce its national currency the drachma at a debased rate If Greece were to leave the euro the economic and political consequences would be devastating According to Japanese financial company Nomura an exit would lead to a 60 devaluation of the new drachma Analysts at French bank BNP Paribas added that the fallout from a Greek exit would wipe 20 off Greeces GDP increase Greeces debttoGDP ratio to over 200 and send inflation soaring to 4050 Also UBS warned of hyperinflation a bank run and even military coups and possible civil war that could afflict a departing country Eurozone National Central Banks NCBs may lose up to 100bn in debt claims against the Greek national bank through the ECBs TARGET2 system The Deutsche Bundesbank alone may have to write off 27bn To prevent this from happening the Troika EC IMF and ECB eventually agreed in February 2012 to provide a second bailout package worth 130 billion conditional on the implementation of another harsh austerity package that would reduce Greek expenditure by 33bn in 2012 and another 10bn in 2013 and 2014 Then in March 2012 the Greek government did finally default on parts of its debt as there was a new law passed by the government so that private holders of Greek government bonds banks insurers and investment funds would voluntarily accept a bond swap with a 535 nominal writeoff partly in shortterm EFSF notes partly in new Greek bonds with lower interest rates and the maturity prolonged to 1130 years independently of the previous maturity This counted as a credit event and holders of credit default swaps were paid accordingly It was the worlds biggest debt restructuring deal ever done affecting some 206 billion of Greek government bonds The debt writeoff had a size of 107 billion and caused the Greek debt level to temporarily fall from roughly 350bn to 240bn in March 2012 it would subsequently rise again due to the resulting bank recapitalization needs with improved predictions about the debt burden In December 2012 the Greek government bought back 21 billion 27 billion of their bonds for 33 cents on the euro Critics such as the director of LSEs Hellenic Observatory argue that the billions of taxpayer euros are not saving Greece but financial institutions Of all 252bn in bailouts between 2010 and 2015 just 10 has found its way into financing continued public deficit spending on the Greek government accounts Much of the rest went straight into refinancing the old stock of Greek government debt originating mainly from the high general government deficits being run in previous years which was mainly held by private banks and hedge funds by the end of 2009 According to LSE more than 80 of the rescue package is going to refinance the expensive old maturing Greek government debt towards private creditors mainly private banks outside Greece replacing it with new debt to public creditors on more favourable terms that is to say paying out their private creditors with new debt issued by its new group of public creditors known as the Troika The shift in liabilities from European banks to European taxpayers has been staggering One study found that the public debt of Greece to foreign governments including debt to the EUIMF loan facility and debt through the Eurosystem increased from 478bn to 1805bn 1327bn between January 2010 and September 2011 while the combined exposure of foreign banks to public and private Greek entities was reduced from well over 200bn in 2009 to around 80bn 120bn by midFebruary 2012 As of 2015 78 of Greek debt is owed to public sector institutions primarily the EU According to a study by the European School of Management and Technology only 97bn or less than 5 of the first two bailout programs went to the Greek fiscal budget while most of the money went to French and German banks In June 2010 Frances and Germanys foreign claims visavis Greece were 57bn and 31bn respectively German banks owned 60bn of Greek Portuguese Irish and Spanish government debt and 151bn of banks debt of these countries According to a leaked document dated May 2010 the IMF was fully aware of the fact that the Greek bailout program was aimed at rescuing the private European banks mainly from France and Germany A number of IMF Executive Board members from India Brazil Argentina Russia and Switzerland criticized this in an internal memorandum pointing out that Greek debt would be unsustainable However their French German and Dutch colleagues refused to reduce the Greek debt or to make their private banks pay In mid May 2012 the crisis and impossibility to form a new government after elections and the possible victory by the antiausterity axis led to new speculations Greece would have to leave the eurozone shortly This phenomenon became known as Grexit and started to govern international market behaviour The centrerights narrow victory in 17 June election gave hope that Greece would honour its obligations and stay in the Eurozone Due to a delayed reform schedule and a worsened economic recession the new government immediately asked the Troika to be granted an extended deadline from 2015 to 2017 before being required to restore the budget into a selffinanced situation which in effect was equal to a request of a third bailout package for 201516 worth 326bn of extra loans On 11 November 2012 facing a default by the end of November the Greek parliament passed a new austerity package worth 188bn including a labour market reform and mid term fiscal plan 201316 In return the Eurogroup agreed on the following day to lower interest rates and prolong debt maturities and to provide Greece with additional funds of around 10bn for a debtbuyback programme The latter allowed Greece to retire about half of the 62 billion in debt that Athens owes private creditors thereby shaving roughly 20 billion off that debt This should bring Greeces debttoGDP ratio down to 124 by 2020 and well below 110 two years later Without agreement the debttoGDP ratio would have risen to 188 in 2013 The Financial Times special report on the future of the European Union argues that the liberalisation of labour markets has allowed Greece to narrow the costcompetitiveness gap with other southern eurozone countries by approximately 50 over the past two years This has been achieved primary through wage reductions though businesses have reacted positively The opening of product and service markets is proving tough because interest groups are slowing reforms The biggest challenge for Greece is to overhaul the tax administration with a significant part of annually assessed taxes not paid Poul Thomsen the IMF official who heads the bailout mission in Greece stated that in structural terms Greece is more than halfway there In June 2013 Equity index provider MSCI reclassified Greece as an emerging market citing failure to qualify on several criteria for market accessibility Both of the latest bailout programme audit reports released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014 revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012 there was a new forecast financing gap of 56bn in 2014 123bn in 2015 and 0bn in 2016 The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the governments additional lending from private capital markets or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy with return of a government structural surplus in 2012 return of real GDP growth in 2014 and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015 it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014 for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional private capital A total of 61bn was received from the sale of threeyear and fiveyear bonds in 2014 and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast financing gap for 2015 with additional sales of sevenyear and tenyear bonds in 2015 The latest recalculation of the seasonally adjusted quarterly GDP figures for the Greek economy revealed that it had been hit by three distinct recessions in the turmoil of the 20072008 financial crisis Q32007 until Q42007 duration 2 quarters Q22008 until Q12009 duration 4 quarters referred to as being part of the Great Recession Q32009 until Q42013 duration 18 quarters referred to as being part of the eurozone crisis Greece experienced positive economic growth in each of the three first quarters of 2014 The return of economic growth along with the now existing underlying structural budget surplus of the general government build the basis for the debttoGDP ratio to start a significant decline in the coming years ahead which will help ensure that Greece will be labelled debt sustainable and fully regain complete access to private lending markets in 2015 While the Greek governmentdebt crisis hereby is forecast officially to end in 2015 many of its negative repercussions eg a high unemployment rate are forecast still to be felt during many of the subsequent years During the second half of 2014 the Greek government again negotiated with the Troika The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the programme requirements to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014 and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 201516 When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government there was a disagreement with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed Midterm fiscal plan 201316 while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered financing gap at 25bn being required to be covered by additional austerity measures As the Greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 November to be voted for by the parliament on 7 December The Eurogroup was scheduled to meet and discuss the updated review of the Greek bailout programme on 8 December to be published on the same day and the potential adjustments to the remaining programme for 201516 There were rumours in the press that the Greek government has proposed immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 201516 replacing it with the transfer of 11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund HFSF along with establishment of a new precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line ECCL issued by the European Stability Mechanism The ECCL instrument is often used as a followup precautionary measure when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme with transfers only taking place if adverse financialeconomic circumstances materialize but with the positive effect that it help calm down financial markets as the presence of this extra backup guarantee mechanism makes the environment safer for investors The positive economic outlook for Greecebased on the return of seasonally adjusted real GDP growth across the first three quarters of 2014was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in Q42014 This new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to the premature snap parliamentary election called by the Greek parliament in December 2014 and the following formation of a Syrizaled government refusing to accept respecting the terms of its current bailout agreement The rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to Greece under its second programme until such time as the Greek government either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors This rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis both for the Greek government and Greek financial system resulting in plummeting stock prices at the Athens Stock Exchange while interest rates for the Greek government at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source Faced by the threat of a sovereign default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its second programme In the process the Eurogroup granted a sixmonth technical extension of its second bailout programme to Greece On 5 July 2015 the citizens of Greece voted decisively a 61 to 39 decision with 625 voter turnout to reject a referendum that would have given Greece more bailout help from other EU members in return for increased austerity measures As a result of this vote Greeces finance minister Yanis Varoufakis stepped down on 6 July Greece was the first developed country not to make a payment to the IMF on time in 2015 payment was made with a 20day delay Eventually Greece agreed on a third bailout package in August 2015 Between 2009 and 2017 the Greek government debt rose from 300 bn to 318 bn ie by only about 6 thanks in part to the 2012 debt restructuring however during the same period the critical debttoGDP ratio shot up from 127 to 179 basically due to the severe GDP drop during the handling of the crisis Greeces bailouts successfully ended as declared on 20 August 2018 Ireland The Irish sovereign debt crisis arose not from government overspending but from the state guaranteeing the six main Irishbased banks who had financed a property bubble On 29 September 2008 Finance Minister Brian Lenihan Jnr issued a twoyear guarantee to the banks depositors and bondholders The guarantees were subsequently renewed for new deposits and bonds in a slightly different manner In 2009 a National Asset Management Agency NAMA was created to acquire large propertyrelated loans from the six banks at a marketrelated longterm economic value Irish banks had lost an estimated 100 billion euros much of it related to defaulted loans to property developers and homeowners made in the midst of the property bubble which burst around 2007 The economy collapsed during 2008 Unemployment rose from 4 in 2006 to 14 by 2010 while the national budget went from a surplus in 2007 to a deficit of 32 GDP in 2010 the highest in the history of the eurozone despite austerity measures With Irelands credit rating falling rapidly in the face of mounting estimates of the banking losses guaranteed depositors and bondholders cashed in during 200910 and especially after August 2010 The necessary funds were borrowed from the central bank With yields on Irish Government debt rising rapidly it was clear that the Government would have to seek assistance from the EU and IMF resulting in a 675 billion bailout agreement of 29 November 2010 Together with additional 175 billion coming from Irelands own reserves and pensions the government received 85 billion of which up to 34 billion was to be used to support the countrys failing financial sector only about half of this was used in that way following stress tests conducted in 2011 In return the government agreed to reduce its budget deficit to below three per cent by 2015 In April 2011 despite all the measures taken Moodys downgraded the banks debt to junk status In July 2011 European leaders agreed to cut the interest rate that Ireland was paying on its EUIMF bailout loan from around 6 to between 35 and 4 and to double the loan time to 15 years The move was expected to save the country between 600 and 700 million euros per year On 14 September 2011 in a move to further ease Irelands difficult financial situation the European Commission announced it would cut the interest rate on its 225 billion loan coming from the European Financial Stability Mechanism down to 259 per centwhich is the interest rate the EU itself pays to borrow from financial markets The Euro Plus Monitor report from November 2011 attests to Irelands vast progress in dealing with its financial crisis expecting the country to stand on its own feet again and finance itself without any external support from the second half of 2012 onwards According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research Irelands exportled recovery will gradually pull its economy out of its trough As a result of the improved economic outlook the cost of 10year government bonds has fallen from its record high at 12 in mid July 2011 to below 4 in 2013 see the graph Longterm Interest Rates On 26 July 2012 for the first time since September 2010 Ireland was able to return to the financial markets selling over 5 billion in longterm government debt with an interest rate of 59 for the 5year bonds and 61 for the 8year bonds at sale In December 2013 after three years on financial life support Ireland finally left the EUIMF bailout programme although it retained a debt of 225 billion to the IMF in August 2014 early repayment of 15 billion was being considered which would save the country 375 million in surcharges Despite the end of the bailout the countrys unemployment rate remains high and public sector wages are still around 20 lower than at the beginning of the crisis Government debt reached 1237 of GDP in 2013 On 13 March 2013 Ireland managed to regain complete lending access on financial markets when it successfully issued 5bn of 10year maturity bonds at a yield of 43 Ireland ended its bailout programme as scheduled in December 2013 without any need for additional financial support Portugal Unlike other European countries that were also severely hit by the Great Recession in the late 2000s and eventually received bailouts in the early 2010s such as Greece and Ireland Portugal had the characteristic that the 2000s were not marked by economic growth but were already a period of economic crisis marked by stagnation two recessions in 200203 and 200809 and governmentsponsored fiscal austerity in order to reduce the budget deficit to the limits allowed by the European Unions Stability and Growth Pact According to a report by the Dirio de Notcias Portugal had allowed considerable slippage in statemanaged public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010 Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants Risky credit public debt creation and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy together with the US subprime mortgage crisis and the eurozone crisis Portugal was one of the first economies to succumb and was affected very deeply In the summer of 2010 Moodys Investors Service cut Portugals sovereign bond rating which led to an increased pressure on Portuguese government bonds In the first half of 2011 Portugal requested a 78 billion IMFEU bailout package in a bid to stabilise its public finances Portugals debt was in September 2012 forecast by the Troika to peak at around 124 of GDP in 2014 followed by a firm downward trajectory after 2014 Previously the Troika had predicted it would peak at 1185 of GDP in 2013 so the developments proved to be a bit worse than first anticipated but the situation was described as fully sustainable and progressing well As a result from the slightly worse economic circumstances the country has been given one more year to reduce the budget deficit to a level below 3 of GDP moving the target year from 2013 to 2014 The budget deficit for 2012 has been forecast to end at 5 The recession in the economy is now also projected to last until 2013 with GDP declining 3 in 2012 and 1 in 2013 followed by a return to positive real growth in 2014 Unemployment rate increased to over 17 by end of 2012 but it has since decreased gradually to 105 as of November 2016 As part of the bailout programme Portugal was required to regain complete access to financial markets by September 2013 The first step towards this target was successfully taken on 3 October 2012 when the country managed to regain partial market access by selling a bond series with 3year maturity Once Portugal regains complete market access measured as the moment it successfully manages to sell a bond series with a full 10year maturity it is expected to benefit from interventions by the ECB which announced readiness to implement extended support in the form of some yieldlowering bond purchases OMTs aiming to bring governmental interest rates down to sustainable levels A peak for the Portuguese 10year governmental interest rates happened on 30 January 2012 where it reached 173 after the rating agencies had cut the governments credit rating to noninvestment grade also referred to as junk As of December 2012 it has been more than halved to only 7 A successful return to the longterm lending market was made by the issuing of a 5year maturity bond series in January 2013 and the state regained complete lending access when it successfully issued a 10year maturity bond series on 7 May 2013 According to the Financial Times special report on the future of the European Union the Portuguese government has made progress in reforming labour legislation cutting previously generous redundancy payments by more than half and freeing smaller employers from collective bargaining obligations all components of Portugals 78 billion bailout program Additionally unit labour costs have fallen since 2009 working practices are liberalizing and industrial licensing is being streamlined On 18 May 2014 Portugal left the EU bailout mechanism without additional need for support as it had already regained a complete access to lending markets back in May 2013 and with its latest issuing of a 10year government bond being successfully completed with a rate as low as 359 Portugal still has many tough years ahead During the crisis Portugals government debt increased from 93 to 139 percent of GDP On 3 August 2014 Banco de Portugal announced the countrys second biggest bank Banco Esprito Santo would be split in two after losing the equivalent of 48 billion in the first 6 months of 2014 sending its shares down by 89 percent Spain Spain had a comparatively low debt level among advanced economies prior to the crisis Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60 more than 20 points less than Germany France or the US and more than 60 points less than Italy or Greece Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation When the bubble burst Spain spent large amounts of money on bank bailouts In May 2012 Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout on top of the previous 45 billion euros to prop up Bankia Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses During September 2012 regulators indicated that Spanish banks required 59 billion US77 billion in additional capital to offset losses from real estate investments The bank bailouts and the economic downturn increased the countrys deficit and debt levels and led to a substantial downgrading of its credit rating To build up trust in the financial markets the government began to introduce austerity measures and in 2011 it passed a law in congress to approve an amendment to the Spanish Constitution to require a balanced budget at both the national and regional level by 2020 The amendment states that public debt can not exceed 60 of GDP though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe economic recession or other emergencies As one of the largest eurozone economies larger than Greece Portugal and Ireland combined the condition of Spains economy is of particular concern to international observers Under pressure from the United States the IMF other European countries and the European Commission the Spanish governments eventually succeeded in trimming the deficit from 112 of GDP in 2009 to 71 in 2013 Nevertheless in June 2012 Spain became a prime concern for the Eurozone when interest on Spains 10year bonds reached the 7 level and it faced difficulty in accessing bond markets This led the Eurogroup on 9 June 2012 to grant Spain a financial support package of up to 100 billion The funds will not go directly to Spanish banks but be transferred to a governmentowned Spanish fund responsible to conduct the needed bank recapitalisations FROB and thus it will be counted for as additional sovereign debt in Spains national account An economic forecast in June 2012 highlighted the need for the arranged bank recapitalisation support package as the outlook promised a negative growth rate of 17 unemployment rising to 25 and a continued declining trend for housing prices In September 2012 the ECB removed some of the pressure from Spain on financial markets when it announced its unlimited bondbuying plan to be initiated if Spain would sign a new sovereign bailout package with EFSFESM Strictly speaking Spain was not hit by a sovereign debtcrisis in 2012 as the financial support package that they received from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund and did not include financial support for the government itself According to the latest debt sustainability analysis published by the European Commission in October 2012 the fiscal outlook for Spain if assuming the country will stick to the fiscal consolidation path and targets outlined by the countrys current EDP programme will result in a debttoGDP ratio reaching its maximum at 110 in 2018followed by a declining trend in subsequent years In regards of the structural deficit the same outlook has promised that it will gradually decline to comply with the maximum 05 level required by the Fiscal Compact in 20222027 Though Spain was suffering with 27 unemployment and the economy was shrinking 14 in 2013 Mariano Rajoys conservative government has pledged to speed up reforms according to the Financial Times special report on the future of the European Union Madrid is reviewing its labour market and pension reforms and has promised by the end of this year to liberalize its heavily regulated professions But Spain is benefiting from improved labour cost competitiveness They have not lost export market share says Eric Chaney chief economist at Axa If credit starts flowing again Spain could surprise us On 23 January 2014 as foreign investor confidence in the country has been restored Spain formally exited the EUIMF bailout mechanism By the end of March 2018 unemployment rate of Spain has fallen to 161 and the debt is 9830 of the GDP Cyprus The economy of the small island of Cyprus with 840000 people was hit by several huge blows in and around 2012 including amongst other things the 22 billion exposure of Cypriot banks to the Greek debt haircut the downgrading of the Cypriot economy into junk status by international rating agencies and the inability of the government to refund its state expenses On 25 June 2012 the Cypriot Government requested a bailout from the European Financial Stability Facility or the European Stability Mechanism citing difficulties in supporting its banking sector from the exposure to the Greek debt haircut On 30 November the Troika the European Commission the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank and the Cypriot Government had agreed on the bailout terms with only the amount of money required for the bailout remaining to be agreed upon Bailout terms include strong austerity measures including cuts in civil service salaries social benefits allowances and pensions and increases in VAT tobacco alcohol and fuel taxes taxes on lottery winnings property and higher public health care charges At the insistence of the Commission negotiators at first the proposal also included an unprecedented oneoff levy of 67 for deposits up to 100000 and 99 for higher deposits on all domestic bank accounts Following public outcry the eurozone finance ministers were forced to change the levy excluding deposits of less than 100000 and introducing a higher 156 levy on deposits of above 100000 129600in line with the EU minimum deposit guarantee This revised deal was also rejected by the Cypriot parliament on 19 March 2013 with 36 votes against 19 abstentions and one not present for the vote The final agreement was settled on 25 March 2013 with the proposal to close the most troubled Laiki Bank which helped significantly to reduce the needed loan amount for the overall bailout package so that 10bn was sufficient without need for imposing a general levy on bank deposits The final conditions for activation of the bailout package was outlined by the Troikas MoU agreement which was endorsed in full by the Cypriot House of Representatives on 30 April 2013 It includes Recapitalisation of the entire financial sector while accepting a closure of the Laiki bank Implementation of the antimoney laundering framework in Cypriot financial institutions Fiscal consolidation to help bring down the Cypriot governmental budget deficit Structural reforms to restore competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances Privatization programme The Cypriot debttoGDP ratio is on this background now forecasted only to peak at 126 in 2015 and subsequently decline to 105 in 2020 and thus considered to remain within sustainable territory Although the bailout support programme feature sufficient financial transfers until March 2016 Cyprus began slowly to regain its access to the private lending markets already in June 2014 At this point of time the government sold 075bn of bonds with a fiveyear maturity to the tune of a 485 yield A continued selling of bonds with a tenyear maturity which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market and mark the end of the era with need for bailout support is expected to happen sometime in 2015 The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note EMTN bonds in 2015 likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another 11bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a 09bn bond on 1 November As announced in advance the Cypriot government issued 1bn of sevenyear bonds with a 40 yield by the end of April 2015 Policy reactions EU emergency measures The table below provides an overview of the financial composition of all bailout programs being initiated for EU member states since the global financial crisis erupted in September 2008 EU member states outside the eurozone marked with yellow in the table have no access to the funds provided by EFSFESM but can be covered with rescue loans from EUs Balance of Payments programme BoP IMF and bilateral loans with an extra possible assistance from the WorldbankEIBEBRD if classified as a development country Since October 2012 the ESM as a permanent new financial stability fund to cover any future potential bailout packages within the eurozone has effectively replaced the now defunct GLF EFSM EFSF funds Whenever pledged funds in a scheduled bailout program were not transferred in full the table has noted this by writing Y out of X European Financial Stability Facility EFSF On 9 May 2010 the 27 EU member states agreed to create the European Financial Stability Facility a legal instrument aiming at preserving financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to eurozone states in difficulty The EFSF can issue bonds or other debt instruments on the market with the support of the German Debt Management Office to raise the funds needed to provide loans to eurozone countries in financial troubles recapitalise banks or buy sovereign debt Emissions of bonds are backed by guarantees given by the euro area member states in proportion to their share in the paidup capital of the European Central Bank The 440 billion lending capacity of the facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the eurozone countries governments and may be combined with loans up to 60 billion from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism reliant on funds raised by the European Commission using the EU budget as collateral and up to 250 billion from the International Monetary Fund IMF to obtain a financial safety net up to 750 billion The EFSF issued 5 billion of fiveyear bonds in its inaugural benchmark issue 25 January 2011 attracting an order book of 445 billion This amount is a record for any sovereign bond in Europe and 245 billion more than the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism EFSM a separate European Union funding vehicle with a 5 billion issue in the first week of January 2011 On 29 November 2011 the member state finance ministers agreed to expand the EFSF by creating certificates that could guarantee up to 30 of new issues from troubled euroarea governments and to create investment vehicles that would boost the EFSFs firepower to intervene in primary and secondary bond markets The transfers of bailout funds were performed in tranches over several years and were conditional on the governments simultaneously implementing a package of fiscal consolidation structural reforms privatization of public assets and setting up funds for further bank recapitalization and resolution Reception by financial markets Stocks surged worldwide after the EU announced the EFSFs creation The facility eased fears that the Greek debt crisis would spread and this led to some stocks rising to the highest level in a year or more The euro made its biggest gain in 18 months before falling to a new fouryear low a week later Shortly after the euro rose again as hedge funds and other shortterm traders unwound short positions and carry trades in the currency Commodity prices also rose following the announcement The dollar Libor held at a ninemonth high Default swaps also fell The VIX closed down a record almost 30 after a record weekly rise the preceding week that prompted the bailout The agreement is interpreted as allowing the ECB to start buying government debt from the secondary market which is expected to reduce bond yields As a result Greek bond yields fell sharply from over 10 to just over 5 Asian bonds yields also fell with the EU bailout Usage of EFSF funds The EFSF only raises funds after an aid request is made by a country As of the end of July 2012 it has been activated various times In November 2010 it financed 177 billion of the total 675 billion rescue package for Ireland the rest was loaned from individual European countries the European Commission and the IMF In May 2011 it contributed onethird of the 78 billion package for Portugal As part of the second bailout for Greece the loan was shifted to the EFSF amounting to 164 billion 130bn new package plus 344bn remaining from Greek Loan Facility throughout 2014 On 20 July 2012 European finance ministers sanctioned the first tranche of a partial bailout worth up to 100 billion for Spanish banks This leaves the EFSF with 148 billion or an equivalent of 444 billion in leveraged firepower The EFSF is set to expire in 2013 running some months parallel to the permanent 500 billion rescue funding program called the European Stability Mechanism ESM which will start operating as soon as member states representing 90 of the capital commitments have ratified it see section ESM On 13 January 2012 Standard Poors downgraded France and Austria from AAA rating lowered Spain Italy and five other euro members further Shortly after SP also downgraded the EFSF from AAA to AA European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism EFSM On 5 January 2011 the European Union created the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism EFSM an emergency funding programme reliant upon funds raised on the financial markets and guaranteed by the European Commission using the budget of the European Union as collateral It runs under the supervision of the Commission and aims at preserving financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to EU member states in economic difficulty The Commission fund backed by all 27 European Union members has the authority to raise up to 60 billion and is rated AAA by Fitch Moodys and Standard Poors Under the EFSM the EU successfully placed in the capital markets an 5 billion issue of bonds as part of the financial support package agreed for Ireland at a borrowing cost for the EFSM of 259 Like the EFSF the EFSM was replaced by the permanent rescue funding programme ESM which was launched in September 2012 Brussels agreement and aftermath On 26 October 2011 leaders of the 17 eurozone countries met in Brussels and agreed on a 50 writeoff of Greek sovereign debt held by banks a fourfold increase to about 1 trillion in bailout funds held under the European Financial Stability Facility an increased mandatory level of 9 for bank capitalisation within the EU and a set of commitments from Italy to take measures to reduce its national debt Also pledged was 35 billion in credit enhancement to mitigate losses likely to be suffered by European banks European Commission president Jos Manuel Barroso characterised the package as a set of exceptional measures for exceptional times The packages acceptance was put into doubt on 31 October when Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced that a referendum would be held so that the Greek people would have the final say on the bailout upsetting financial markets On 3 November 2011 the promised Greek referendum on the bailout package was withdrawn by Prime Minister Papandreou In late 2011 Landon Thomas in the New York Times noted that some at least European banks were maintaining high dividend payout rates and none were getting capital injections from their governments even while being required to improve capital ratios Thomas quoted Richard Koo an economist based in Japan an expert on that countrys banking crisis and specialist in balance sheet recessions as saying I do not think Europeans understand the implications of a systemic banking crisis When all banks are forced to raise capital at the same time the result is going to be even weaker banks and an even longer recessionif not depression Government intervention should be the first resort not the last resort Beyond equity issuance and debttoequity conversion then one analyst said that as banks find it more difficult to raise funds they will move faster to cut down on loans and unload lagging assets as they work to improve capital ratios This latter contraction of balance sheets could lead to a depression the analyst said Reduced lending was a circumstance already at the time being seen in a deepening crisis in commodities trade finance in western Europe Final agreement on the second bailout package In a marathon meeting on 2021 February 2012 the Eurogroup agreed with the IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth 130 billion The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50 to 535 EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility to a level of just 150 basis points above Euribor Furthermore governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020 Altogether this should bring down Greeces debt to between 117 and 1205 of GDP by 2020 European Central Bank The European Central Bank ECB has taken a series of measures aimed at reducing volatility in the financial markets and at improving liquidity In May 2010 it took the following actions It began open market operations buying government and private debt securities reaching 2195 billion in February 2012 though it simultaneously absorbed the same amount of liquidity to prevent a rise in inflation According to Rabobank economist Elwin de Groot there is a natural limit of 300 billion the ECB can sterilise It reactivated the dollar swap lines with Federal Reserve support It changed its policy regarding the necessary credit rating for loan deposits accepting as collateral all outstanding and new debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Greek government regardless of the nations credit rating The move took some pressure off Greek government bonds which had just been downgraded to junk status making it difficult for the government to raise money on capital markets On 30 November 2011 the ECB the US Federal Reserve the central banks of Canada Japan Britain and the Swiss National Bank provided global financial markets with additional liquidity to ward off the debt crisis and to support the real economy The central banks agreed to lower the cost of dollar currency swaps by 50 basis points to come into effect on 5 December 2011 They also agreed to provide each other with abundant liquidity to make sure that commercial banks stay liquid in other currencies With the aim of boosting the recovery in the eurozone economy by lowering interest rates for businesses the ECB cut its bank rates in multiple steps in 20122013 reaching an historic low of 025 in November 2013 The lowered borrowing rates have also caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies which is hoped will boost exports from the eurozone and further aid the recovery With inflation falling to 05 in May 2014 the ECB again took measures to stimulate the eurozone economy which grew at just 02 during the first quarter of 2014 Deflation or very low inflation encourages holding cash causing a decrease in purchases On 5 June the central bank cut the prime interest rate to 015 and set the deposit rate at 010 The latter move in particular was seen as a bold and unusual move as a negative interest rate had never been tried on a widescale before Additionally the ECB announced it would offer longterm fouryear loans at the cheap rate normally the rate is primarily for overnight lending but only if the borrowing banks met strict conditions designed to ensure the funds ended up in the hands of businesses instead of for example being used to buy low risk government bonds Collectively the moves are aimed at avoiding deflation devaluing the euro to make exportation more viable and at increasing real world lending Stock markets reacted strongly to the ECB rate cuts The German DAX index for example set a record high the day the new rates were announced Meanwhile the euro briefly fell to a fourmonth low against the dollar However due to the unprecedented nature of the negative interest rate the longterm effects of the stimulus measures are hard to predict Bank president Mario Draghi signalled the central bank was willing to do whatever it takes to turn around the eurozone economies remarking Are we finished The answer is no He laid the groundwork for largescale bond repurchasing a controversial idea known as quantitative easing Resignations In September 2011 Jrgen Stark became the second German after Axel A Weber to resign from the ECB Governing Council in 2011 Weber the former Deutsche Bundesbank president was once thought to be a likely successor to JeanClaude Trichet as bank president He and Stark were both thought to have resigned due to unhappiness with the ECBs bond purchases which critics say erode the banks independence Stark was probably the most hawkish member of the council when he resigned Weber was replaced by his Bundesbank successor Jens Weidmann while Belgiums Peter Praet took Starks original position heading the ECBs economics department Long Term Refinancing Operation LTRO On 22 December 2011 the ECB started the biggest infusion of credit into the European banking system in the euros 13year history Under its Long Term Refinancing Operations LTROs it loaned 489 billion to 523 banks for an exceptionally long period of three years at a rate of just one per cent Previous refinancing operations matured after three six and twelve months The by far biggest amount of 325 billion was tapped by banks in Greece Ireland Italy and Spain This way the ECB tried to make sure that banks have enough cash to pay off 200 billion of their own maturing debts in the first three months of 2012 and at the same time keep operating and loaning to businesses so that a credit crunch does not choke off economic growth It also hoped that banks would use some of the money to buy government bonds effectively easing the debt crisis On 29 February 2012 the ECB held a second auction LTRO2 providing 800 eurozone banks with further 5295 billion in cheap loans Net new borrowing under the 5295 billion February auction was around 313 billion out of a total of 256 billion existing ECB lending MRO 3m6m LTROs 215 billion was rolled into LTRO2 ECB lending has largely replaced interbank lending Spain has 365 billion and Italy has 281 billion of borrowings from the ECB June 2012 data Germany has 275 billion on deposit Reorganization of the European banking system On 16 June 2012 the European Central Bank together with other European leaders hammered out plans for the ECB to become a bank regulator and to form a deposit insurance program to augment national programs Other economic reforms promoting European growth and employment were also proposed Outright Monetary Transactions OMTs On 6 September 2012 the ECB announced to offer additional financial support in the form of some yieldlowering bond purchases OMT for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSFESM A eurozone country can benefit from the program if and for as long as it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels but only at the point of time where the country possessesregains a complete market access and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding MoU agreement Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will by definition have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout Ireland Portugal and Greece they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in SeptemberOctober the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB and started slowly to pricein a decline of both shortterm and longterm interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential backstop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates and just the knowledge about their potential existence in the very near future helped to calm the markets European Stability Mechanism ESM The European Stability Mechanism ESM is a permanent rescue funding programme to succeed the temporary European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism in July 2012 but it had to be postponed until after the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany had confirmed the legality of the measures on 12 September 2012 The permanent bailout fund entered into force for 16 signatories on 27 September 2012 It became effective in Estonia on 4 October 2012 after the completion of their ratification process On 16 December 2010 the European Council agreed a two line amendment to the EU Lisbon Treaty to allow for a permanent bailout mechanism to be established including stronger sanctions In March 2011 the European Parliament approved the treaty amendment after receiving assurances that the European Commission rather than EU states would play a central role in running the ESM The ESM is an intergovernmental organisation under public international law It is located in Luxembourg Such a mechanism serves as a financial firewall Instead of a default by one country rippling through the entire interconnected financial system the firewall mechanism can ensure that downstream nations and banking systems are protected by guaranteeing some or all of their obligations Then the single default can be managed while limiting financial contagion European Fiscal Compact In March 2011 a new reform of the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated aiming at straightening the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3 deficit or the 60 debt rules By the end of the year Germany France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing with penalties for those countries who violate the limits All other noneurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in subject to parliamentary vote The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013 if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it Originally EU leaders planned to change existing EU treaties but this was blocked by British prime minister David Cameron who demanded that the City of London be excluded from future financial regulations including the proposed EU financial transaction tax By the end of the day 26 countries had agreed to the plan leaving the United Kingdom as the only country not willing to join Cameron subsequently conceded that his action had failed to secure any safeguards for the UK Britains refusal to be part of the fiscal compact to safeguard the eurozone constituted a de facto refusal PM David Cameron vetoed the project to engage in any radical revision of the Lisbon Treaty John Rentoul of The Independent concluded that Any Prime Minister would have done as Cameron did Economic reforms and recovery proposals Direct loans to banks and banking regulation On 28 June 2012 eurozone leaders agreed to permit loans by the European Stability Mechanism to be made directly to stressed banks rather than through eurozone states to avoid adding to sovereign debt The reform was linked to plans for banking regulation by the European Central Bank The reform was immediately reflected by a reduction in yield of longterm bonds issued by member states such as Italy and Spain and a rise in value of the Euro Less austerity more investment There has been substantial criticism over the austerity measures implemented by most European nations to counter this debt crisis US economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that an abrupt return to nonKeynesian financial policies is not a viable solution Pointing at historical evidence he predicts that deflationary policies now being imposed on countries such as Greece and Spain will prolong and deepen their recessions Together with over 9000 signatories of A Manifesto for Economic Sense Krugman also dismissed the belief of austerity focusing policy makers such as EU economic commissioner Olli Rehn and most European finance ministers that budget consolidation revives confidence in financial markets over the longer haul In a 2003 study that analysed 133 IMF austerity programmes the IMFs independent evaluation office found that policy makers consistently underestimated the disastrous effects of rigid spending cuts on economic growth In early 2012 an IMF official who negotiated Greek austerity measures admitted that spending cuts were harming Greece In October 2012 the IMF said that its forecasts for countries which implemented austerity programmes have been consistently overoptimistic suggesting that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected and countries which implemented fiscal stimulus such as Germany and Austria did better than expected Also Portugal did comparably better than Spain The latter introduced drastic austerity measures but was unable not meet its EU budget deficit targets On the other hand Portugals leftist coalition fought austerity it increased the minimum wage by 25 percent and took back cuts in the pension system and the public sector and at the same time reduced its budget deficit to below three percent in 2016 According to historian Florian Schui from University of St Gallen no austerity program has ever worked Schui particularly notes Winston Churchills attempt in 1925 and Heinrich Brnings attempt in 1930 during the Weimar Republic Both led to disastrous consequences According to Keynesian economists growthfriendly austerity relies on the false argument that public cuts would be compensated for by more spending from consumers and businesses a theoretical claim that has not materialised The case of Greece shows that excessive levels of private indebtedness and a collapse of public confidence over 90 of Greeks fear unemployment poverty and the closure of businesses led the private sector to decrease spending in an attempt to save up for rainy days ahead This led to even lower demand for both products and labour which further deepened the recession and made it ever more difficult to generate tax revenues and fight public indebtedness According to Financial Times chief economics commentator Martin Wolf structural tightening does deliver actual tightening But its impact is much less than one to one A one percentage point reduction in the structural deficit delivers a 067 percentage point improvement in the actual fiscal deficit This means that Ireland eg would require structural fiscal tightening of more than 12 to eliminate its 2012 actual fiscal deficit A task that is difficult to achieve without an exogenous eurozonewide economic boom According to the Europlus Monitor Report 2012 no country should tighten its fiscal reins by more than 2 of GDP in one year to avoid recession Instead of public austerity a growth compact centring on tax increases and deficit spending is proposed Since struggling European countries lack the funds to engage in deficit spending German economist and member of the German Council of Economic Experts Peter Bofinger and Sony Kapoor of the global think tank ReDefine suggest providing 40 billion in additional funds to the European Investment Bank EIB which could then lend ten times that amount to the employmentintensive smaller business sector The EU is currently planning a possible 10 billion increase in the EIBs capital base Furthermore the two suggest financing additional public investments by growthfriendly taxes on property land wealth carbon emissions and the undertaxed financial sector They also called on EU countries to renegotiate the EU savings tax directive and to sign an agreement to help each other crack down on tax evasion and avoidance Currently authorities capture less than 1 in annual tax revenue on untaxed wealth transferred between EU members According to the Tax Justice Network worldwide a global superrich elite had between 21 and 32 trillion up to 26000bn Euros hidden in secret tax havens by the end of 2010 resulting in a tax deficit of up to 280bn Apart from arguments over whether or not austerity rather than increased or frozen spending is a macroeconomic solution union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists investors and bankers Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed as a consequence of the global economic crisis of 20072010 and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe but the entire world After the 20072008 financial crisis and the Great Recession the focus across all EU member states was to gradually to implement austerity measures with the purpose of lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3 of GDP so that the debt level would either stay below or start decline towards the 60 limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact To further restore the confidence in Europe 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national lawconstitution The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact but it is more strict not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national lawconstitution but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 05 or 1 depending on the debt level Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme Greece Portugal and Ireland was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidationausterity and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation ie lowering their relative production costs The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed not only to build the foundation for GDP growth but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states Germany has come under pressure due to not having a government budget deficit and funding it by borrowing more As of late 2014 the government federal and state has spent less than it receives in revenue for the third year in a row despite low economic growth The 2015 budget includes a surplus for the first time since 1969 Current projections are that by 2019 the debt will be less than required by the Stability and Growth Pact It has been a long known belief that austerity measures will always reduce the GDP growth in the short term Some economists believing in Keynesian policies criticised the timing and amount of austerity measures being called for in the bailout programmes as they argued such extensive measures should not be implemented during the crisis years with an ongoing recession but if possible delayed until the years after some positive real GDP growth had returned In October 2012 a report published by International Monetary Fund IMF also found that tax hikes and spending cuts during the most recent decade had indeed damaged the GDP growth more severely compared to what had been expected and forecasted in advance based on the GDP damage ratios previously recorded in earlier decades and under different economic scenarios Already a halfyear earlier several European countries as a response to the problem with subdued GDP growth in the eurozone likewise had called for the implementation of a new reinforced growth strategy based on additional public investments to be financed by growthfriendly taxes on property land wealth and financial institutions In June 2012 EU leaders agreed as a first step to moderately increase the funds of the European Investment Bank in order to kickstart infrastructure projects and increase loans to the private sector A few months later 11 out of 17 eurozone countries also agreed to introduce a new EU financial transaction tax to be collected from 1 January 2014 Progress In April 2012 Olli Rehn the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs in Brussels enthusiastically announced to EU parliamentarians in midApril that there was a breakthrough before Easter He said the European heads of state had given the green light to pilot projects worth billions such as building highways in Greece Other growth initiatives include project bonds wherein the EIB would provide guarantees that safeguard private investors In the pilot phase until 2013 EU funds amounting to 230 million are expected to mobilise investments of up to 46 billion Der Spiegel also said According to sources inside the German government instead of funding new highways Berlin is interested in supporting innovation and programs to promote small and mediumsized businesses To ensure that this is done as professionally as possible the Germans would like to see the southern European countries receive their own stateowned development banks modeled after Germanys Marshall Planeraorigin KfW Kreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau banking group Its hoped that this will get the economy moving in Greece and Portugal In multiple steps during 20122013 the ECB lowered its bank rate to historical lows reaching 025 in November 2013 Soon after the rates were shaved to 015 then on 4 September 2014 the central bank shocked financial markets by cutting the razorthin rates by a further two thirds from 015 to 005 the lowest on record The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB with the aim that lower cost of money would be passed on to businesses taking out loans boosting investment in the economy The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies which it was hoped would boost exports from the eurozone Increase competitiveness Crisis countries must significantly increase their international competitiveness to generate economic growth and improve their terms of trade IndianAmerican journalist Fareed Zakaria notes in November 2011 that no debt restructuring will work without growth even more so as European countries face pressures from three fronts demography an aging population technology which has allowed companies to do much more with fewer people and globalisation which has allowed manufacturing and services to locate across the world In case of economic shocks policy makers typically try to improve competitiveness by depreciating the currency as in the case of Iceland which suffered the largest financial crisis in 20082011 in economic history but has since vastly improved its position Eurozone countries cannot devalue their currency Internal devaluation As a workaround many policy makers try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation a painful economic adjustment process where a country aims to reduce its unit labour costs German economist HansWerner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation in the last five years which helped decrease its relative pricewage levels by 16 Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31 effectively reaching the level of Turkey By 2012 wages in Greece had been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986 Similarly salaries in Italy fell to 1986 levels and consumption fell to the level of 1950 Other economists argue that no matter how much Greece and Portugal drive down their wages they could never compete with lowcost developing countries such as China or India Instead weak European countries must shift their economies to higher quality products and services though this is a longterm process and may not bring immediate relief Fiscal devaluation Another option would be to implement fiscal devaluation based on an idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931 According to this neoKeynesian logic policy makers can increase the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employers social security contributions while offsetting the loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption VAT and pollution ie by pursuing an ecological tax reform Germany has successfully pushed its economic competitiveness by increasing the value added tax VAT by three percentage points in 2007 and using part of the additional revenues to lower employers unemployment insurance contribution Portugal has taken a similar stance and also France appears to follow this suit In November 2012 French president Franois Hollande announced plans to reduce tax burden of the corporate sector by 20 billion within three years while increasing the standard VAT from 196 to 20 and introducing additional ecotaxes in 2016 To minimise negative effects of such policies on purchasing power and economic activity the French government will partly offset the tax hikes by decreasing employees social security contributions by 10 billion and by reducing the lower VAT for convenience goods necessities from 55 to 5 Progress On 15 November 2011 the Lisbon Council published the Euro Plus Monitor 2011 According to the report most critical eurozone member countries are in the process of rapid reforms The authors note that Many of those countries most in need to adjust are now making the greatest progress towards restoring their fiscal balance and external competitiveness Greece Ireland and Spain are among the top five reformers and Portugal is ranked seventh among 17 countries included in the report see graph In its Euro Plus Monitor Report 2012 published in November 2012 the Lisbon Council finds that the eurozone has slightly improved its overall health With the exception of Greece all eurozone crisis countries are either close to the point where they have achieved the major adjustment or are likely to get there over the course of 2013 Portugal and Italy are expected to progress to the turnaround stage in spring 2013 possibly followed by Spain in autumn while the fate of Greece continues to hang in the balance Overall the authors suggest that if the eurozone gets through the current acute crisis and stays on the reform path it could eventually emerge from the crisis as the most dynamic of the major Western economies The Euro Plus Monitor update from spring 2013 notes that the eurozone remains on the right track According to the authors almost all vulnerable countries in need of adjustment are slashing their underlying fiscal deficits and improving their external competitiveness at an impressive speed for which they expected the eurozone crisis to be over by the end of 2013 Address current account imbalances Regardless of the corrective measures chosen to solve the current predicament as long as cross border capital flows remain unregulated in the euro area current account imbalances are likely to continue A country that runs a large current account or trade deficit ie importing more than it exports must ultimately be a net importer of capital this is a mathematical identity called the balance of payments In other words a country that imports more than it exports must either decrease its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports Conversely Germanys large trade surplus net export position means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital lending money to other countries to allow them to buy German goods The 2009 trade deficits for Italy Spain Greece and Portugal were estimated to be 4296bn 7531bn and 3597bn and 256bn respectively while Germanys trade surplus was 1886bn A similar imbalance exists in the US which runs a large trade deficit net import position and therefore is a net borrower of capital from abroad Ben Bernanke warned of the risks of such imbalances in 2005 arguing that a savings glut in one country with a trade surplus can drive capital into other countries with trade deficits artificially lowering interest rates and creating asset bubbles A country with a large trade surplus would generally see the value of its currency appreciate relative to other currencies which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting countrys currency used to purchase the goods Alternatively trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders or by raising interest rates although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments Either way many of the countries involved in the crisis are on the euro so devaluation individual interest rates and capital controls are not available The only solution left to raise a countrys level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits For example if a countrys citizens saved more instead of consuming imports this would reduce its trade deficit It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits eg Greece consume less and improve their exporting industries On the other hand export driven countries with a large trade surplus such as Germany Austria and the Netherlands would need to shift their economies more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption Economic evidence indicates the crisis may have more to do with trade deficits which require private borrowing to fund than public debt levels Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March 2013 the really strong relationship within the eurozone countries is between interest spreads and current account deficits which is in line with the conclusion many of us have reached that the euro area crisis is really a balance of payments crisis not a debt crisis A February 2013 paper from four economists concluded that Countries with debt above 80 of GDP and persistent currentaccount trade deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal deterioration Progress In its spring 2012 economic forecast the European Commission finds some evidence that the currentaccount rebalancing is underpinned by changes in relative prices and competitiveness positions as well as gains in export market shares and expenditure switching in deficit countries In May 2012 German finance minister Wolfgang Schuble has signalled support for a significant increase in German wages to help decrease current account imbalances within the eurozone According to the Euro Plus Monitor Report 2013 the collective current account of Greece Ireland Italy Portugal and Spain is improving rapidly and is expected to balance by mid 2013 Thereafter these countries as a group would no longer need to import capital In 2014 the current account surplus of the eurozone as a whole almost doubled compared to the previous year reaching a new record high of 2279bn Euros Mobilisation of credit Several proposals were made in mid2012 to purchase the debt of distressed European countries such as Spain and Italy Markus Brunnermeier the economist Graham Bishop and Daniel Gros were among those advancing proposals Finding a formula which was not simply backed by Germany is central in crafting an acceptable and effective remedy Commentary US President Barack Obama stated in June 2012 Right now Europes focus has to be on strengthening their overall banking systemmaking a series of decisive actions that give people confidence that the banking system is solid In addition theyre going to have to look at how do they achieve growth at the same time as theyre carrying out structural reforms that may take two or three or five years to fully accomplish So countries like Spain and Italy for example have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessaryeverything from tax collection to labour markets to a whole host of different issues But theyve got to have the time and the space for those steps to succeed And if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up and people are pulling back further from spending money because theyre feeling a lot of pressureironically that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term In addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances theres a parallel discussion thats taking place among European leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root The Economist wrote in June 2012 Outside Germany a consensus has developed on what Mrs Merkel must do to preserve the single currency It includes shifting from austerity to a far greater focus on economic growth complementing the single currency with a Banking union of the European Union with eurowide deposit insurance bank oversight and joint means for the recapitalisation or resolution of failing banks and embracing a limited form of debt mutualisation to create a joint safe asset and allow peripheral economies the room gradually to reduce their debt burdens This is the refrain from Washington Beijing London and indeed most of the capitals of the euro zone Why hasnt the continents canniest politician sprung into action Proposed longterm solutions The key policy issue that has to be addressed in the long run is how to harmonise different politicaleconomic institutional setups of the north and south European economies to promote economic growth and make the currency union sustainable The Eurozone member states must adopt structural reforms aimed at promoting labour market mobility and wage flexibility restoring the souths economies competitiveness by increasing their productivity At the same time it is vital to keep in mind that just putting emphasis on emulating LMEs wagesetting system to CMEs and mixedmarket economies will not work Therefore apart from wage issues structural reforms should be focused on developing capacities for innovations technologies education RD etc ie all institutional subsystems crucial for firms success In economies of the south special attention should be given to creating less labourintensive industries to avoid price competition pressure from emerging lowcost countries such as China via an exchange rate channel and providing a smooth transition of workers from old unsustainable industries to new ones based on the socalled Nordicstyle flexicurity market model European fiscal union The crisis is pressuring Europe to move beyond a regulatory state and towards a more federal EU with fiscal powers Increased European integration giving a central body increased control over the budgets of member states was proposed on 14 June 2012 by Jens Weidmann President of the Deutsche Bundesbank expanding on ideas first proposed by JeanClaude Trichet former president of the European Central Bank Control including requirements that taxes be raised or budgets cut would be exercised only when fiscal imbalances developed This proposal is similar to contemporary calls by Angela Merkel for increased political and fiscal union which would allow Europe oversight possibilities European bank recovery and resolution authority European banks are estimated to have incurred losses approaching 1 trillion between 2007 and 2010 The European Commission approved some 45 billion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011 a sum which includes the value of taxpayerfunded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis On 6 June 2012 the European Commission adopted a legislative proposal for a harmonised bank recovery and resolution mechanism The proposed framework sets out the necessary steps and powers to ensure that bank failures across the EU are managed in a way that avoids financial instability The new legislation would give member states the power to impose losses resulting from a bank failure on the bondholders to minimise costs for taxpayers The proposal is part of a new scheme in which banks will be compelled to bailin their creditors whenever they fail the basic aim being to prevent taxpayerfunded bailouts in the future The public authorities would also be given powers to replace the management teams in banks even before the lender fails Each institution would also be obliged to set aside at least one per cent of the deposits covered by their national guarantees for a special fund to finance the resolution of banking crisis starting in 2018 Eurobonds A growing number of investors and economists say eurobonds would be the best way of solving a debt crisis though their introduction matched by tight financial and budgetary coordination may well require changes in EU treaties On 21 November 2011 the European Commission suggested that eurobonds issued jointly by the 17 euro nations would be an effective way to deal with the financial crisis Using the term stability bonds Jose Manuel Barroso insisted that any such plan would have to be matched by tight fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination as an essential counterpart so as to avoid moral hazard and ensure sustainable public finances Germany remains largely opposed at least in the short term to a collective takeover of the debt of states that have run excessive budget deficits and borrowed excessively over the past years European Safe Bonds A group of economists from Princeton University suggest a new form of European Safe Bonds ESBies ie bundled European government bonds 70 senior bonds 30 junior bonds in the form of a unionwide safe asset without joint liability According to the authors ESBies would be at least as safe as German bonds and approximately double the supply of euro safe assets when protected by a 30thick junior tranche ESBies could be issued by public or privatesector entities and would weaken the diabolic loop and its diffusion across countries It requires no significant change in treaties or legislation In 2017 the idea was picked up by the European Central Bank The European Commission has also shown interest and plans to include ESBies in a future white paper dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis The European Commission has recently introduced a proposal to introduce what it calls Sovereign Bond Backed Securities SBBS which are essentially the same as ESBies and the European Parliament endorsed the changes in regulations necessary to facilitate these securities in April 2019 European Monetary Fund On 20 October 2011 the Austrian Institute of Economic Research published an article that suggests transforming the EFSF into a European Monetary Fund EMF which could provide governments with fixed interest rate Eurobonds at a rate slightly below mediumterm economic growth in nominal terms These bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the EMF and liquidated at any time Given the backing of all eurozone countries and the ECB the EMU would achieve a similarly strong position visvis financial investors as the US where the Fed backs government bonds to an unlimited extent To ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure the EMF would operate according to strict rules providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria Governments lacking sound financial policies would be forced to rely on traditional national governmental bonds with less favourable market rates The econometric analysis suggests that If the shortterm and long term interest rates in the euro area were stabilised at 15 and 3 respectively aggregate output GDP in the euro area would be 5 percentage points above baseline in 2015 At the same time sovereign debt levels would be significantly lower with eg Greeces debt level falling below 110 of GDP more than 40 percentage points below the baseline scenario with marketbased interest levels Furthermore banks would no longer be able to benefit unduly from intermediary profits by borrowing from the ECB at low rates and investing in government bonds at high rates Debt writeoff financed by wealth tax According to the Bank for International Settlements the combined private and public debt of 18 OECD countries nearly quadrupled between 1980 and 2010 and will likely continue to grow reaching between 250 for Italy and about 600 for Japan by 2040 A BIS study released in June 2012 warns that budgets of most advanced economies excluding interest payments would need 20 consecutive years of surpluses exceeding 2 per cent of gross domestic productstarting nowjust to bring the debttoGDP ratio back to its precrisis level The same authors found in a previous study that increased financial burden imposed by ageing populations and lower growth makes it unlikely that indebted economies can grow out of their debt problem if only one of the following three conditions is met government debt is more than 80 to 100 of GDP nonfinancial corporate debt is more than 90 of GDP private household debt is more than 85 of GDP The first condition suggested by an influential paper written by Kenneth Rogoff Carmen Reinhart has been disputed due to major calculation errors In fact the average GDP growth at public debtGDP ratios over 90 is not dramatically different from when debtGDP ratios are lower The Boston Consulting Group BCG adds that if the overall debt load continues to grow faster than the economy then largescale debt restructuring becomes inevitable To prevent a vicious upward debt spiral from gaining momentum the authors urge policymakers to act quickly and decisively and aim for an overall debt level well below 180 for the private and government sector This number is based on the assumption that governments nonfinancial corporations and private households can each sustain a debt load of 60 of GDP at an interest rate of five per cent and a nominal economic growth rate of three per cent per year Lower interest rates andor higher growth would help reduce the debt burden further To reach sustainable levels the eurozone must reduce its overall debt level by 61 trillion According to BCG this could be financed by a onetime wealth tax of between 11 and 30 for most countries apart from the crisis countries particularly Ireland where a writeoff would have to be substantially higher The authors admit that such programmes would be drastic unpopular and require broad political coordination and leadership but they maintain that the longer politicians and central bankers wait the more necessary such a step will be Thomas Piketty French economist and author of the bestselling book Capital in the TwentyFirst Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity inefficient and unjust and inflation only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital According to his analysis a flat tax of 15 percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a years worth national income which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt Instead of a onetime writeoff German economist Harald Spehl has called for a 30year debtreduction plan similar to the one Germany used after World War II to share the burden of reconstruction and development Similar calls have been made by political parties in Germany including the Greens and The Left Debt writeoff based on international agreement In 2015 HansWerner Sinn president of German Ifo Institute for Economic Research called for a debt relief for Greece In addition economists from London School of Economics suggested a debt relief similar to the London agreement In 1953 private sector lenders as well as governments agreed to write off about half of West Germanys outstanding debt this was followed by the beginning of Germanys economic miracle or Wirtschaftswunder According to this agreement West Germany had to make repayments only when it was running a trade surplus that is when it had earned the money to pay up rather than having to borrow more or dip into its foreign currency reserves Its repayments were also limited to 3 of export earnings As LSE researchers note this had the effect that Germanys creditors had an incentive to buy the countrys goods so that it would be able to afford to pay them Controversies The European bailouts are largely about shifting exposure from banks and others who otherwise are lined up for losses on the sovereign debt they have piled up onto European taxpayers EU treaty violations No bailout clause The EUs Maastricht Treaty contains juridical language that appears to rule out intraEU bailouts First the no bailout clause Article 125 TFEU ensures that the responsibility for repaying public debt remains national and prevents risk premiums caused by unsound fiscal policies from spilling over to partner countries The clause thus encourages prudent fiscal policies at the national level The European Central Banks purchase of distressed country bonds can be viewed as violating the prohibition of monetary financing of budget deficits Article 123 TFEU The creation of further leverage in EFSF with access to ECB lending would also appear to violate the terms of this article Articles 125 and 123 were meant to create disincentives for EU member states to run excessive deficits and state debt and prevent the moral hazard of overspending and lending in good times They were also meant to protect the taxpayers of the other more prudent member states By issuing bailout aid guaranteed by prudent eurozone taxpayers to rulebreaking eurozone countries such as Greece the EU and eurozone countries also encourage moral hazard in the future While the no bailout clause remains in place the no bailout doctrine seems to be a thing of the past Convergence criteria The EU treaties contain so called convergence criteria specified in the protocols of the Treaties of the European Union As regards government finance the states agreed that the annual government budget deficit should not exceed 3 of gross domestic product GDP and that the gross government debt to GDP should not exceed 60 of GDP see protocol 12 and 13 For eurozone members there is the Stability and Growth Pact which contains the same requirements for budget deficit and debt limitation but with a much stricter regime In the past many European countries have substantially exceeded these criteria over a long period of time Around 2005 most eurozone members violated the pact resulting in no action taken against violators Credit rating agencies The international USbased credit rating agenciesMoodys Standard Poors and Fitchwhich have already been under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisishave also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis On one hand the agencies have been accused of giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest On the other hand ratings agencies have a tendency to act conservatively and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble In the case of Greece the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such According to a study by economists at St Gallen University credit rating agencies have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009 The authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their judgments on average rating Portugal Ireland and Greece 23 notches lower than under precrisis standards eventually forcing them to seek international aid On a side note as of the end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard Poor ie Germany Finland and Luxembourg European policy makers have criticised ratings agencies for acting politically accusing the Big Three of bias towards European assets and fuelling speculation Particularly Moodys decision to downgrade Portugals foreign debt to the category Ba2 junk has infuriated officials from the EU and Portugal alike Stateowned utility and infrastructure companies like ANA Aeroportos de Portugal Energias de Portugal Redes Energticas Nacionais and Brisa Autoestradas de Portugal were also downgraded despite claims to having solid financial profiles and significant foreign revenue French central bank chief Christian Noyer criticised the decision of Standard Poors to lower the rating of France but not that of the United Kingdom which has more deficits as much debt more inflation less growth than us Similar comments were made by highranking politicians in Germany Michael Fuchs deputy leader of the leading Christian Democrats said Standard and Poors must stop playing politics Why doesnt it act on the highly indebted United States or highly indebted Britain adding that the latters collective private and public sector debts are the largest in Europe He further added If the agency downgrades France it should also downgrade Britain in order to be consistent Credit rating agencies were also accused of bullying politicians by systematically downgrading eurozone countries just before important European Council meetings As one EU source put it It is interesting to look at the downgradings and the timings of the downgradings It is strange that we have so many downgrades in the weeks of summits Regulatory reliance on credit ratings Thinktanks such as the World Pensions Council WPC have criticised European powers such as France and Germany for pushing for the adoption of the Basel II recommendations adopted in 2005 and transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive CRD effective since 2008 In essence this forced European banks and more importantly the European Central Bank eg when gauging the solvency of EUbased financial institutions to rely heavily on the standardised assessments of credit risk marketed by only two private US firms Moodys and SP Counter measures Due to the failures of the ratings agencies European regulators obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies With the creation of the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions including the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA which became the EUs single creditratings firm regulator Creditratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on EU territory says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor Germanys foreign minister Guido Westerwelle called for an independent European ratings agency which could avoid the conflicts of interest that he claimed USbased agencies faced European leaders are reportedly studying the possibility of setting up a European ratings agency in order that the private USbased ratings agencies have less influence on developments in European financial markets in the future According to German consultant company Roland Berger setting up a new ratings agency would cost 300 million On 30 January 2012 the company said it was already collecting funds from financial institutions and business intelligence agencies to set up an independent nonprofit ratings agency by mid2012 which could provide its first country ratings by the end of the year In April 2012 in a similar attempt the Bertelsmann Stiftung presented a blueprint for establishing an international nonprofit credit rating agency INCRA for sovereign debt structured in way that management and rating decisions are independent from its financiers But attempts to regulate credit rating agencies more strictly in the wake of the eurozone crisis have been rather unsuccessful World Pensions Council WPC financial law and regulation experts have argued that the hastily drafted unevenly transposed in national law and poorly enforced EU rule on ratings agencies Regulation EC N 10602009 has had little effect on the way financial analysts and economists interpret data or on the potential for conflicts of interests created by the complex contractual arrangements between credit rating agencies and their clients Influence of anglosaxon media coverage Some in the Greek Spanish and French press and elsewhere spread conspiracy theories that claimed that the US and Britain were deliberately promoting rumors about the euro in order to cause its collapse or to distract attention from their own economic vulnerabilities The Economist rebutted these AngloSaxon conspiracy claims writing that although American and British traders overestimated the weakness of southern European public finances and the probability of the breakup of the eurozone these sentiments were an ordinary market panic rather than some deliberate plot Greek Prime Minister Papandreou is quoted as saying that there was no question of Greece leaving the euro and suggested that the crisis was politically as well as financially motivated This is an attack on the eurozone by certain other interests political or financial The Spanish Prime Minister Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero has also suggested that the recent financial market crisis in Europe is an attempt to undermine the euro He ordered the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia intelligence service National Intelligence Centre CNI in Spanish to investigate the role of the AngloSaxon media in fomenting the crisis So far no results have been reported from this investigation Other commentators believe that the euro is under attack so that countries such as the UK and the US can continue to fund their large external deficits and government deficits and to avoid the collapse of the US The US and UK do not have large domestic savings pools to draw on and therefore are dependent on external savings eg from China This is not the case in the eurozone which is selffunding Speculators Both the Spanish and Greek Prime Ministers have accused financial speculators and hedge funds of worsening the crisis by short selling euros German chancellor Merkel has stated that institutions bailed out with public funds are exploiting the budget crisis in Greece and elsewhere Goldman Sachs and other banks faced an inquiry by the Federal Reserve over their derivatives arrangements with Greece The Guardian reported that Goldman was reportedly the most heavily involved of a dozen or so Wall Street banks that assisted the Greek government in the early 2000s to structure complex derivatives deals early in the decade and borrow billions of dollars in exchange rate swaps which did not officially count as debt under eurozone rules Critics of the banks conduct said that these deals contributed to unsustainable public finances which in turn destabilized the eurozone In response to accusations that speculators were worsening the problem some markets banned naked short selling for a few months Speculation about the breakup of the eurozone Some economists mostly from outside Europe and associated with Modern Monetary Theory and other postKeynesian schools condemned the design of the euro currency system from the beginning because it ceded national monetary and economic sovereignty but lacked a central fiscal authority When faced with economic problems they maintained Without such an institution EMU would prevent effective action by individual countries and put nothing in its place US economist Martin Feldstein went so far to call the euro an experiment that failed Some nonKeynesian economists such as Luca A Ricci of the IMF contend that the eurozone does not fulfil the necessary criteria for an optimum currency area though it is moving in that direction As the debt crisis expanded beyond Greece these economists continued to advocate albeit more forcefully the disbandment of the eurozone If this was not immediately feasible they recommended that Greece and the other debtor nations unilaterally leave the eurozone default on their debts regain their fiscal sovereignty and readopt national currencies Bloomberg suggested in June 2011 that if the Greek and Irish bailouts should fail an alternative would be for Germany to leave the eurozone to save the currency through depreciation instead of austerity The likely substantial fall in the euro against a newly reconstituted Deutsche Mark would give a huge boost to its members competitiveness Iceland not part of the EU is regarded as one of Europes recovery success stories It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency which has effectively reduced wages by 50 making exports more competitive Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by currency devaluations a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment Swedens floating rate currency gives it a shortterm advantage structural reforms and constraints account for longerterm prosperity Labour concessions a minimal reliance on public debt and tax reform helped to further a progrowth policy British discount retailer Poundland chose the name Dealz and not Euroland for its 2011 expansion into Ireland because CEO Jim McCarthy said Eurozone is usually reported in association with bad news job losses debts and increased taxes His company planned to use Dealz in continental Europe McCarthy stated that There is less certainty about the longevity of the currency union now The Wall Street Journal conjectured as well that Germany could return to the Deutsche Mark or create another currency union with the Netherlands Austria Finland Luxembourg and other European countries such as Denmark Norway Sweden Switzerland and the Baltics A monetary union of these countries with current account surpluses would create the worlds largest creditor bloc bigger than China or Japan The Wall Street Journal added that without the Germanled bloc a residual euro would have the flexibility to keep interest rates low and engage in quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus in support of a jobtargeting economic policy instead of inflation targeting in the current configuration Breakup vs deeper integration There is opposition in this view The national exits are expected to be an expensive proposition The breakdown of the currency would lead to insolvency of several euro zone countries a breakdown in intrazone payments Having instability and the public debt issue still not solved the contagion effects and instability would spread into the system Having that the exit of Greece would trigger the breakdown of the eurozone this is not welcomed by many politicians economists and journalists According to Steven Erlanger from The New York Times a Greek departure is likely to be seen as the beginning of the end for the whole euro zone project a major accomplishment whatever its faults in the postWar construction of a Europe whole and at peace Likewise the two big leaders of the Euro zone German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy have said on numerous occasions that they would not allow the eurozone to disintegrate and have linked the survival of the Euro with that of the entire European Union In September 2011 EU commissioner Joaqun Almunia shared this view saying that expelling weaker countries from the euro was not an option Those who think that this hypothesis is possible just do not understand our process of integration The former ECB president JeanClaude Trichet also denounced the possibility of a return of the Deutsche Mark The challenges to the speculation about the breakup or salvage of the eurozone is rooted in its innate nature that the breakup or salvage of eurozone is not only an economic decision but also a critical political decision followed by complicated ramifications that If Berlin pays the bills and tells the rest of Europe how to behave it risks fostering destructive nationalist resentment against Germany and it would strengthen the camp in Britain arguing for an exita problem not just for Britons but for all economically liberal Europeans Solutions which involve greater integration of European banking and fiscal management and supervision of national decisions by European umbrella institutions can be criticised as Germanic domination of European political and economic life According to US author Ross Douthat This would effectively turn the European Union into a kind of postmodern version of the old AustroHungarian Empire with a Germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations The Economist provides a somewhat modified approach to saving the euro in that a limited version of federalisation could be less miserable solution than breakup of the euro The recipe to this tricky combination of the limited federalisation greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting the fiscal integration In order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy the overindebted countries require access to money and for banks to have a safe eurowide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country which could be obtained by narrower Eurobond that mutualises a limited amount of debt for a limited amount of time The proposition made by German Council of Economic Experts provides detailed blue print to mutualise the current debts of all eurozone economies above 60 of their GDP Instead of the breakup and issuing new national governments bonds by individual eurozone governments everybody from Germany debt 81 of GDP to Italy 120 would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the 60 threshold The new mutualisedbond market worth some 23 trillion would be paid off over the next 25 years Each country would pledge a specified tax such as a VAT surcharge to provide the cash So far German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed all forms of mutualisation The HungarianAmerican business magnate George Soros warns in Does the Euro have a Future that there is no escape from the gloomy scenario of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozones political cohesion so long as the authorities persist in their current course He argues that to save the Euro longterm structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a fullfledged European Treasury Following the formation of the Treasury the European Council could then authorise the ECB to step into the breach with risks to the ECBs solvency being indemnified Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate a radical change of heart In particular he cautions Germans will be wary of any such move not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it Soros writes that a collapse of the European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus the only way to avert another Great Depression is the formation of a European Treasury Odious debt Some protesters commentators such as Libration correspondent Jean Quatremer and the Ligebased NGO Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt CADTM allege that the debt should be characterised as odious debt The Greek documentary Debtocracy and a book of the same title and content examine whether the recent Siemens scandal and uncommercial ECB loans which were conditional on the purchase of military aircraft and submarines are evidence that the loans amount to odious debt and that an audit would result in invalidation of a large amount of the debt Manipulation of public finances statistics The revision of Greeces 2009 budget deficit from a forecast of 68 of GDP to 154 in 2010 was the key trigger for the Greek debt crisis However accusations of the use of creative accounting by several other governments have been raised the United Kingdom Spain the United States and even Germany Collateral for Finland On 18 August 2011 as requested by the Finnish parliament as a condition for any further bailouts it became apparent that Finland would receive collateral from Greece enabling it to participate in the potential new 109 billion support package for the Greek economy Austria the Netherlands Slovenia and Slovakia responded with irritation over this special guarantee for Finland and demanded equal treatment across the eurozone or a similar deal with Greece so as not to increase the risk level over their participation in the bailout The main point of contention was that the collateral is aimed to be a cash deposit a collateral the Greeks can only give by recycling part of the funds loaned by Finland for the bailout which means Finland and the other eurozone countries guarantee the Finnish loans in the event of a Greek default Finlands recommendation to the crisis countries is to issue assetbacked securities to cover the immediate need a tactic successfully used in Finlands early 1990s recession in addition to spending cuts and bad banking After extensive negotiations to implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries on 4 October 2011 a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached The expectation is that only Finland will utilise it due in part to a requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time Finland as one of the strongest AAA countries can raise the required capital with relative ease In February 2012 the four largest Greek banks agreed to provide the 880 million in collateral to Finland to secure the second bailout programme Political impact The handling of the crisis has led to the premature end of several European national governments and influenced the outcome of many elections Ireland February 2011 After a high deficit in the governments budget in 2010 and the uncertainty surrounding the proposed bailout from the International Monetary Fund the 30th Dil parliament collapsed the following year which led to a subsequent general election collapse of the preceding government parties Fianna Fil and the Green Party the resignation of the Taoiseach Brian Cowen and the rise of the Fine Gael party which formed a government alongside the Labour Party in the 31st Dil which led to a change of government and the appointment of Enda Kenny as Taoiseach Portugal March 2011 Following the failure of parliament to adopt the government austerity measures PM Jos Scrates and his government resigned bringing about early elections in June 2011 Finland April 2011 The approach to the Portuguese bailout and the EFSF dominated the April 2011 election debate and formation of the subsequent government Spain July 2011 Following the failure of the Spanish government to handle the economic situation PM Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero announced early elections in November It is convenient to hold elections this fall so a new government can take charge of the economy in 2012 fresh from the balloting he said Following the elections Mariano Rajoy became PM Slovenia September 2011 Following the failure of June referendums on measures to combat the economic crisis and the departure of coalition partners the Borut Pahor government lost a motion of confidence and December 2011 early elections were set following which Janez Jana became PM After a year of rigorous saving measures and also due to continuous opening of ideological question the centreright government of Janez Jana was ousted on 27 February 2013 by nomination of Alenka Bratuek as the PMdesignated of a new centreleft coalition government Slovakia October 2011 In return for the approval of the EFSF by her coalition partners PM Iveta Radiov had to concede early elections in March 2012 following which Robert Fico became PM Italy November 2011 Following market pressure on government bond prices in response to concerns about levels of debt the rightwing cabinet of the longtime prime minister Silvio Berlusconi lost its majority Berlusconi resigned on 12 November and four days later was replaced by the technocratic government of Mario Monti Greece November 2011 After intense criticism from within his own party the opposition and other EU governments for his proposal to hold a referendum on the austerity and bailout measures PM George Papandreou of the PASOK party announced his resignation in favour of a national unity government between three parties of which only two currently remain in the coalition Following the vote in the Greek parliament on the austerity and bailout measures which both leading parties supported but many MPs of these two parties voted against Papandreou and Antonis Samaras expelled a total of 44 MPs from their respective parliamentary groups leading to PASOK losing its parliamentary majority The early Greek legislative election 2012 were the first time in the history of the country at which the bipartisanship consisted of PASOK and New Democracy parties which ruled the country for over 40 years collapsed in votes as a punishment for their support to the strict measures proposed by the countrys foreign lenders and the Troika consisted of the European Commission the IMF and the European Central Bank The popularity of PASOK dropped from 425 in 2010 to as low as 7 in some polls in 2012 The radical rightwing extreme leftwing communist and populist political parties that have opposed the policy of strict measures won the majority of the votes Netherlands April 2012 After talks between the VVD CDA and PVV over a new austerity package of about 14 billion euros failed the Rutte cabinet collapsed Early elections were called for 12 September 2012 To prevent fines from the EU a new budget was demanded by 30 April five different parties called the Kunduz coalition forged together an emergency budget for 2013 in just

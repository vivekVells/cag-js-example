      "Albert Einstein EYENstyne German albt antan 14 March 1879 18 April 1955 was a Germanborn theoretical physicist who is widely held as one of the most influential scientists Best known for developing the theory of relativity Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics His massenergy equivalence formula E mc2 which arises from special relativity has been called the worlds most famous equation He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect Born in the German Empire Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895 forsaking his German citizenship as a subject of the Kingdom of Wrttemberg the following year In 1897 at the age of seventeen he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich graduating in 1900 In 1901 he acquired Swiss citizenship which he kept for the rest of his life In 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern In 1905 he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich In 1914 he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917 he also became a German citizen again this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia In 1933 while Einstein was visiting the United States Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews Einstein decided to remain in the US and was granted American citizenship in 1940 On the eve of World War II he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommended that the US begin similar research Einstein supported the Allies though he generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay In 1905 he published four groundbreaking papers sometimes described as his annus mirabilis miracle year These papers outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect explained Brownian motion introduced his special theory of relativity and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct mass and energy are equivalent to each other In 1915 he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole In 1917 Einstein wrote a paper which laid the foundations for the concepts of both laser and maser and contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on A joint paper in 1935 with Nathan Rosen introduced the notion of a wormhole In the middle part of his career Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation in which light consists of particles subsequently called photons With the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose he laid the groundwork for BoseEinstein statistics For much of the last phase of his academic life Einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful First he advocated against quantum theorys introduction of fundamental randomness into sciences picture of the world objecting that God does not play dice Second he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism As a result he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream modern physics His intellectual achievements and originality made Einstein broadly synonymous with genius In 1999 he was named Times Person of the Century Life and career Childhood youth and education Albert Einstein was born in Ulm in the Kingdom of Wrttemberg in the German Empire on 14 March 1879 His parents secular Ashkenazi Jews were Hermann Einstein a salesman and engineer and Pauline Koch In 1880 the family moved to Munichs borough of LudwigsvorstadtIsarvorstadt where Einsteins father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J Einstein Cie a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current He often related a formative event from his youth when he was sick in bed and his father brought him a compass This sparked his lifelong fascination with electromagnetism He realized that Something deeply hidden had to be behind things Albert attended St Peters Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five When he was eight he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education In 1894 Hermann and Jakobs company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich but without successthey lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to the more efficient alternating current alternative The failure of their bid forced them to sell their Munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere The Einstein family moved to Italy first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani Einstein then fifteen stayed behind in Munich in order to finish his schooling His father wanted him to study electrical engineering but he was a fractious pupil who found the Gymnasiums regimen and teaching methods far from congenial He later wrote that the schools policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity At the end of December 1894 a letter from a doctor persuaded the Luitpolds authorities to release him from its care and he joined his family in Pavia While in Italy as a teenager he wrote an essay entitled On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field Einstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior He began teaching himself algebra calculus and Euclidean geometry when he was twelve he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday A family tutor Max Talmud said that only a short time after he had given the twelve year old Einstein a geometry textbook the boy had worked through the whole book He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow Einstein recorded that he had mastered integral and differential calculus while still just fourteen His love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve he was already confident that nature could be understood as a mathematical structure At thirteen when his range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy Talmud introduced Einstein to Kants Critique of Pure Reason Kant became his favorite philosopher according to Talmud At the time he was still a child only thirteen years old yet Kants works incomprehensible to ordinary mortals seemed to be clear to him In 1895 at the age of sixteen Einstein sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school later the Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule ETH in Zurich Switzerland He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics On the advice of the polytechnics principal he completed his secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school a gymnasium in Aarau Switzerland graduating in 1896 While lodging in Aarau with the family of Jost Winteler he fell in love with Wintelers daughter Marie His sister Maja later married Wintelers son Paul In January 1896 with his fathers approval Einstein renounced his citizenship of the German Kingdom of Wrttemberg in order to avoid conscription into military service The Matura graduation for the successful completion of higher secondary schooling awarded to him in September 1896 acknowledged him to have performed well across most of the curriculum allotting him a top grade of 6 for history physics algebra geometry and descriptive geometry At seventeen he enrolled in the fouryear mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school Marie Winteler a year older than him took up a teaching post in Olsberg Switzerland The five other polytechnic school freshmen following the same course as Einstein included just one woman a twenty year old Serbian Mileva Mari Over the next few years the pair spent many hours discussing their shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the polytechnic schools lectures did not cover In his letters to Mari Einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude Eventually the two students became not only friends but also lovers Historians of physics are divided on the question of the extent to which Mari contributed to the insights of Einsteins annus mirabilis publications There is at least some evidence that he was influenced by her scientific ideas but there are scholars who doubt whether her impact on his thought was of any great significance at all Marriages relationships and children Correspondence between Einstein and Mari discovered and published in 1987 revealed that in early 1902 while Mari was visiting her parents in Novi Sad she gave birth to a daughter Lieserl When Mari returned to Switzerland it was without the child whose fate is uncertain A letter of Einsteins that he wrote in September 1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy Einstein and Mari married in January 1903 In May 1904 their son Hans Albert was born in Bern Switzerland Their son Eduard was born in Zurich in July 1910 In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before Eduards arrival he described his love for his wife as misguided and mourned the missed life that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be In 1912 Einstein entered into a relationship with Elsa Lwenthal who was both his first cousin on his mothers side and his second cousin on his fathers When Mari learned of his infidelity soon after moving to Berlin with him in April 1914 she returned to Zurich taking Hans Albert and Eduard with her Einstein and Mari were granted a divorce on 14 February 1919 on the grounds of having lived apart for five years As part of the divorce settlement Einstein agreed that if he were to win a Nobel Prize he would give the money that he received to Mari he won the prize two years later Einstein married Lwenthal in 1919 In 1923 he began a relationship with a secretary named Betty Neumann the niece of his close friend Hans Mhsam Lwenthal nevertheless remained loyal to him accompanying him when he emigrated to the United States in 1933 In 1935 she was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems She died in December 1936 A volume of Einsteins letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006 added further names to the catalog of women with whom he was romantically involved They included Margarete Lebach a married Austrian Estella Katzenellenbogen the rich owner of a florist business Toni Mendel a wealthy Jewish widow and Ethel Michanowski a Berlin socialite with whom he spent time and from whom he accepted gifts while married to Lwenthal After being widowed Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova thought by some to be a Russian spy her husband the Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton Following an episode of acute mental illness at about the age of twenty Einsteins son Eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia He spent the remainder of his life either in the care of his mother or in temporary confinement in an asylum After her death he was committed permanently to Burghlzli the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich 19021909 Assistant at the Swiss Patent Office Einstein graduated from the federal polytechnic school in 1900 duly certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics His successful acquisition of Swiss citizenship in February 1901 was not followed by the usual sequel of conscription the Swiss authorities deemed him medically unfit for military service He found that Swiss schools too appeared to have no use for him failing to offer him a teaching position despite the almost two years that he spent applying for one Eventually it was with the help of Marcel Grossmanns father that he secured a post in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office as an assistant examiner level III Patent applications that landed on Einsteins desk for his evaluation included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter His employers were pleased enough with his work to make his position permanent in 1903 although they did not think that he should be promoted until he had fully mastered machine technology It is conceivable that his labors at the patent office had a bearing on his development of his special theory of relativity He arrived at his revolutionary ideas about space time and light through thought experiments about the transmission of signals and the synchronization of clocks matters which also figured in some of the inventions submitted to him for assessment In 1902 Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern formed a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy Their choice of a name for their club the Olympia Academy was an ironic comment upon its far from Olympian status Sometimes they were joined by Mari who limited her participation in their proceedings to careful listening The thinkers whose works they reflected upon included Henri Poincar Ernst Mach and David Hume all of whom significantly influenced Einsteins own subsequent ideas and beliefs 19001905 First scientific papers Einsteins first paper Folgerungen aus den Capillarittserscheinungen Conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity in which he proposed a model of intermolecular attraction that he afterwards disavowed as worthless was published in the journal Annalen der Physik in 1901 His 24page doctoral dissertation also addressed a topic in molecular physics Titled Eine neue Bestimmung der Molekldimensionen A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions and dedicated to his friend Marcel Grossman it was completed on 30 April 1905 and approved by Professor Alfred Kleiner of the University of Zurich three months later Einstein was formally awarded his PhD on 15 January 1906 Four other pieces of work that Einstein completed in 1905his famous papers on the photoelectric effect Brownian motion his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energyhave led to the year being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics akin to 1666 the year in which Isaac Newton experienced his greatest epiphanies The publications deeply impressed Einsteins contemporaries 19081933 Early academic career Einsteins sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908 when he secured a junior teaching position at the University of Bern In 1909 a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the University of Zurich much admired by Alfred Kleiner led to Zurichs luring him away from Bern with a newly created associate professorship Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911 when he accepted a chair at the German CharlesFerdinand University in Prague a move which required him to become an Austrian citizen of the AustroHungarian Empire His time in Prague saw him producing eleven research papers In July 1912 he returned to his alma mater the ETH Zurich to take up a chair in theoretical physics His teaching activities there centred on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics and his research interests included the molecular theory of heat continuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation In his work on the latter topic he was assisted by his friend Marcel Grossmann whose knowledge of the kind of mathematics required was greater than his own In the spring of 1913 two German visitors Max Planck and Walther Nernst called upon Einstein in Zurich in the hope of persuading him to relocate to Berlin They offered him membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences the directorship of the planned Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and a chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial salary but with no teaching duties to burden him Their invitation was all the more appealing to him because Berlin happened to be the home of his latest girlfriend Elsa Lwenthal He duly joined the Academy on 24 July 1913 and moved into an apartment in the Berlin district of Dahlem on 1 April 1914 He was installed in his Humboldt University position shortly thereafter The outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 marked the beginning of Einsteins gradual estrangement from the nation of his birth When the Manifesto of the NinetyThree was published in October 1914a document signed by a host of prominent German thinkers that justified Germanys belligerenceEinstein was one of the few German intellectuals to distance himself from it and sign the alternative eirenic Manifesto to the Europeans instead However this expression of his doubts about German policy did not prevent him from being elected to a twoyear term as president of the German Physical Society in 1916 When the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics opened its doors the following yearits foundation delayed because of the warEinstein was appointed its first director just as Planck and Nernst had promised Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1920 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1921 In 1922 he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to Theoretical Physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect At this point some physicists still regarded the general theory of relativity skeptically and the Nobel citation displayed a degree of doubt even about the work on photoelectricity that it acknowledged it did not assent to Einsteins notion of the particulate nature of light which only won over the entire scientific community when S N Bose derived the Planck spectrum in 1924 That same year Einstein was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Britains closest equivalent of the Nobel award the Royal Societys Copley Medal was not hung around Einsteins neck until 1925 He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1930 Einstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933 His accomplishments in Berlin had included the completion of the general theory of relativity proving the Einsteinde Haas effect contributing to the quantum theory of radiation and the development of BoseEinstein statistics 1919 Putting general relativity to the test In 1907 Einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of his equivalence principle which asserts that an observer in an infinitesimally small box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that the field exists In 1911 he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Suns photosphere that is the Suns apparent surface He reworked his calculation in 1913 having now found a way to model gravitation with the Riemann curvature tensor of a nonEuclidean fourdimensional spacetime By the fall of 1915 his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of Riemannian geometry was complete and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the Sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon the precession of the perihelion of Mercury a slow drift in the point in Mercurys elliptical orbit at which it approaches the Sun most closely A total eclipse of the Sun that took place on 29 May 1919 provided an opportunity to put his theory of gravitational lensing to the test and observations performed by Sir Arthur Eddington yielded results that were consistent with his calculations Eddingtons work was reported at length in newspapers around the world On 7 November 1919 for example the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read Revolution in Science New Theory of the Universe Newtonian Ideas Overthrown 19211923 Coming to terms with fame With Eddingtons eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well Einstein became perhaps the worlds first celebrity scientist a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century Einstein began his new life as an intellectual icon in America where he arrived on 2 April 1921 He was welcomed to New York City by Mayor John Francis Hylan and then spent three weeks giving lectures and attending receptions He spoke several times at Columbia University and Princeton and in Washington he visited the White House with representatives of the National Academy of Sciences He returned to Europe via London where he was the guest of the philosopher and statesman Viscount Haldane He used his time in the British capital to meet several people prominent in British scientific political or intellectual life and to deliver a lecture at Kings College In July 1921 he published an essay My First Impression of the USA in which he sought to sketch the American character much as had Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in America 1835 He wrote of his transatlantic hosts in highly approving terms What strikes a visitor is the joyous positive attitude to life The American is friendly selfconfident optimistic and without envy In 1922 Einsteins travels were to the old world rather than the new He devoted six months to a tour of Asia that saw him speaking in Japan Singapore and Sri Lanka then known as Ceylon After his first public lecture in Tokyo he met Emperor Yoshihito and his wife at the Imperial Palace with thousands of spectators thronging the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of him In a letter to his sons he wrote that Japanese people seemed to him to be generally modest intelligent and considerate and to have a true appreciation of art But his picture of them in his diary was less flattering the intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones natural disposition His journal also contains views of China and India which were uncomplimentary Of Chinese people he wrote that even the children are spiritless and look obtuse It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary He was greeted with even greater enthusiasm on the last leg of his tour in which he spent twelve days in Mandatory Palestine newly entrusted to British rule by the League of Nations in the aftermath of the First World War Sir Herbert Samuel the British High Commissioner welcomed him with a degree of ceremony normally only accorded to a visiting head of state including a cannon salute One reception held in his honor was stormed by people determined to hear him speak he told them that he was happy that Jews were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world Einsteins decision to tour the eastern hemisphere in 1922 meant that he was unable to go to Stockholm in the December of that year to participate in the Nobel prize ceremony His place at the traditional Nobel banquet was taken by a German diplomat who gave a speech praising him not only as a physicist but also as a campaigner for peace A twoweek visit to Spain that he undertook in 1923 saw him collecting another award a membership of the Spanish Academy of Sciences signified by a diploma handed to him by King Alfonso XIII His Spanish trip also gave him a chance to meet a fellow Nobel laureate the neuroanatomist Santiago Ramn y Cajal 19221932 Serving the League of Nations From 1922 until 1932 with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924 Einstein was a member of the Genevabased International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations a group set up by the League to encourage scientists artists scholars teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries He was appointed as a German delegate rather than as a representative of Switzerland because of the machinations of two Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta By persuading Secretary General Eric Drummond to deny Einstein the place on the committee reserved for a Swiss thinker they created an opening for Gonzague de Reynold who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrine Einsteins former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee 1925 Touring South America In March and April 1925 Einstein and his wife visited South America where they spent about a week in Brazil a week in Uruguay and a month in Argentina Their tour was suggested by Jorge Duclout 18561927 and Mauricio Nirenstein 18771935 with the support of several Argentine scholars including Julio Rey Pastor Jakob Laub and Leopoldo Lugones and was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and the Asociacin Hebraica Argentina Argentine Hebraic Association with a smaller contribution from the ArgentineGermanic Cultural Institution 19301931 Touring the US In December 1930 Einstein began another significant sojourn in the United States drawn back to the US by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology Caltech supported him in his wish that he should not be exposed to quite as much attention from the media as he had experienced when visiting the US in 1921 and he therefore declined all the invitations to receive prizes or make speeches that his admirers poured down upon him But he remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with him that they requested After arriving in New York City Einstein was taken to various places and events including Chinatown a lunch with the editors of The New York Times and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival During the days following he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met Nicholas Murray Butler the president of Columbia University who described Einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind Harry Emerson Fosdick pastor at New Yorks Riverside Church gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a fullsize statue that the church made of Einstein standing at the entrance Also during his stay in New York he joined a crowd of 15000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration Einstein next traveled to California where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A Millikan His friendship with Millikan was awkward as Millikan had a penchant for patriotic militarism where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist During an address to Caltechs students Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin both noted for their pacifism Carl Laemmle head of Universal Studios gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin They had an instant rapport with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife Elsa to his home for dinner Chaplin said Einsteins outward persona calm and gentle seemed to conceal a highly emotional temperament from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy Chaplins film City Lights was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests Walter Isaacson Einsteins biographer described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his modest little flat and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory Chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis 1933 Emigration to the US In February 1933 while on a visit to the United States Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germanys new chancellor Adolf Hitler While at American universities in early 1933 he undertook his third twomonth visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena In February and March 1933 the Gestapo repeatedly raided his familys apartment in Berlin He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March and during the trip they learned that the German Reichstag had passed the Enabling Act on 23 March transforming Hitlers government into a de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin Later on they heard that their cottage had been raided by the Nazis and Einsteins personal sailboat confiscated Upon landing in Antwerp Belgium on 28 March Einstein immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport formally renouncing his German citizenship The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp Refugee status In April 1933 Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions including teaching at universities Historian Gerald Holton describes how with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed A month later Einsteins works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming Jewish intellectualism is dead One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase not yet hanged offering a 5000 bounty on his head In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born who had already emigrated from Germany to England Einstein wrote I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise After moving to the US he described the book burnings as a spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment and more than anything else in the world fear the influence of men of intellectual independence Einstein was now without a permanent home unsure where he would live and work and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany Aided by the Academic Assistance Council founded in April 1933 by British Liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics escape Nazi persecution Einstein was able to leave Germany He rented a house in De Haan Belgium where he lived for a few months In late July 1933 he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver LockerLampson who had become friends with him in the preceding years LockerLampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a secluded wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton Norfolk To protect Einstein LockerLampson had two bodyguards watch over him a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933 LockerLampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home and later Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately and sent his friend physicist Frederick Lindemann to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out they had lowered their technical standards and put the Allies technology ahead of theirs Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations including Turkeys Prime Minister smet nn to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed GermanJewish scientists As a result of Einsteins letter Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over 1000 saved individuals LockerLampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe In one of his speeches he denounced Germanys treatment of Jews while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere In his speech he described Einstein as a citizen of the world who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK Both bills failed however and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton New Jersey US to become a resident scholar Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study On 3 October 1933 Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in London with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany At the time most American universities including Harvard Princeton and Yale had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students as a result of their Jewish quotas which lasted until the late 1940s Einstein was still undecided about his future He had offers from several European universities including Christ Church Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a fiveyear research fellowship called a studentship at Christ Church but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship Einsteins affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955 He was one of the four first selected along with John von Neumann Kurt Gdel and Hermann Weyl at the new Institute He soon developed a close friendship with Gdel the two would take long walks together discussing their work Bruria Kaufman his assistant later became a physicist During this period Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics both unsuccessfully He lived in Princeton at his home from 1935 onwards The Albert Einstein House was made a National Historic Landmark in 1976 World War II and the Manhattan Project In 1939 a group of Hungarian scientists that included migr physicist Le Szilrd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research The groups warnings were discounted Einstein and Szilrd along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon To make certain the US was aware of the danger in July 1939 a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe Szilrd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs which Einstein a pacifist said he had never considered He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter with Szilrd to President Roosevelt recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research The letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the US adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the US entry into World War II In addition to the letter Einstein used his connections with the Belgian royal family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White Houses Oval Office Some say that as a result of Einsteins letter and his meetings with Roosevelt the US entered the race to develop the bomb drawing on its immense material financial and scientific resources to initiate the Manhattan Project For Einstein war was a disease and he called for resistance to war By signing the letter to Roosevelt some argue he went against his pacifist principles In 1954 a year before his death Einstein said to his old friend Linus Pauling I made one great mistake in my lifewhen I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made but there was some justificationthe danger that the Germans would make them In 1955 Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists including British philosopher Bertrand Russell signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons In 1960 Einstein was included posthumously as a charter member of the World Academy of Art and Science WAAS an organization founded by distinguished scientists and intellectuals who committed themselves to the responsible and ethical advances of science particularly in light of the development of nuclear weapons US citizenship Einstein became an American citizen in 1940 Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton New Jersey he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe He recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers As a result individuals were encouraged he said to be more creative a trait he valued from his early education Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP in Princeton where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans He considered racism Americas worst disease seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next As part of his involvement he corresponded with civil rights activist W E B Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial as an alleged foreign agent in 1951 When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois the judge decided to drop the case In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania a historically black college where he was awarded an honorary degree Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall Einstein gave a speech about racism in America adding I do not intend to be quiet about it A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student Einstein has said Being a Jew myself perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination Personal views Political views In 1918 Einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the German Democratic Party a liberal party Later in his life Einsteins political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism which he detailed in his essays such as Why Socialism His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time In 1925 he criticized them for not having a wellregulated system of government and called their rule a regime of terror and a tragedy in human history He later adopted a more moderated view criticizing their methods but praising them which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin In Lenin I honor a man who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice I do not find his methods advisable One thing is certain however men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankinds conscience Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nationstates in the framework of a world federation He wrote I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932 by the time of his death it was 1427 pages long Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi with whom he corresponded He described Gandhi as a role model for the generations to come The initial connection was established on 27 September 1931 when Wilfrid Israel took his Indian guest V A Sundaram to meet his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh Sundaram was Gandhis disciple and special envoy whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leaders home in 1925 During the visit Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped the direct connection between them was established through Wilfrid Israel Relationship with Zionism Einstein was a figurehead leader in the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem which opened in 1925 Earlier in 1921 he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization Chaim Weizmann to help raise funds for the planned university He made suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria which he called an evil that was undermining a third of the countrys development He also promoted the establishment of an Oriental Studies Institute to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic Einstein was not a nationalist and opposed the creation of an independent Jewish state He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine The state of Israel was established without his help in 1948 Einstein was limited to a marginal role in the Zionist movement Upon the death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952 Prime Minister David BenGurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of President of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach The offer was presented by Israels ambassador in Washington Abba Eban who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons Einstein wrote that he was deeply moved but at once saddened and ashamed that he could not accept it Religious and philosophical views Per Lee Smolin I believe what allowed Einstein to achieve so much was primarily a moral quality He simply cared far more than most of his colleagues that the laws of physics have to explain everything in nature coherently and consistently Einstein expounded his spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinozas philosophy He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings a view which he described as nave He clarified however that I am not an atheist preferring to call himself an agnostic or a deeply religious nonbeliever He wrote that A spirit is manifest in the laws of the universea spirit vastly superior to that of man and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort Einstein was primarily affiliated with nonreligious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association which publishes New Humanist in Britain For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism He observed Without ethical culture there is no salvation for humanity In a Germanlanguage letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind dated 3 January 1954 Einstein wroteThe word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the Bible a collection of honorable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish No interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people I cannot see anything chosen about them Einstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time In a letter in 1930 to Hermann Huth vicepresident of the German Vegetarian Federation Deutsche VegetarierBund he wroteAlthough I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind He became a vegetarian himself only during the last part of his life In March 1954 he wrote in a letter So I am living without fats without meat without fish but am feeling quite well this way It almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore Love of music Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age In his late journals he wrote If I were not a physicist I would probably be a musician I often think in music I live my daydreams in music I see my life in terms of music I get most joy in life out of music His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture According to conductor Leon Botstein Einstein began playing when he was 5 However he did not enjoy it at that age When he turned 13 he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart whereupon he became enamored of Mozarts compositions and studied music more willingly Einstein taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically He said that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty At the age of 17 he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethovens violin sonatas The examiner stated afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of great insight What struck the examiner writes Botstein was that Einstein displayed a deep love of the music a quality that was and remains in short supply Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einsteins life from that period on Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals including Kurt Appelbaum and he performed for private audiences and friends Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern Zurich and Berlin where he played with Max Planck and his son among others He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Kchel catalog of Mozarts work that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein who may have been a distant relation In 1931 while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles where he played some of Beethoven and Mozarts works with members of the Zoellner Quartet Near the end of his life when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton he played his violin with them and the quartet was impressed by Einsteins level of coordination and intonation Death On 17 April 1955 Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948 He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israels seventh anniversary with him to the hospital but he did not live to complete it Einstein refused surgery saying I want to go when I want It is tasteless to prolong life artificially I have done my share it is time to go I will do it elegantly He died in the Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76 having continued to work until near the end During the autopsy the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einsteins brain for preservation without the permission of his family in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent Einsteins remains were cremated in Trenton New Jersey and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters nuclear physicist J Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn Einstein bequeathed his personal archives library and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel Scientific career Throughout his life Einstein published hundreds of books and articles He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 nonscientific ones On 5 December 2014 universities and archives announced the release of Einsteins papers comprising more than 30000 unique documents In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the BoseEinstein statistics the Einstein refrigerator and others Statistical mechanics Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics Einsteins first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction It was published in 1901 with the title Folgerungen aus den Capillarittserscheinungen which translates as Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena Two papers he published in 19021903 thermodynamics attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena Theory of critical opalescence Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density At the critical point this derivative is zero leading to large fluctuations The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered making the fluid look milky white Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength and which explains why the sky is blue Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter 1905 Annus Mirabilis papers The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect which gave rise to quantum theory Brownian motion the special theory of relativity and E mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905 These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space time and matter The four papers are Special relativity Einsteins Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Krper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year It reconciled conflicts between Maxwells equations the laws of electricity and magnetism and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics Observationally the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einsteins special theory of relativity This paper predicted that when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aetherone of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the timewas superfluous In his paper on massenergy equivalence Einstein produced E mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations Einsteins 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years but was accepted by leading physicists starting with Max Planck Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics the study of moving bodies In 1908 Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime Einstein adopted Minkowskis formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity General relativity General relativity and the equivalence principle General relativity GR is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915 According to it the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape As Einstein later said the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion even accelerated ones should appear more satisfactory Consequently in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity In that article titled On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It he argued that free fall is really inertial motion and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply This argument is called the equivalence principle In the same article Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing In 1911 Einstein published another article On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light expanding on the 1907 article in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies Thus the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally Gravitational waves In 1916 Einstein predicted gravitational waves ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves traveling outward from the source transporting energy as gravitational radiation The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it By contrast gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed The first indirect detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars PSR B191316 The explanation for the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves Einsteins prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016 when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves detected on Earth on 14 September 2015 nearly one hundred years after the prediction Hole argument and Entwurf theory While developing general relativity Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only In June 1913 the Entwurf draft theory was the result of these investigations As its name suggests it was a sketch of a theory less elegant and more difficult than general relativity with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions After more than two years of intensive work Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915 Physical cosmology In 1917 Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic either contracting or expanding As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time Einstein introduced a new term the cosmological constant into the field equations in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature in accordance with Einsteins understanding of Machs principle in these years This model became known as the Einstein World or Einsteins static universe Following the discovery of the recession of the galaxies by Edwin Hubble in 1929 Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos the FriedmannEinstein universe of 1931 and the Einsteinde Sitter universe of 1932 In each of these models Einstein discarded the cosmological constant claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory In many Einstein biographies it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have received from him The astrophysicist Mario Livio has cast doubt on this claim In late 2013 a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac ORaifeartaigh discovered evidence that shortly after learning of Hubbles observations of the recession of the galaxies Einstein considered a steadystate model of the universe In a hitherto overlooked manuscript apparently written in early 1931 Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter a process that he associated with the cosmological constant As he stated in the paper In what follows I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation 1 that can account for Hubbels sic facts and in which the density is constant over time If one considers a physically bounded volume particles of matter will be continually leaving it For the density to remain constant new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space It thus appears that Einstein considered a steadystate model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle Bondi and Gold However Einsteins steadystate model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea Energy momentum pseudotensor General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum Noethers theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noethers prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field While the use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was criticized by Erwin Schrdinger and others Einsteins approach has been echoed by physicists including Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz Wormholes In 1935 Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole often called EinsteinRosen bridges His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations in line with the program outlined in the paper Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches Because these solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body Einstein and Rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles However it was later found that EinsteinRosen bridges are not stable EinsteinCartan theory In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part called the torsion This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s Equations of motion In general relativity gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straightline path but rather the bodys attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory Spacetime tells matter how to move matter tells spacetime how to curve The Einstein field equations cover the latter aspect of the theory relating the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy The geodesic equation covers the former aspect stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime Einstein regarded this as an independent fundamental assumption that had to be postulated in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory Believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally presented he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves Since the equations of general relativity are nonlinear a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields like a black hole would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves not by a new law Accordingly Einstein proposed that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution like a black hole to be a geodesic Both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity but this claim remains disputed Old quantum theory Photons and energy quanta In a 1905 paper Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles quanta Einsteins light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists including Max Planck and Niels Bohr This idea only became universally accepted in 1919 with Robert Millikans detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect and with the measurement of Compton scattering Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each where h is the Planck constant He did not say much more because he was not sure how the particles were related to the wave But he did suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results notably the photoelectric effect Light quanta were dubbed photons by Gilbert N Lewis in 1926 Quantized atomic vibrations In 1907 Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator In the Einstein model each atom oscillates independentlya series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics Peter Debye refined this model BoseEinstein statistics In 1924 Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles Einstein noted that Boses statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles and submitted his translation of Boses paper to the Zeitschrift fr Physik Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications among them the BoseEinstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultracooling equipment built at the NISTJILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder BoseEinstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons Einsteins sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University Waveparticle duality Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906 he had not given up on academia In 1908 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern In ber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen ber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation on the quantization of light and in an earlier 1909 paper Einstein showed that Max Plancks energy quanta must have welldefined momenta and act in some respects as independent pointlike particles This paper introduced the photon concept and inspired the notion of waveparticle duality in quantum mechanics Einstein saw this waveparticle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new unified foundation Zeropoint energy In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913 Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zeropoint energy in his second quantum theory Soon this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zeropoint energy they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data The numbers matched nicely However after publishing the findings they promptly withdrew their support because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zeropoint energy Stimulated emission In 1917 at the height of his work on relativity Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Plancks distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws Matter waves Einstein discovered Louis de Broglies work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first In another major paper from this era Einstein observed that de Broglie waves could explain the quantization rules of Bohr and Sommerfeld This paper would inspire Schrdingers work of 1926 Quantum mechanics Einsteins objections to quantum mechanics Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect However he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925 despite its acceptance by other physicists He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism stating that God is not playing at dice Until the end of his life he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete Bohr versus Einstein The BohrEinstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr who were two of its founders Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics EinsteinPodolskyRosen paradox Einstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics While he recognized that it made correct predictions he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible Over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with Bohr in 1930 Einstein suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other The quantummechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction If the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given then the Schrdinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction But because of what would later be called quantum entanglement measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object no matter how far away it is Moreover the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast Indeed he argued physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another and such instantaneous influences would call that into question Because the true physical condition of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first Einstein concluded the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition only an incomplete description of it A more famous version of this argument came in 1935 when Einstein published a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox In this thought experiment two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled Then no matter how far the two particles were separated a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict perfectly the result of measuring the position of the other particle Likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle without needing to disturb the other particle in any way They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light which is forbidden by the theory of relativity They invoked a principle later known as the EPR criterion of reality positing that If without in any way disturbing a system we can predict with certainty ie with probability equal to unity the value of a physical quantity then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity From this they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured But quantum mechanics considers these two observables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system Einstein Podolsky and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality In 1964 John Stewart Bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further He deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated This constraint would later be called a Bell inequality Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality Consequently the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are nonlocal which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated Bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality the EPR paradox is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least Despite this and although Einstein personally found the argument in the EPR paper overly complicated that paper became among the most influential papers published in Physical Review It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory Unified field theory Encouraged by his success with general relativity Einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity In 1950 he described his unified field theory in a Scientific American article titled On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation His attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not success a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces neither of which was well understood until many years after his death Although most researchers now believe that Einsteins approach to unifying physics was mistaken his goal of a theory of everything is one to which his successors still aspire Other investigations Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned These pertain to force superconductivity and other research Collaboration with other scientists In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld Nathan Rosen Peter Bergmann and others Einstein also had some oneshot collaborations with various scientists Einsteinde Haas experiment In 1908 Owen Willans Richardson predicted that a change in the magnetic moment of a free body will cause this body to rotate This effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas published two papers in 1915 claiming the first experimental observation of the effect Measurements of this kind demonstrate that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment polarization of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization These measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons The Einsteinde Haas experiment is the only experiment concived realized and published by Albert Einstein himself A complete original version of the Einsteinde Haas experimental equipment was donated by Geertruida de HaasLorentz wife of de Haas and daughter of Lorentz to the Ampre Museum in Lyon France in 1961 where it is currently on display It was lost among the museums holdings and was rediscovered in 2023 Einstein as an inventor In 1926 Einstein and his former student Le Szilrd coinvented and in 1930 patented the Einstein refrigerator This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input On 11 November 1930 US patent 1781541 was awarded to Einstein and Le Szilrd for the refrigerator Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production but the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux Einstein also invented an electromagnetic pump sound reproduction device and several other household devices Legacy Nonscientific While traveling Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death she died in 1986 Barbara Wolff of the Hebrew Universitys Albert Einstein Archives told the BBC that there are about 3500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 Einsteins right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California Although the court initially held that the right had expired that ruling was immediately appealed and the decision was later vacated in its entirety The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled The right is enforceable and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right Corbis successor to The Roger Richman Agency licenses the use of his name and associated imagery as agent for the university Mount Einstein in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named in 1955 Mount Einstein in New Zealands Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Scientific In 1999 a survey of the top 100 physicists voted for Einstein as the greatest physicist ever while a survey of rankandfile physicists gave the top spot to Isaac Newton with Einstein second Physicist Lev Landau ranked physicists from 0 to 5 on a logarithmic scale of productivity and genius with Newton and Einstein belonging in a super league with Newton receiving the highest ranking of 0 followed by Einstein with 05 while fathers of quantum mechanics such as Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac were ranked 1 with Landau himself a 2 Physicist Eugene Wigner noted that while John von Neumann had the quickest and acute mind he ever knew the understanding of Einstein was deeper than von Neumanns further stating that Einsteins mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumanns The year 2005 was labeled the World Year of Physics and was also known as Einstein Year in recognition of Einsteins miracle year in 1905 In popular culture Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities after the confirmation of his general theory of relativity in 1919 Although most of the public had little understanding of his work he was widely recognized and admired In the period before World War II The New Yorker published a vignette in their The Talk of the Town feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory Eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else Pardon me sorry Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels films plays and works of music He is a favorite model for depictions of absentminded professors his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated Time magazines Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was a cartoonists dream come true Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him Awards and honors Einstein received numerous awards and honors and in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to Theoretical Physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922 Einsteinium a synthetic chemical element was named in his honor in 1955 a few months

      "Artificial intelligence AI in its broadest sense is intelligence exhibited by machines particularly computer systems It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals Such machines may be called AIs Highprofile applications of AI include advanced web search engines eg Google Search recommendation systems used by YouTube Amazon and Netflix virtual assistants eg Google Assistant Siri and Alexa autonomous vehicles eg Waymo generative and creative tools eg ChatGPT and AI art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and Go However many AI applications are not perceived as AI A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled AI anymore Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and support for robotics General intelligencethe ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal levelis among the fields longterm goals To reach these goals AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics AI also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as AI winter Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI known as the AI boom The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and longterm effects in the future prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology Goals The general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research Reasoning and problemsolving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions By the late 1980s and 1990s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion They become exponentially slower as the problems grow Even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early AI research could model They solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem Knowledge representation Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts Formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program An ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications Planning and decisionmaking An agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen In automated planning the agent has a specific goal In automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid The decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it For each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility In classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be In most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked In some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved These can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action A policy associates a decision with each possible state The policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically It has been a part of AI from the beginning There are several kinds of machine learning Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization Natural language processing Natural language processing NLP allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as English Specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering Early work based on Noam Chomskys generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others In 2019 generative pretrained transformer or GPT language models began to generate coherent text and by 2023 these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam SAT test GRE test and many other realworld applications Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input The field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognitionobject tracking and robotic perception Social intelligence Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood For example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction However this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence Techniques AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions There are two very different kinds of search used in AI state space search and local search State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state For example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers The result is a search that is too slow or never completes Heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal Adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or Go It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position Local search Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks Another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation Formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as Every X is a Y and There are some Xs that are Ys Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises Proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules Given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms In the case of Horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem In the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved Inference in both Horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable However backward reasoning with Horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog is Turing complete Moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages Fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between 0 and 1 It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true Nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning Many problems in AI including in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory These tools include models such as Markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design Bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the Bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic Bayesian networks Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden Markov models or Kalman filters Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match They can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning Each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set When a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience There are many kinds of classifiers in use The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm Knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid1990s and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine SVM displaced knearest neighbor in the 1990s The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at Google due in part to its scalability Neural networks are also used as classifiers Artificial neural networks An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain It is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data There is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data In theory a neural network can learn any function In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks Perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each otherthis is especially important in image processing where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object Deep learning Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs The multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input For example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023 The sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the 1950s but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to GPUs and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as ImageNet GPT Generative pretrained transformers GPT are large language models LLMs that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences Textbased GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet The pretraining consists of predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation Throughout this pretraining GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token Typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data They are used in chatbots which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text Current models and services include Gemini formerly Bard ChatGPT Grok Claude Copilot and LLaMA Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data modalities such as images videos sound and text Hardware and software In the late 2010s graphics processing units GPUs that were increasingly designed with AIspecific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit CPUs as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research but generalpurpose programming languages like Python have become predominant The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 monthsa trend known as Moores law named after the Intel cofounder Gordon Moore who first identified it Improvements in GPUs have been even faster Applications AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s including search engines such as Google Search targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by Netflix YouTube or Amazon driving internet traffic targeted advertising AdSense Facebook virtual assistants such as Siri or Alexa autonomous vehicles including drones ADAS and selfdriving cars automatic language translation Microsoft Translator Google Translate facial recognition Apples Face ID or Microsofts DeepFace and Googles FaceNet and image labeling used by Facebook Apples iPhoto and TikTok The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer CAO Health and medicine The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients For medical research AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways For example AlphaFold 2 2021 demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the 3D structure of a protein In 2023 it was reported that AIguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria In 2024 researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinsons disease drug treatments Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises Parkinsons disease They were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AIenabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction AIintegrated sex toys eg teledildonics AIgenerated sexual education content and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners eg Replika AI is also used for the production of nonconsensual deepfake pornography raising significant ethical and legal concerns AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online genderbased violence and online sexual grooming of minors Games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AIs most advanced techniques Deep Blue became the first computer chessplaying system to beat a reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov on 11 May 1997 In 2011 in a Jeopardy quiz show exhibition match IBMs question answering system Watson defeated the two greatest Jeopardy champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings by a significant margin In March 2016 AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol becoming the first computer Goplaying system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps Then in 2017 it defeated Ke Jie who was the best Go player in the world Other programs handle imperfectinformation games such as the pokerplaying program Pluribus DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models such as with MuZero which could be trained to play chess Go or Atari games In 2019 DeepMinds AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II a particularly challenging realtime strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map In 2021 an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition winning against four of the worlds best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning In 2024 Google DeepMind introduced SIMA a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen openworld video games by observing screen output as well as executing short specific tasks in response to natural language instructions Mathematics In mathematics special forms of formal stepbystep reasoning are used In contrast LLMs such as GPT4 Turbo Gemini Ultra Claude Opus LLaMa2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models which can produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations Therefore they need not only a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised finetuning or trained classifiers with humanannotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections A 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data Alternatively dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as Alpha Tensor Alpha Geometry and Alpha Proof all from Google DeepMind Llemma from eleuther or Julius When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems converters transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests others to serve as educational tools in mathematics Finance Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance where automated robot advisers have been in use for some years World Pensions experts like Nicolas Firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AIinformed financial products and services the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking financial planning and pension advice in the process but Im not sure it will unleash a new wave of eg sophisticated pension innovation Military Various countries are deploying AI military applications The main applications enhance command and control communications sensors integration and interoperability Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis logistics cyber operations information operations and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors threat detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria In November 2023 US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology Generative AI In the early 2020s generative AI gained widespread prominence GenAI is AI capable of generating text images videos or other data using generative models often in response to prompts In March 2023 58 of US adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14 had tried it The increasing realism and easeofuse of AIbased texttoimage generators such as Midjourney DALLE and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AIgenerated photos Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat the fictional arrest of Donald Trump and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon as well as the usage in professional creative arts Agents Artificial intelligent AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment make decisions and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals These agents can interact with users their environment or other agents AI agents are used in various applications including virtual assistants chatbots autonomous vehicles gameplaying systems and industrial robotics AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming available computational resources and hardware limitations This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities In realworld applications AI agents often face time constraints for decisionmaking and action execution Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training Using machine learning AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks Other industryspecific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions In a 2017 survey one in five companies reported having incorporated AI in some offerings or processes A few examples are energy storage medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy or supply chain management AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS videos or social media Further AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions In agriculture AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments or increasing yield Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights For example it is used for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy Additionally it could be used for activities in space such as space exploration including the analysis of data from space missions realtime science decisions of spacecraft space debris avoidance and more autonomous operation During the 2024 Indian elections US50 millions was spent on authorized AIgenerated content notably by creating deepfakes of allied including sometimes deceased politicians to better engage with voters and by translating speeches to various local languages Ethics AI has potential benefits and potential risks AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else However as the use of AI has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified Inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy surveillance and copyright AIpowered devices and services such as virtual assistants and IoT products continuously collect personal information raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AIs ability to process and combine vast amounts of data potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records geolocation data video or audio For example in order to build speech recognition algorithms Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation deidentification and differential privacy Since 2016 some privacy experts such as Cynthia Dwork have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of what they know to the question of what theyre doing with it Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of fair use Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a robotstxt file In 2023 leading authors including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors Dominance by tech giants The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc Amazon Apple Inc Meta Platforms and Microsoft Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace Power needs and environmental impacts In January 2024 the International Energy Agency IEA released Electricity 2024 Analysis and Forecast to 2026 forecasting electric power use This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026 with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use and might delay closings of obsolete carbonemitting coal energy facilities There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US making large technology firms eg Microsoft Meta Google Amazon into voracious consumers of electric power Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search The large firms are in haste to find power sources from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion The tech firms argue that in the long view AI will be eventually kinder to the environment but they need the energy now AI makes the power grid more efficient and intelligent will assist in the growth of nuclear power and track overall carbon emissions according to technology firms A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge found US power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation and forecasts that by 2030 US data centers will consume 8 of US power as opposed to 3 in 2022 presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means Data centers need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all In 2024 the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclearpowered data center for 650 Million US Nvidia CEO JenHsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers In September 2024 Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100 of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years Reopening the plant which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979 will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission If approved this will be the first ever US recommissioning of a nuclear plant over 835 megawatts of power enough for 800000 homes of energy will be produced The cost for reopening and upgrading is estimated at 16 billion US and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost 2 billion US to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan Closed since 2022 the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025 The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation After the last approval in September 2023 Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024 due to power supply shortages Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025 On the other hand Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power but in 2022 lifted this ban Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese cloud gaming services company Ubitus in which Nvidia has a stake is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient cheap and stable power for AI On 1 November 2024 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazons data center According to the Commission Chairman Willie L Phillips it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors Misinformation YouTube Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation conspiracy theories and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the AI recommended more of it Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation This convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society After the US election in 2016 major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem In 2022 generative AI began to create images audio video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs recordings films or human writing It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates on a large scale among other risks Algorithmic bias and fairness Machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data The developers may not be aware that the bias exists Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people as it can in medicine finance recruitment housing or policing then the algorithm may cause discrimination The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases On June 28 2015 Google Photoss new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as gorillas because they were black The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people a problem called sample size disparity Google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla Eight years later in 2023 Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from Apple Facebook Microsoft and Amazon COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by US courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist In 2016 Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61 the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would reoffend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not reoffend In 2017 several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of reoffense were different for whites and blacks in the data A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender The feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender Moritz Hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesnt work Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist Thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past It is descriptive rather than prescriptive Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among AI engineers about 4 are black and 20 are women There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness These notions depend on ethical assumptions and are influenced by beliefs about society One broad category is distributive fairness which focuses on the outcomes often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases but it may conflict with antidiscrimination laws At its 2022 Conference on Fairness Accountability and Transparency ACM FAccT 2022 the Association for Computing Machinery in Seoul South Korea presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of selflearning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed Lack of transparency Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions Particularly with deep neural networks in which there are a large amount of nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs But some popular explainability techniques exist It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended For example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading People who have been harmed by an algorithms decision have a right to an explanation Doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make Early drafts of the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used DARPA established the XAI Explainable Artificial Intelligence program in 2014 to try to solve these problems Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output LIME can locally approximate a models outputs with a simpler interpretable model Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned Deconvolution DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning For generative pretrained transformers Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with humanunderstandable concepts Bad actors and weaponized AI Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors such as authoritarian governments terrorists criminals or rogue states A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction Even when used in conventional warfare it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person In 2014 30 nations including China supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons however the United States and others disagreed By 2015 over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance Machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlierAI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen For example machinelearning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment In the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with AI A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in longterm unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed Risk estimates vary for example in the 2010s Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47 of US jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an OECD report classified only 9 of US jobs as high risk The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies In April 2023 it was reported that 70 of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence Unlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence The Economist stated in 2015 that the worry that AI could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the Industrial Revolution is worth taking seriously Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative valuebased judgement Existential risk It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it This could as physicist Stephen Hawking stated spell the end of the human race This scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a humanlike selfawareness or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character These scifi scenarios are misleading in several ways First AI does not require humanlike sentience to be an existential risk Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of a paperclip factory manager Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead In order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side Second Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk The essential parts of civilization are not physical Things like ideologies law government money and the economy are made of language they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI Personalities such as Stephen Hawking Bill Gates and Elon Musk as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio Stuart Russell Demis Hassabis and Sam Altman have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI In May 2023 Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to freely speak out about the risks of AI without considering how this impacts Google He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI In 2023 many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war Other researchers however spoke in favor of a less dystopian view AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in 95 of all cases AI research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors Andrew Ng also argued that its a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AIand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests Yann LeCun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction In the early 2010s experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine However after 2016 the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research Ethical machines and alignment Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans Eliezer Yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005 Other approaches include Wendell Wallachs artificial moral agents and Stuart J Russells three principles for developing provably beneficial machines Open source Active organizations in the AI opensource community include Hugging Face Google EleutherAI and Meta Various AI models such as Llama 2 Mistral or Stable Diffusion have been made openweight meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available Openweight models can be freely finetuned which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own usecase Openweight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused Since they can be finetuned any builtin security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism and that once released on the Internet they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed They recommend prerelease audits and costbenefit analyses Frameworks Artificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing developing and implementing an AI system An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM valuesdeveloped by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely openly and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values justice and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI and the IEEEs Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative among others however these principles do not go without their criticisms especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called Inspect for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT opensource licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with thirdparty packages It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities Regulation The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally According to AI Index at Stanford the annual number of AIrelated laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone Between 2016 and 2020 more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI Most EU member states had released national AI strategies as had Canada China India Japan Mauritius the Russian Federation Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates US and Vietnam Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy including Bangladesh Malaysia and Tunisia The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020 stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology Henry Kissinger Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI In 2023 OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than 10 years In 2023 the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance the body comprises technology company executives governments officials and academics In 2024 the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI called the Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights Democracy and the Rule of Law It was adopted by the European Union the United States the United Kingdom and other signatories In a 2022 Ipsos survey attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country 78 of Chinese citizens but only 35 of Americans agreed that products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks A 2023 ReutersIpsos poll found that 61 of Americans agree and 22 disagree that AI poses risks to humanity In a 2023 Fox News poll 35 of Americans thought it very important and an additional 41 thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate AI versus 13 responding not very important and 8 responding not at all important In November 2023 the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks 28 countries including the United States China and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international cooperation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI History The study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity The study of logic led directly to Alan Turings theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning This along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI such as McCullouch and Pitts design for artificial neurons in 1943 and Turings influential 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence which introduced the Turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956 The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s They and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking English Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed writing that within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved They had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem In 1974 both the US and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects Minskys and Paperts book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving realworld tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether The AI winter a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult followed In the early 1980s AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars At the same time Japans fifth generation computer project inspired the US and British governments to restore funding for academic research However beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987 AI once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting winter began Up to this point most of AIs funding had gone to projects that used highlevel symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts In the 1980s some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition and began to look into subsymbolic approaches Rodney Brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive Judea Pearl Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic But the most important development was the revival of connectionism including neural network research by Geoffrey Hinton and others In 1990 Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems This narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics By 2000 solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used although in the 1990s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence a tendency known as the AI effect However several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines Beginning around 2002 they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or AGI which had several wellfunded institutions by the 2010s Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field For many specific tasks other methods were abandoned Deep learnings success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers graphics processing units cloud computing and access to large amounts of data including curated datasets such as ImageNet Deep learnings success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI The amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by 50 in the years 20152019 In 2016 issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers refocussed their careers on these issues The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study In the late teens and early 2020s AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest In 2015 AlphaGo developed by DeepMind beat the world champion Go player The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself GPT3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating highquality humanlike text These programs and others inspired an aggressive AI boom where large companies began investing billions in AI research According to AI Impacts about 50 billion annually was invested in AI around 2022 in the US alone and about 20 of the new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in AI About 800000 AIrelated US job openings existed in 2022 Philosophy Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious and the associated ethical implications Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI such as epistemology and free will Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI Defining artificial intelligence Alan Turing wrote in 1950 I propose to consider the question can machines think He advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour He devised the Turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure However they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans Aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons AI founder John McCarthy agreed writing that Artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence McCarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world Another AI founder Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals These definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible Another definition has been adopted by Google a major practitioner in the field of AI This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence Some authors have suggested in practice that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword often even if they did not actually use AI in a material way Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks This approach is mostly subsymbolic soft and narrow Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI or GOFAI simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics They were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or IQ tests In the 1960s Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action However the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning Moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for AI but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually AI research came to agree with him The issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because subsymbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision The emerging field of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches Neat vs scruffy Neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks Scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s but eventually was seen as irrelevant Modern AI has elements of both Soft vs hard computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems Soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks Narrow vs general AI AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow AI in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields longterm goals General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions The subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively Machine consciousness sentience and mind The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence Russell and Norvig add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on However the question has become central to the philosophy of mind It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction Consciousness David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something Dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion While human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain For example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like Computationalism and functionalism Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as strong AI The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals Sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or selfawareness may provide another moral basis for AI rights Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society In 2017 the European Union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable AI systems Similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own Progress in AI increased interest in the topic Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming which could lead to largescale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself The improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what I J Good called an intelligence explosion and Vernor Vinge called a singularity However technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an Sshaped curve slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either This idea called transhumanism has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger Edward Fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution an idea first proposed by Samuel Butlers Darwin among the Machines as far back as 1863 and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines The Evolution of Global Intelligence In fiction Thoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelleys Frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters This includes such works as Arthur C Clarkes and Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey both 1968 with HAL 9000 the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship as well as The Terminator 1984 and The Matrix 1999 In contrast the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still 1951 and Bishop from Aliens 1986 are less prominent in popular culture Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories most notably with the Multivac superintelligent computer Asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer This appears in Karel apeks RUR the films AI Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K Dick Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is

    title: "World War II",
    originalContent:
      "World War II or the Second World War 1 September 1939 2 September 1945 was a global conflict between two coalitions the Allies and the Axis powers Nearly all the worlds countriesincluding all the great powersparticipated with many investing all available economic industrial and scientific capabilities in pursuit of total war blurring the distinction between military and civilian resources Tanks and aircraft played major roles with the latter enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war World War II was the deadliest conflict in history resulting in 70 to 85 million deaths more than half being civilians Millions died in genocides including the Holocaust of European Jews as well as from massacres starvation and disease Following the Allied powers victory Germany Austria Japan and Korea were occupied and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders The causes of World War II included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of World War I and the rise of fascism in Europe and militarism in Japan Key events leading up to the war included Japans invasion of Manchuria the Spanish Civil War the outbreak of the Second SinoJapanese War and Germanys annexations of Austria and the Sudetenland World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939 when Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler invaded Poland prompting the United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union under the MolotovRibbentrop Pact in which they had agreed on spheres of influence in Eastern Europe In 1940 the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and parts of Finland and Romania After the fall of France in June 1940 the war continued mainly between Germany and the British Empire with fighting in the Balkans Mediterranean and Middle East the aerial Battle of Britain and the Blitz and naval Battle of the Atlantic Through a series of campaigns and treaties Germany took control of much of continental Europe and formed the Axis alliance with Italy Japan and other countries In June 1941 Germany led the European Axis in an invasion of the Soviet Union opening the Eastern Front and initially making large territorial gains Japan aimed to dominate East Asia and the AsiaPacific and by 1937 was at war with the Republic of China In December 1941 Japan attacked American and British territories in Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific including Pearl Harbor in Hawaii which resulted in the US and the UK declaring war against Japan and the European Axis declaring war on the US Japan conquered much of coastal China and Southeast Asia but its advances in the Pacific were halted in mid1942 after its defeat in the naval Battle of Midway Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union Key setbacks in 1943including German defeats on the Eastern Front the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland and Allied offensives in the Pacificcost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts In 1944 the Western Allies invaded Germanoccupied France at Normandy while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies westward At the same time Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key islands The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of Germanoccupied territories the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union culminating in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops Hitlers suicide and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945 Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration the US dropped the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago the possibility of further atomic bombings and the Soviet declaration of war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August and signed a surrender document on 2 September 1945 marking the end of the war World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world and it set the foundation of international relations for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century The United Nations was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts with the victorious great powersChina France the Soviet Union the UK and the USbecoming the permanent members of its security council The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers setting the stage for the Cold War In the wake of European devastation the influence of its great powers waned triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion Start and end dates World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and Frances declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939 Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second SinoJapanese War on 7 July 1937 or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria on 19 September 1931 Others follow the British historian A J P Taylor who stated that the SinoJapanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and the two wars became World War II in 1941 Other proposed starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935 The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939 Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II The exact date of the wars end also is not universally agreed upon It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 VJ Day rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945 which officially ended the war in Asia A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951 A 1990 treaty regarding Germanys future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most postWorld War II issues No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the SovietJapanese Joint Declaration of 1956 which also restored full diplomatic relations between them History Background Aftermath of World War I World War I had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the Central Powersincluding AustriaHungary Germany Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empireand the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia which led to the founding of the Soviet Union Meanwhile the victorious Allies of World War I such as France Belgium Italy Romania and Greece gained territory and new nationstates were created out of the dissolution of the AustroHungarian Ottoman and Russian Empires To prevent a future world war the League of Nations was established in 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference The organisations primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security military and naval disarmament as well as settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I irredentist and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several European states These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial colonial and financial losses imposed by the Treaty of Versailles Under the treaty Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions while German annexation of other states was prohibited reparations were imposed and limits were placed on the size and capability of the countrys armed forces Germany and Italy The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 19181919 and a democratic government later known as the Weimar Republic was created The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left Italy as an Entente ally had made some postwar territorial gains however Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement From 1922 to 1925 the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist totalitarian and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy repressed socialist leftwing and liberal forces and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power promising the creation of a New Roman Empire Adolf Hitler after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923 eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933 when Paul von Hindenburg and the Reichstag appointed him Following Hindenburgs death in 1934 Hitler proclaimed himself Fhrer of Germany and abolished democracy espousing a radical racially motivated revision of the world order and soon began a massive rearmament campaign France seeking to secure its alliance with Italy allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia which Italy desired as a colonial possession The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles accelerated his rearmament programme and introduced conscription European treaties The United Kingdom France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany a key step towards military globalisation however that June the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany easing prior restrictions The Soviet Union concerned by Germanys goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France Before taking effect though the FrancoSoviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations which rendered it essentially toothless The United States concerned with events in Europe and Asia passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year Hitler defied the Versailles and Locarno Treaties by remilitarising the Rhineland in March 1936 encountering little opposition due to the policy of appeasement In October 1936 Germany and Italy formed the RomeBerlin Axis A month later Germany and Japan signed the AntiComintern Pact which Italy joined the following year Asia The Kuomintang KMT party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid1920s but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party CCP allies and new regional warlords In 1931 an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the countrys right to rule Asia staged the Mukden incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo China appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria The two nations then fought several battles in Shanghai Rehe and Hebei until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933 Thereafter Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria and Chahar and Suiyuan After the 1936 Xian Incident the Kuomintang and CCP forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan Prewar events Italian invasion of Ethiopia 1935 The Second ItaloEthiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936 The war began with the invasion of the Ethiopian Empire also known as Abyssinia by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy Regno dItalia which was launched from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa Africa Orientale Italiana or AOI in addition it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations but the League did little when the former clearly violated Article X of the Leagues Covenant The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germanys goal of absorbing Austria Spanish Civil War 19361939 When civil war broke out in Spain Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the Nationalist rebels led by General Francisco Franco Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis Mussolini sent more than 70000 ground troops 6000 aviation personnel and 720 aircraft to Spain The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the Spanish Republic More than 30000 foreign volunteers known as the International Brigades also fought against the Nationalists Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939 Franco now dictator remained officially neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the Eastern Front Japanese invasion of China 1937 In July 1937 Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Peking after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge incident which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China The Soviets quickly signed a nonaggression pact with China to lend materiel support effectively ending Chinas prior cooperation with Germany From September to November the Japanese attacked Taiyuan engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai but after three months of fighting Shanghai fell The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937 After the fall of Nanking tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese In March 1938 Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at Taierzhuang but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by the Japanese in May In June 1938 Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan but the city was taken by October Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war SovietJapanese border conflicts In the midtolate 1930s Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia The Japanese doctrine of Hokushinron which emphasised Japans expansion northward was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939 the ongoing Second SinoJapanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941 and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshinron promoted by the Navy which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies European occupations and agreements In Europe Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive In March 1938 Germany annexed Austria again provoking little response from other European powers Encouraged Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands Soon afterwards Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary and Poland annexed the TransOlza region of Czechoslovakia Although all of Germanys stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish warmongers and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major buildup of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy In March 1939 Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a proGerman client state the Slovak Republic Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania on 20 March 1939 forcing the concession of the Klaipda Region formerly the German Memelland Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of Danzig the United Kingdom and France guaranteed their support for Polish independence when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939 the same guarantee was extended to the Kingdoms of Romania and Greece Shortly after the FrancoBritish pledge to Poland Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to encircle Germany and renounced the AngloGerman Naval Agreement and the GermanPolish declaration of nonaggression The situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border On 23 August the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression pact with Germany after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between France the United Kingdom and Soviet Union had stalled This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet spheres of influence western Poland and Lithuania for Germany eastern Poland Finland Estonia Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union and raised the question of continuing Polish independence The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a twofront war as it had in World War I Immediately afterwards Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality he decided to delay it In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war Germany made demands on Poland which served as a pretext to worsen relations On 29 August Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on secession The Poles refused to comply with the German demands and on the night of 3031 August in a confrontational meeting with the British ambassador Nevile Henderson Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected Course of the war War breaks out in Europe 19391940 On 1 September 1939 Germany invaded Poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defences at Westerplatte The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for Germany to cease military operations and on 3 September after the ultimatum was ignored Britain and France declared war on Germany During the Phoney War period the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany which aimed to damage the countrys economy and war effort Germany responded by ordering Uboat warfare against Allied merchant and warships which would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic On 8 September German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw The Polish counteroffensive to the west halted the German advance for several days but it was outflanked and encircled by the Wehrmacht Remnants of the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw On 17 September 1939 two days after signing a ceasefire with Japan the Soviet Union invaded Poland under the supposed pretext that the Polish state had ceased to exist On 27 September the Warsaw garrison surrendered to the Germans and the last large operational unit of the Polish Army surrendered on 6 October Despite the military defeat Poland never surrendered instead it formed the Polish governmentinexile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied Poland A significant part of Polish military personnel evacuated to Romania and Latvia many of them later fought against the Axis in other theatres of the war Germany annexed western Poland and occupied central Poland the Soviet Union annexed eastern Poland small shares of Polish territory were transferred to Lithuania and Slovakia On 6 October Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union The proposal was rejected and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather After the outbreak of war in Poland Stalin threatened Estonia Latvia and Lithuania with military invasion forcing the three Baltic countries to sign pacts allowing the creation of Soviet military bases in these countries in October 1939 significant Soviet military contingents were moved there Finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet Union The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939 and was subsequently expelled from the League of Nations for this crime of aggression Despite overwhelming numerical superiority Soviet military success during the Winter War was modest and the FinnoSoviet war ended in March 1940 with some Finnish concessions of territory In June 1940 the Soviet Union occupied the entire territories of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania as well as the Romanian regions of Bessarabia Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region In August 1940 Hitler imposed the Second Vienna Award on Romania which led to the transfer of Northern Transylvania to Hungary In September 1940 Bulgaria demanded Southern Dobruja from Romania with German and Italian support leading to the Treaty of Craiova The loss of onethird of Romanias 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal Ion Antonescu with a course set towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee Meanwhile GermanSoviet political relations and economic cooperation gradually stalled and both states began preparations for war Western Europe 19401941 In April 1940 Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden which the Allies were attempting to cut off Denmark capitulated after six hours and despite Allied support Norway was conquered within two months British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the resignation of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who was replaced by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940 On the same day Germany launched an offensive against France To circumvent the strong Maginot Line fortifications on the FrancoGerman border Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region which was mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles By successfully implementing new Blitzkrieg tactics the Wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the FrancoBelgian border near Lille The United Kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of Allied troops from the continent by early June although they had to abandon almost all their equipment On 10 June Italy invaded France declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom The Germans turned south against the weakened French army and Paris fell to them on 14 June Eight days later France signed an armistice with Germany it was divided into German and Italian occupation zones and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime which though officially neutral was generally aligned with Germany France kept its fleet which the United Kingdom attacked on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany The air Battle of Britain began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours The German campaign for air superiority started in August but its failure to defeat RAF Fighter Command forced the indefinite postponement of the proposed German invasion of Britain The German strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on London and other cities in the Blitz but largely ended in May 1941 after failing to significantly disrupt the British war effort Using newly captured French ports the German Navy enjoyed success against an overextended Royal Navy using Uboats against British shipping in the Atlantic The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck In November 1939 the United States was assisting China and the Western Allies and had amended the Neutrality Act to allow cash and carry purchases by the Allies In 1940 following the German capture of Paris the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases Still a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941 In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless calling for the United States to become an arsenal of democracy and promoting LendLease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the British war effort LendLease was later extended to the other Allies including the Soviet Union after it was invaded by Germany The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a fullscale offensive against Germany At the end of September 1940 the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan Italy and Germany as the Axis powers The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any countrywith the exception of the Soviet Unionthat attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary Slovakia and Romania joined Romania and Hungary later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union in Romanias case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union Mediterranean 19401941 In early June 1940 the Italian Regia Aeronautica attacked and besieged Malta a British possession From late summer to early autumn Italy conquered British Somaliland and made an incursion into Britishheld Egypt In October Italy attacked Greece but the attack was repulsed with heavy Italian casualties the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes To assist Italy and prevent Britain from gaining a foothold Germany prepared to invade the Balkans which would threaten Romanian oil fields and strike against British dominance of the Mediterranean In December 1940 British Empire forces began counteroffensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa The offensives were successful by early February 1941 Italy had lost control of eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission after a carrier attack at Taranto and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan Italian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to North Africa at the end of March 1941 Rommels Afrika Korps launched an offensive which drove back Commonwealth forces In less than a month Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and besieged the port of Tobruk By late March 1941 Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact however the Yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by proBritish nationalists Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both Yugoslavia and Greece commencing on 6 April 1941 both nations were forced to surrender within the month The airborne invasion of the Greek island of Crete at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans Partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia which continued until the end of the war In the Middle East in May Commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichycontrolled Syria Between June and July Britishled forces invaded and occupied the French possessions of Syria and Lebanon assisted by the Free French Axis attack on the Soviet Union 1941 With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable Germany Japan and the Soviet Union made preparations for war With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resourcerich European possessions in Southeast Asia the two powers signed the SovietJapanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941 By contrast the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union massing forces on the Soviet border Hitler believed that the United Kingdoms refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later On 31 July 1940 Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of Ukraine the Baltic states and Byelorussia However other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a EuroAsian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact In November 1940 negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland Bulgaria Turkey and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable On 18 December 1940 Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union On 22 June 1941 Germany supported by Italy and Romania invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them they were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region Moscow and Ukraine with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the ArkhangelskAstrakhan linefrom the Caspian to the White Seas Hitlers objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power exterminate Communism generate Lebensraum living space by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germanys remaining rivals Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counteroffensives before the war Operation Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt strategic defence During the summer the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel By midAugust however the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies and made possible further advance into Crimea and industriallydeveloped Eastern Ukraine the First Battle of Kharkov The diversion of threequarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy In July the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany and in August the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter which outlined British and American goals for the postwar world In late August the British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the Persian Corridor Irans oil fields and preempt any Axis advances through Iran toward the Baku oil fields or India By October Axis powers had achieved operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region with only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing A major offensive against Moscow was renewed after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend the offensive Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives two key cities remained in Soviet hands the Soviet capability to resist was not broken and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended By early December freshly mobilised reserves allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops This as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counteroffensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100250 kilometres 62155 mi west War breaks out in the Pacific 1941 Following the Japanese false flag Mukden incident in 1931 the Japanese shelling of the American gunboat USS Panay in 1937 and the 19371938 Nanjing Massacre JapaneseAmerican relations deteriorated In 1939 the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctionsthe Export Control Actswhich banned US exports of chemicals minerals and military parts to Japan and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime During 1939 Japan launched its first attack against Changsha but was repulsed by late September Despite several offensives by both sides by 1940 the war between China and Japan was at a stalemate To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina in September 1940 Chinese nationalist forces launched a largescale counteroffensive in early 1940 In August Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China in retaliation Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941 effectively ending their cooperation In March the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during Battle of Shanggao In September Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces German successes in Europe prompted Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan with oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941 In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East The United States the United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo At the same time Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East intending to take advantage of the German invasion in the west but abandoned the operation after the sanctions Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate At the same time the United States the United Kingdom and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946 and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any neighboring countries Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the AmericanBritishDutch sanctions Japan prepared for war Emperor Hirohito after initial hesitation about Japans chances of victory began to favour Japans entry into the war As a result Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned Hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni in his place choosing War Minister Hideki Tojo instead On 3 November Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl Harbor to the Emperor On 5 November Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war On 20 November the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan In exchange Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina The American counterproposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude nonaggression pacts with all Pacific powers That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force the Japanese military did not consider the former an option and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war Japan planned to seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the overstretched Allies by fighting a defensive war To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset On 7 December 1941 8 December in Asian time zones Japan attacked British and American holdings with nearsimultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific These included an attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines as well as invasions of Guam Wake Island Malaya Thailand and Hong Kong These attacks led the United States United Kingdom China Australia and several other states to formally declare war on Japan whereas the Soviet Union being heavily involved in largescale hostilities with European Axis countries maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan Germany followed by the other Axis states declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt Axis advance stalls 19421943 On 1 January 1942 the Allied Big Fourthe Soviet Union China the United Kingdom and the United Statesand 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers During 1942 Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective The Americans favoured a straightforward largescale attack on Germany through France The Soviets demanded a second front The British argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength leading to increasing demoralisation and bolstering resistance forces Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using largescale armies Eventually the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943 the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war in May 1943 the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944 Pacific 19421943 By the end of April 1942 Japan and its ally Thailand had almost conquered Burma Malaya the Dutch East Indies Singapore and Rabaul inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942 forcing its government into exile On 16 April in Burma 7000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea Java Sea and Indian Ocean and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin Australia In January 1942 the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha These easy victories over the unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident and overextended In early May 1942 Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force centred on two American fleet carriers fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea Japans next plan motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated as a diversion Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska In midMay Japan started the ZhejiangJiangxi campaign in China with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups In early June Japan put its operations into action but the Americans had broken Japanese naval codes in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle Japan attempted to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua The Americans planned a counterattack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands primarily Guadalcanal as a first step towards capturing Rabaul the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia Both plans started in July but by midSeptember the Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of BunaGona Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal By the start of 1943 the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops In Burma Commonwealth forces mounted two operations The first was a disastrous offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942 that forced a retreat back to India by May 1943 The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese frontlines in February which by the end of April had achieved mixed results Eastern Front 19421943 Despite considerable losses in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov and then in June 1942 launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy the Kuban steppe while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front The Germans split Army Group South into two groups Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck southeast to the Caucasus while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga By midNovember the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting The Soviets began their second winter counteroffensive starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow though the latter failed disastrously By early February 1943 the German Army had taken tremendous losses German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated and the frontline had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive In midFebruary after the Soviet push had tapered off the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk Western EuropeAtlantic and Mediterranean 19421943 Exploiting poor American naval command decisions the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast By November 1941 Commonwealth forces had launched a counteroffensive in North Africa Operation Crusader and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made The Germans also launched a North African offensive in January pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala line by early February followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives Concerns that the Japanese might use bases in Vichyheld Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942 An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein On the Continent raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets culminating in the failed Dieppe Raid demonstrated the Western Allies inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation equipment and operational security In August 1942 the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein and at a high cost managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta A few months later the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya This attack was followed up shortly after by AngloAmerican landings in French North Africa which resulted in the region joining the Allies Hitler responded to the French colonys defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943 In June 1943 the British and Americans began a strategic bombing campaign against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy reduce morale and dehouse the civilian population The firebombing of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre Allies gain momentum 19431944 After the Guadalcanal campaign the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific In May 1943 Canadian and US forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians Soon after the United States with support from Australia New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces began major ground sea and air operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands By the end of March 1944 the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands In April the Allies launched an operation to retake Western New Guinea In the Soviet Union both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia On 5 July 1943 Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge Within a week German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets wellconstructed defences and for the first time in the war Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which combined with previous Italian failures resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month On 12 July 1943 the Soviets launched their own counteroffensives thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified PantherWotan line but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and the Lower Dnieper Offensive On 3 September 1943 the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland following Italys armistice with the Allies and the ensuing German occupation of Italy Germany with the help of fascists responded to the armistice by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders seizing military control of Italian areas and creating a series of defensive lines German special forces then rescued Mussolini who then soon established a new client state in Germanoccupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic causing an Italian civil war The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in midNovember German operations in the Atlantic also suffered By May 1943 as Allied countermeasures became increasingly effective the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign In November 1943 Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kaishek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran The former conference determined the postwar return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma campaign while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germanys defeat From November 1943 during the sevenweek Battle of Changde the Chinese awaited allied relief as they forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition In January 1944 the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio On 27 January 1944 Soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled German forces from the Leningrad region thereby ending the most lethal siege in history The following Soviet offensive was halted on the prewar Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to reestablish national independence This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region By late May 1944 the Soviets had liberated Crimea largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine and made incursions into Romania which were repulsed by the Axis troops The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat Rome was captured on 4 June The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia In March 1944 the Japanese launched the first of two invasions an operation against Allied positions in Assam India and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima In May 1944 British and Indian forces mounted a counteroffensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy Chinas main fighting forces secure railways between Japaneseheld territory and capture Allied airfields By June the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha Allies close in 1944 On 6 June 1944 commonly known as DDay after three years of Soviet pressure the Western Allies invaded northern France After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy they also attacked southern France These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France Paris was liberated on 25 August by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces both led by General Charles de Gaulle and the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the latter part of the year An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed After that the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany but failed to cross the Ruhr river In Italy the Allied advance slowed due to the last major German defensive line On 22 June the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus Operation Bagration that nearly destroyed the German Army Group Centre Soon after that another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland The Soviets formed the Polish Committee of National Liberation to control territory in Poland and combat the Polish Armia Krajowa the Soviet Red Army remained in the Praga district on the other side of the Vistula and watched passively as the Germans quelled the Warsaw Uprising initiated by the Armia Krajowa The national uprising in Slovakia was also quelled by the Germans The Soviet Red Armys strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup dtat in Romania and in Bulgaria followed by those countries shift to the Allied side In September 1944 Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off By this point the communistled Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941 controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south In northern Serbia the Soviet Red Army with limited support from Bulgarian forces assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October A few days later the Soviets launched a massive assault against Germanoccupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945 Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a SovietFinnish armistice on relatively mild conditions although Finland was forced to fight their former German allies By the start of July 1944 Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River while the Chinese captured Myitkyina In September 1944 Chinese forces captured Mount Song and reopened the Burma Road In China the Japanese had more successes having finally captured Changsha in midJune and the city of Hengyang by early August Soon after they invaded the province of Guangxi winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the end of November and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by midDecember In the Pacific US forces continued to push back the Japanese perimeter In midJune 1944 they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands In late October American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte soon after Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf one of the largest naval battles in history Axis collapse and Allied victory 19441945 On 16 December 1944 Germany made a last attempt to split the Allies on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counteroffensive in the Ardennes and along the FrenchGerman border hoping to encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at Antwerp By 16 January 1945 this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled In Italy the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line In midJanuary 1945 the Red Army attacked in Poland pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany and overran East Prussia On 4 February Soviet British and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference They agreed on the occupation of postwar Germany and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan In February the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania while the Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river By March the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr encircling the German Army Group B In early March in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and retake Budapest Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake Balaton Within two weeks the offensive had been repulsed the Soviets advanced to Vienna and captured the city In early April Soviet troops captured Knigsberg while the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April leaving unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin Soviet troops stormed and captured Berlin in late April In Italy German forces surrendered on 29 April while the Italian Social Republic capitulated two days later On 30 April the Reichstag was captured signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany Major changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period On 12 April President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president Harry S Truman Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April On 30 April Hitler committed suicide in his headquarters and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dnitz as President of the Reich and Joseph Goebbels as Chancellor of the Reich Goebbels also committed suicide on the following day and was replaced by Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk in what would later be known as the Flensburg Government Total and unconditional surrender in Europe was signed on 7 and 8 May to be effective by the end of 8 May German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May On 23 May all remaining members of the German government were arrested by the Allied Forces in Flensburg while on 5 June all German political and military institutions were transferred under the control of the Allies through the Berlin Declaration In the Pacific theatre American forces accompanied by the forces of the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines clearing Leyte by the end of April 1945 They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and recaptured Manila in March Fighting continued on Luzon Mindanao and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war Meanwhile the United States Army Air Forces launched a massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry and civilian morale A devastating bombing raid on Tokyo of 910 March was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history In May 1945 Australian troops landed in Borneo overrunning the oilfields there British American and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May Chinese forces started a counterattack in the Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945 American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan taking Iwo Jima by March and Okinawa by the end of June At the same time a naval blockade by submarines was strangling Japans economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces On 11 July Allied leaders met in Potsdam Germany They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany and the American British and Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of Japan specifically stating that the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction During this conference the United Kingdom held its general election and Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime Minister The call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the Japanese government which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms In early August the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Between the two bombings the Soviets pursuant to the Yalta agreement declared war on Japan invaded Japaneseheld Manchuria and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army which was the largest Japanese fighting force These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms The Red Army also captured the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands On the night of 910 August 1945 Emperor Hirohito announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the Potsdam Declaration On 15 August the Emperor communicated this decision to the Japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio Gyokuonhs literally broadcast in the Emperors voice On 15 August 1945 Japan surrendered with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay on the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945 ending the war Aftermath The Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and Germany both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union respectively However their paths soon diverged In Germany the western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union officially ended in 1949 with the respective zones becoming separate countries West Germany and East Germany In Austria however occupation continued until 1955 when a joint settlement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union permitted the reunification of Austria as a democratic state officially nonaligned with any political bloc although in practice having better relations with the Western Allies A denazification program in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the Nuremberg trials and the removal of exNazis from power although this policy moved towards amnesty and reintegration of exNazis into West German society Germany lost a quarter of its prewar 1937 territory Among the eastern territories Silesia Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland and East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union followed by the expulsion to Germany of the nine million Germans from these provinces as well as three million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia By the 1950s onefifth of West Germans were refugees from the east The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon Line from which 2 million Poles were expelled northeast Romania parts of eastern Finland and the Baltic states were annexed into the Soviet Union Italy lost its monarchy colonial empire and some European territories In an effort to maintain world peace the Allies formed the United Nations which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations The great powers that were the victors of the warFrance China the United Kingdom the Soviet Union and the United Statesbecame the permanent members of the UNs Security Council The five permanent members remain so to the present although there have been two seat changes between the Republic of China and the Peoples Republic of China in 1971 and between the Soviet Union and its successor state the Russian Federation following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over Besides Germany the rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere which led to establishment of Communistled regimes with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities As a result East Germany Poland Hungary Romania Bulgaria Czechoslovakia and Albania became Soviet satellite states Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy causing tension with the Soviet Union A Communist uprising in Greece was put down with AngloAmerican support and the country remained aligned with the West Postwar division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances the United Statesled NATO and the Sovietled Warsaw Pact The long period of political tensions and military competition between themthe Cold Warwould be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world In Asia the United States led the occupation of Japan and administered Japans former islands in the Western Pacific while the Soviets annexed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands Korea formerly under Japanese colonial rule was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and 1948 Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948 each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea which led ultimately to the Korean War In China nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946 Communist forces were victorious and established the Peoples Republic of China on the mainland while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949 In the Middle East the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the ArabIsraeli conflict While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful leading to decolonisation The global economy suffered heavily from the war although participating nations were affected differently The United States emerged much richer than any other nation leading to a baby boom and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the world economy The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany from 1945 to 1948 Due to international trade interdependencies this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years At the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944 the Allied nations drew up an economic framework for the postwar world The agreement created the International Monetary Fund IMF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development IBRD which later became part of the World Bank Group The Bretton Woods system lasted until 1973 Recovery began with the mid1948 currency reform in Western Germany and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the US Marshall Plan economic aid 19481951 both directly and indirectly caused The post1948 West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded By contrast the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance more than any other European country it continued in relative economic decline for decades The Soviet Union despite enormous human and material losses also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate postwar era having seized and transferred most of Germanys industrial plants and exacted war reparations from its satellite states Japan recovered much later China returned to its prewar industrial production by 1952 Impact Casualties and war crimes Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary because many deaths went unrecorded Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians The Soviet Union alone lost around 27 million people during the war including 87 million military and 19 million civilian deaths A quarter of the total people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed Germany sustained 53 million military losses mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany An estimated 11 to 17 million civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of Hitlers racist policies including mass killing of around 6 million Jews along with Roma homosexuals at least 19 million ethnic Poles and millions of other Slavs including Russians Ukrainians and Belarusians and other ethnic and minority groups Between 1941 and 1945 more than 200000 ethnic Serbs along with Roma and Jews were persecuted and murdered by the Axisaligned Croatian Ustae in Yugoslavia Concurrently Muslims and Croats were persecuted and killed by Serb nationalist Chetniks with an estimated 5000068000 victims of which 41000 were civilians Also more than 100000 Poles were massacred by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the Volhynia massacres between 1943 and 1945 At the same time about 1000015000 Ukrainians were killed by the Polish Home Army and other Polish units in reprisal attacks In Asia and the Pacific the number of people killed by Japanese troops remains contested According to RJ Rummel the Japanese killed between 3 million and more than 10 million people with the most probable case of almost 6000000 people According to the British historian M R D Foot civilian deaths are between 10 million and 20 million whereas Chinese military casualties killed and wounded are estimated to be over five million Other estimates say that up to 30 million people most of them civilians were killed The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the Nanjing Massacre in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 27 million casualties occurred during the Three Alls policy General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Hebei and Shandong Axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons The Imperial Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China see Unit 731 and in early conflicts against the Soviets Both the Germans and the Japanese tested such weapons against civilians and sometimes on prisoners of war The Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22000 Polish officers and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD secret police along with mass civilian deportations to Siberia in the Baltic states and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories especially in Germany The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands and possibly as many as two million while figures for women raped by German soldiers in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million The mass bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a war crime although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during World War II The USAAF bombed a total of 67 Japanese cities killing 393000 civilians including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and destroying 65 of builtup areas Genocide concentration camps and slave labour Nazi Germany under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler was responsible for murdering about 6 million Jews in what is now known as the Holocaust They also murdered an additional 4 million others who were deemed unworthy of life including the disabled and mentally ill Soviet prisoners of war Romani homosexuals Freemasons and Jehovahs Witnesses as part of a program of deliberate extermination in effect becoming a genocidal state Soviet POWs were kept in especially unbearable conditions and 36 million Soviet POWs out of 57 million died in Nazi camps during the war In addition to concentration camps death camps were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale Nazi Germany extensively used forced labourers about 12 million Europeans from Germanoccupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry agriculture and war economy The Soviet Gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during 194243 when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates including foreign citizens of Poland and other countries occupied in 193940 by the Soviet Union as well as Axis POWs By the end of the war most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to NKVD evaluation and 226127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators Japanese prisonerofwar camps many of which were used as labour camps also had high death rates The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 percent for American POWs 37 percent seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians While 37583 prisoners from the UK 28500 from the Netherlands and 14473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan the number of Chinese released was only 56 At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board or Kain for work in mines and war industries After 1942 the number reached 10 million In Java between 4 and 10 million rmusha Japanese manual labourers were forced to work by the Japanese military About 270000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japaneseheld areas in Southeast Asia and only 52000 were repatriated to Java Occupation In Europe occupation came under two forms In Western Northern and Central Europe France Norway Denmark the Low Countries and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 695 billion reichsmarks 278 billion US dollars by the end of the war this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products military equipment raw materials and other goods Thus the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on In the East the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating frontlines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders Unlike in the West the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the inferior people of Slavic descent most German advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes The Nazis killed an estimated 277 million ethnic Poles during the war in addition to PolishJewish victims of the Holocaust Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East or the West until late 1943 In Asia Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia CoProsperity Sphere essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination Japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them During Japans initial conquest it captured 4000000 barrels 640000 m3 of oil 550000 tonnes left behind by retreating Allied forces and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels 7900000 m3 of oil 68 million tonnes 76 percent of its 1940 output rate Home fronts and production In the 1930s Britain and the United States of America together controlled almost 75 of world mineral outputessential for projecting military power In Europe before the outbreak of the war the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics In 1938 the Western Allies United Kingdom France Poland and the British Dominions had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers Germany and Italy including colonies the Allies had more than a 51 advantage in population and a nearly 21 advantage in GDP In Asia at the same time China had roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 percent higher GDP this reduces to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included The United States produced about twothirds of all munitions used by the Allies in World War II including warships transports warplanes artillery tanks trucks and ammunition Although the Allies economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan they became the decisive factor by 1942 after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of attrition While the Allies ability to outproduce the Axis was partly due to more access to natural resources other factors such as Germany and Japans reluctance to employ women in the labour force Allied strategic bombing and Germanys late shift to a war economy contributed significantly Additionally neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war and had not equipped themselves to do so To improve their production Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers Germany enslaved about 12 million people mostly from Eastern Europe while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia Advances in technology and its application Aircraft were used for reconnaissance as fighters bombers and groundsupport and each role developed considerably Innovations included airlift the capability to quickly move limited highpriority supplies equipment and personnel and strategic bombing the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemys ability to wage war Antiaircraft weaponry also advanced including defences such as radar and surfacetoair artillery in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war actions at Taranto Pearl Harbor and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship In the Atlantic escort carriers became a vital part of Allied convoys increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the MidAtlantic gap Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured Submarines which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War were expected by all combatants to be important in the second The British focused development on antisubmarine weaponry and tactics such as sonar and convoys while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics Gradually improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh Light Hedgehog Squid and homing torpedoes proved effective against German submarines Land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of World War I which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry to increased mobility and combined arms The tank which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War had evolved into the primary weapon In the late 1930s tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed armour and firepower At the start of the war most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour and German doctrine of avoiding tankversustank combat This along with Germanys use of combined arms were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France Many means of destroying tanks including indirect artillery antitank guns both towed and selfpropelled mines shortranged infantry antitank weapons and other tanks were used Even with largescale mechanisation infantry remained the backbone of all forces and throughout the war most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I The portable machine gun spread a notable example being the German MG 34 and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings The assault rifle a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines the most wellknown being the German Enigma machine Development of SIGINT signals intelligence and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra a pioneering method for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war Another component of military intelligence was deception which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as Mincemeat and Bodyguard Other technological and engineering feats achieved during or as a result of the war include the worlds first programmable computers Z3 Colossus and ENIAC guided missiles and modern rockets the Manhattan Projects development of nuclear weapons operations research the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel Penicillin was first developed massproduced and used during the war See also Opposition to World War II

    title: "French Revolution",
    originalContent:
      "The French Revolution French Rvolution franaise evlysj fsz was a period of political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the coup of 18 Brumaire in November 1799 and the formation of the French Consulate Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy while its values and institutions remain central to modern French political discourse The causes of the revolution were a combination of social political and economic factors which the ancien rgime old regime proved unable to manage A financial crisis and widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789 its first meeting since 1614 The representatives of the Third Estate broke away and reconstituted themselves as a National Assembly in June The Storming of the Bastille in Paris on 14 July was followed by a series of radical measures by the Assembly among them the abolition of feudalism state control over the Catholic Church and a declaration of rights The next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control and military defeats following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 led to an insurrection on 10 August The monarchy was replaced by the French First Republic in September and Louis XVI was executed in January 1793 After another revolt in June 1793 the constitution was suspended and adequate political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety led by the Jacobins About 16000 people were executed in what was later referred to as Reign of Terror which ended in July 1794 Weakened by external threats and internal opposition the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the Directory and four years later in 1799 the Consulate seized power in a military coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte on 9 November This event is generally seen as marking the end of the Revolutionary period Causes The Revolution resulted from multiple longterm and shortterm factors culminating in a social economic financial and political crisis in the late 1780s Combined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his ministers the result was a crisis the state was unable to manage Between 1715 and 1789 the French population grew from 21 to 28 million 20 of whom lived in towns or cities Paris alone having over 600000 inhabitants This was accompanied by a tripling in the size of the middle class which comprised almost 10 of the population by 1789 Despite increases in overall prosperity its benefits were largely restricted to the rentier and mercantile classes while the living standards fell for wage labourers and peasant farmers who rented their land Economic recession from 1785 combined with bad harvests in 1787 and 1788 led to high unemployment and food prices causing a financial and political crisis While the state also experienced a debt crisis the level of debt itself was not high compared with Britains A significant problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another were often different from the official amounts and collected inconsistently Its complexity meant uncertainty over the amount contributed by any authorised tax caused resentment among all taxpayers Attempts to simplify the system were blocked by the regional Parlements which approved financial policy The resulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates General of 1789 which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances Louis XVI was willing to consider reforms but often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely discussed among the educated French elite At the same time the American Revolution and the European revolts of the 1780s inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism liberty equality and democracy These shaped the response of the educated public to the crisis while scandals such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace fuelled widespread anger at the court nobility and church officials Crisis of the Ancien Rgime Financial and political crisis France faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure Although the economy grew solidly the increase was not reflected in a proportional growth in taxes their collection being contracted to tax farmers who kept much of it as personal profit As the nobility and Church benefited from many exemptions the tax burden fell mainly on peasants Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to be registered with regional judicial bodies or parlements that were able to block them The king could impose laws by decree but this risked open conflict with the parlements the nobility and those subject to new taxes France primarily funded the AngloFrench War of 17781783 through loans Following the peace the monarchy borrowed heavily culminating in a debt crisis By 1788 half of state revenue was required to service its debt In 1786 the French finance minister Calonne proposed a package of reforms including a universal land tax the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs and new provincial assemblies appointed by the king The new taxes however were rejected first by a handpicked Assembly of Notables dominated by the nobility then by the parlements when submitted by Calonnes successor Brienne The notables and parlements argued that the proposed taxes could only be approved by an EstatesGeneral a representative body that had last met in 1614 The conflict between the Crown and the parlements became a national political crisis Both sides issued a series of public statements the government arguing that it was combating privilege and the parlement defending the ancient rights of the nation Public opinion was firmly on the side of the parlements and riots broke out in several towns Briennes attempts to raise new loans failed and on 8 August 1788 he announced that the king would summon an EstatesGeneral to convene the following May Brienne resigned and was replaced by Necker In September 1788 the Parlement of Paris ruled that the EstatesGeneral should convene in the same form as in 1614 meaning that the three estates the clergy nobility and Third Estate or commons would meet and vote separately with votes counted by estate rather than by head As a result the clergy and nobility could combine to outvote the Third Estate despite representing less than 5 of the population Following the relaxation of censorship and laws against political clubs a group of liberal nobles and middle class activists known as the Society of Thirty launched a campaign for the doubling of Third Estate representation and individual voting The public debate saw an average of 25 new political pamphlets published a week from 25 September 1788 The Abb Sieys issued influential pamphlets denouncing the privilege of the clergy and nobility and arguing the Third Estate represented the nation and should sit alone as a National Assembly Activists such as Mounier Barnave and Robespierre organised regional meetings petitions and literature in support of these demands In December the king agreed to double the representation of the Third Estate but left the question of counting votes for the EstatesGeneral to decide EstatesGeneral of 1789 The EstatesGeneral contained three separate bodies the First Estate representing 100000 clergy the Second the nobility and the Third the commons Since each met separately and any proposals had to be approved by at least two the First and Second Estates could outvote the Third despite representing less than 5 of the population Although the Catholic Church in France owned nearly 10 of all land as well as receiving annual tithes paid by peasants threequarters of the 303 clergy elected were parish priests many of whom earned less than unskilled labourers and had more in common with their poor parishioners than with the bishops of the first estate The Second Estate elected 322 deputies representing about 400000 men and women who owned about 25 of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their tenants Most delegates were towndwelling members of the noblesse dpe or traditional aristocracy Courtiers and representatives of the noblesse de robe those who derived rank from judicial or administrative posts were underrepresented Of the 610 deputies of the Third Estate about twothirds held legal qualifications and almost half were venal office holders Less than 100 were in trade or industry and none were peasants or artisans To assist delegates each region completed a list of grievances known as Cahiers de dolances Tax inequality and seigneurial dues feudal payments owed to landowners headed the grievances in the cahiers de doleances for the estate On 5 May 1789 the EstatesGeneral convened at Versailles Necker outlined the state budget and reiterated the kings decision that each estate should decide on which matters it would agree to meet and vote in common with the other estates On the following day each estate was to separately verify the credentials of their representatives The Third Estate however voted to invite the other estates to join them in verifying all the representatives of the EstatesGeneral in common and to agree that votes should be counted by head Fruitless negotiations lasted to 12 June when the Third Estate began verifying its own members On 17 June the Third Estate declared itself to be the National Assembly of France and that all existing taxes were illegal Within two days more than 100 members of the clergy had joined them Shaken by this challenge to his authority the king agreed to a reform package that he would announce at a Royal Session of the EstatesGeneral The Salle des tats was closed to prepare for the joint session but the members of the EstatesGeneral were not informed in advance On 20 June when the members of the Third Estate found their meeting place closed they moved to a nearby tennis court and swore not to disperse until a new constitution had been agreed At the Royal Session the king announced a series of tax and other reforms and stated that no new taxes or loans would be implemented without the consent of the EstatesGeneral However he stated that the three estates were sacrosanct and it was up to each estate to agree to end their privileges and decide on which matters they would vote in common with the other estates At the end of the session the Third Estate refused to leave the hall and reiterated their oath not to disperse until a constitution had been agreed Over the next days more members of the clergy joined the National Assembly On 27 June faced with popular demonstrations and mutinies in his French Guards Louis XVI capitulated He commanded the members of the first and second estates to join the third in the National Assembly Constitutional monarchy July 1789 September 1792 Abolition of the Ancien Rgime Even the limited reforms the king had announced went too far for Marie Antoinette and Louis younger brother the Comte dArtois On their advice Louis dismissed Necker again as chief minister on 11 July On 12 July the Assembly went into a nonstop session after rumours circulated he was planning to use the Swiss Guards to force it to close The news brought crowds of protestors into the streets and soldiers of the elite Gardes Franaises regiment refused to disperse them On the 14th many of these soldiers joined the mob in attacking the Bastille a royal fortress with large stores of arms and ammunition Its governor BernardRen de Launay surrendered after several hours of fighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers Taken to the Htel de Ville he was executed his head placed on a pike and paraded around the city the fortress was then torn down in a remarkably short time Although rumoured to hold many prisoners the Bastille held only seven four forgers a lunatic a failed assassin and a deviant nobleman Nevertheless as a potent symbol of the Ancien Rgime its destruction was viewed as a triumph and Bastille Day is still celebrated every year In French culture some see its fall as the start of the Revolution Alarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital Louis appointed the Marquis de Lafayette commander of the National Guard with JeanSylvain Bailly as head of a new administrative structure known as the Commune On 17 July Louis visited Paris accompanied by 100 deputies where he was greeted by Bailly and accepted a tricolore cockade to loud cheers However it was clear power had shifted from his court he was welcomed as Louis XVI father of the French and king of a free people The shortlived unity enforced on the Assembly by a common threat quickly dissipated Deputies argued over constitutional forms while civil authority rapidly deteriorated On 22 July former Finance Minister Joseph Foullon and his son were lynched by a Parisian mob and neither Bailly nor Lafayette could prevent it In rural areas wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of militia and an agrarian insurrection known as la Grande Peur The breakdown of law and order and frequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad These migrs funded reactionary forces within France and urged foreign monarchs to back a counterrevolution In response the Assembly published the August Decrees which abolished feudalism Over 25 of French farmland was subject to feudal dues providing the nobility with most of their income these were now cancelled along with church tithes While their former tenants were supposed to pay them compensation collecting it proved impossible and the obligation was annulled in 1793 Other decrees included equality before the law opening public office to all freedom of worship and cancellation of special privileges held by provinces and towns With the suspension of the 13 regional parlements in November the key institutional pillars of the old regime had all been abolished in less than four months From its early stages the Revolution therefore displayed signs of its radical nature what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning intentions into practical applications Creating a new constitution On 9 July the National Assembly appointed a committee to draft a constitution and statement of rights Twenty drafts were submitted which were used by a subcommittee to create a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen with Mirabeau being the most prominent member The Declaration was approved by the Assembly and published on 26 August as a statement of principle The Assembly now concentrated on the constitution itself Mounier and his monarchist supporters advocated a bicameral system with an upper house appointed by the king who would also have the right to appoint ministers and veto legislation On 10 September the majority of the Assembly led by Sieys and Talleyrand voted in favour of a single body and the following day approved a suspensive veto for the king meaning Louis could delay implementation of a law but not block it indefinitely In October the Assembly voted to restrict political rights including voting rights to active citizens defined as French males over the age of 25 who paid direct taxes equal to three days labour The remainder were designated passive citizens restricted to civil rights a distinction opposed by a significant minority including the Jacobin clubs By mid1790 the main elements of a constitutional monarchy were in place although the constitution was not accepted by Louis until 1791 Food shortages and the worsening economy caused frustration at the lack of progress and led to popular unrest in Paris This came to a head in late September 1789 when the Flanders Regiment arrived in Versailles to reinforce the royal bodyguard and were welcomed with a formal banquet as was common practice The radical press described this as a gluttonous orgy and claimed the tricolour cockade had been abused while the Assembly viewed their arrival as an attempt to intimidate them On 5 October crowds of women assembled outside the Htel de Ville agitating against high food prices and shortages These protests quickly turned political and after seizing weapons stored at the Htel de Ville some 7000 of them marched on Versailles where they entered the Assembly to present their demands They were followed to Versailles by 15000 members of the National Guard under Lafayette who was virtually a prisoner of his own troops When the National Guard arrived later that evening Lafayette persuaded Louis the safety of his family required their relocation to Paris Next morning some of the protestors broke into the royal apartments searching for Marie Antoinette who escaped They ransacked the palace killing several guards Order was eventually restored and the royal family and Assembly left for Paris escorted by the National Guard Louis had announced his acceptance of the August Decrees and the Declaration and his official title changed from King of France to King of the French The Revolution and the Church Historian John McManners argues in eighteenthcentury France throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance their simultaneous collapse would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence One suggestion is that after a century of persecution some French Protestants actively supported an antiCatholic regime a resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire JeanJacques Rousseau considered a philosophical founder of the revolution wrote it was manifestly contrary to the law of nature that a handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Catholic Church to the state although the extent of religious belief has been questioned elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant by 1789 being French also meant being Catholic The church was the largest individual landowner in France controlling nearly 10 of all estates and levied tithes effectively a 10 tax on income collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops In return it provided a minimal level of social support The August decrees abolished tithes and on 2 November the Assembly confiscated all church property the value of which was used to back a new paper currency known as assignats In return the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor the sick and the orphaned On 13 February 1790 religious orders and monasteries were dissolved while monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life The Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 12 July 1790 made them employees of the state as well as establishing rates of pay and a system for electing priests and bishops Pope Pius VI and many French Catholics objected to this since it denied the authority of the Pope over the French Church In October thirty bishops wrote a declaration denouncing the law further fuelling opposition When clergy were required to swear loyalty to the Civil Constitution in November 1790 it split the church between the 24 who complied and the majority who refused This stiffened popular resistance against state interference especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as Normandy Brittany and the Vende where only a few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution The result was stateled persecution of Refractory clergy many of whom were forced into exile deported or executed Political divisions The period from October 1789 to spring 1791 is usually seen as one of relative tranquility when some of the most important legislative reforms were enacted However conflict over the source of legitimate authority was more apparent in the provinces where officers of the Ancien Rgime had been swept away but not yet replaced by new structures This was less obvious in Paris since the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe but disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly Centrists led by Sieys Lafayette Mirabeau and Bailly created a majority by forging consensus with monarchiens like Mounier and independents including Adrien Duport Barnave and Alexandre Lameth At one end of the political spectrum reactionaries like Cazals and Maury denounced the Revolution in all its forms with radicals like Maximilien Robespierre at the other He and JeanPaul Marat opposed the criteria for active citizens gaining them substantial support among the Parisian proletariat many of whom had been disenfranchised by the measure On 14 July 1790 celebrations were held throughout France commemorating the fall of the Bastille with participants swearing an oath of fidelity to the nation the law and the king The Fte de la Fdration in Paris was attended by the royal family with Talleyrand performing a mass Despite this show of unity the Assembly was increasingly divided while external players like the Paris Commune and National Guard competed for power One of the most significant was the Jacobin club originally a forum for general debate by August 1790 it had over 150 members split into different factions The Assembly continued to develop new institutions in September 1790 the regional Parlements were abolished and their legal functions replaced by a new independent judiciary with jury trials for criminal cases However moderate deputies were uneasy at popular demands for universal suffrage labour unions and cheap bread and over the winter of 1790 and 1791 they passed a series of measures intended to disarm popular radicalism These included exclusion of poorer citizens from the National Guard limits on use of petitions and posters and the June 1791 Le Chapelier Law suppressing trade guilds and any form of worker organisation The traditional force for preserving law and order was the army which was increasingly divided between officers who largely came from the nobility and ordinary soldiers In August 1790 the loyalist General Bouill suppressed a serious mutiny at Nancy although congratulated by the Assembly he was criticised by Jacobin radicals for the severity of his actions Growing disorder meant many professional officers either left or became migrs further destabilising the institution Varennes and after Held in the Tuileries Palace under virtual house arrest Louis XVI was urged by his brother and wife to reassert his independence by taking refuge with Bouill who was based at Montmdy with 10000 soldiers considered loyal to the Crown The royal family left the palace in disguise on the night of 20 June 1791 late the next day Louis was recognised as he passed through Varennes arrested and taken back to Paris The attempted escape had a profound impact on public opinion since it was clear Louis had been seeking refuge in Austria the Assembly now demanded oaths of loyalty to the regime and began preparing for war while fear of spies and traitors became pervasive Despite calls to replace the monarchy with a republic Louis retained his position but was generally regarded with acute suspicion and forced to swear allegiance to the constitution A new decree stated retracting this oath making war upon the nation or permitting anyone to do so in his name would be considered abdication However radicals led by Jacques Pierre Brissot prepared a petition demanding his deposition and on 17 July an immense crowd gathered in the Champ de Mars to sign Led by Lafayette the National Guard was ordered to preserve public order and responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd killing between 13 and 50 people The massacre badly damaged Lafayettes reputation the authorities responded by closing radical clubs and newspapers while their leaders went into exile or hiding including Marat On 27 August Emperor Leopold II and King Frederick William II of Prussia issued the Declaration of Pillnitz declaring their support for Louis and hinting at an invasion of France on his behalf In reality the meeting between Leopold and Frederick was primarily to discuss the Partitions of Poland the Declaration was intended to satisfy Comte dArtois and other French migrs but the threat rallied popular support behind the regime Based on a motion proposed by Robespierre existing deputies were barred from elections held in early September for the French Legislative Assembly Although Robespierre himself was one of those excluded his support in the clubs gave him a political power base not available to Lafayette and Bailly who resigned respectively as head of the National Guard and the Paris Commune The new laws were gathered together in the 1791 Constitution and submitted to Louis XVI who pledged to defend it from enemies at home and abroad On 30 September the Constituent Assembly was dissolved and the Legislative Assembly convened the next day Fall of the monarchy The Legislative Assembly is often dismissed by historians as an ineffective body compromised by divisions over the role of the monarchy an issue exacerbated when Louis attempted to prevent or reverse limitations on his powers At the same time restricting the vote to those who paid a minimal amount of tax disenfranchised a significant proportion of the 6 million Frenchmen over 25 while only 10 of those able to vote actually did so Finally poor harvests and rising food prices led to unrest among the urban class known as Sansculottes who saw the new regime as failing to meet their demands for bread and work This meant the new constitution was opposed by significant elements inside and outside the Assembly itself split into three main groups 264 members were affiliated with Barnaves Feuillants constitutional monarchists who considered the Revolution had gone far enough while another 136 were Jacobin leftists who supported a republic led by Brissot and usually referred to as Brissotins The remaining 345 belonged to La Plaine a centrist faction who switched votes depending on the issue but many of whom shared doubts as to whether Louis was committed to the Revolution After he officially accepted the new Constitution one recorded response was Vive le roi sil est de bon foi or Long live the king if he keeps his word Although a minority in the Assembly control of key committees allowed the Brissotins to provoke Louis into using his veto They first managed to pass decrees confiscating migr property and threatening them with the death penalty This was followed by measures against nonjuring priests whose opposition to the Civil Constitution led to a state of near civil war in southern France which Barnave tried to defuse by relaxing the more punitive provisions On 29 November the Assembly approved a decree giving refractory clergy eight days to comply or face charges of conspiracy against the nation an act opposed even by Robespierre When Louis vetoed both his opponents were able to portray him as opposed to reform in general Brissot accompanied this with a campaign for war against Austria and Prussia often interpreted as a mixture of calculation and idealism While exploiting popular antiAustrianism it reflected a genuine belief in exporting the values of political liberty and popular sovereignty Simultaneously conservatives headed by Marie Antoinette also favoured war seeing it as a way to regain control of the military and restore royal authority In December 1791 Louis made a speech in the Assembly giving foreign powers a month to disband the migrs or face war an act greeted with enthusiasm by supporters but suspicion from opponents Barnaves inability to build a consensus in the Assembly resulted in the appointment of a new government chiefly composed of Brissotins On 20 April 1792 the French Revolutionary Wars began when French armies attacked Austrian and Prussian forces along their borders before suffering a series of disastrous defeats In an effort to mobilise popular support the government ordered nonjuring priests to swear the oath or be deported dissolved the Constitutional Guard and replaced it with 20000 fdrs Louis agreed to disband the Guard but vetoed the other two proposals while Lafayette called on the Assembly to suppress the clubs Popular anger increased when details of the Brunswick Manifesto reached Paris on 1 August threatening unforgettable vengeance should any oppose the Allies in seeking to restore the power of the monarchy On the morning of 10 August a combined force of the Paris National Guard and provincial fdrs attacked the Tuileries Palace killing many of the Swiss Guards protecting it Louis and his family took refuge with the Assembly and shortly after 1100 am the deputies present voted to temporarily relieve the king effectively suspending the monarchy First Republic 17921795 Proclamation of the First Republic In late August elections were held for the National Convention New restrictions on the franchise meant the number of votes cast fell to 33 million versus 4 million in 1791 while intimidation was widespread The Brissotins now split between moderate Girondins led by Brissot and radical Montagnards headed by Robespierre Georges Danton and JeanPaul Marat While loyalties constantly shifted voting patterns suggest roughly 160 of the 749 deputies can generally be categorised as Girondists with another 200 Montagnards The remainder were part of a centrist faction known as La Plaine headed by Bertrand Barre Pierre Joseph Cambon and Lazare Carnot In the September Massacres between 1100 and 1600 prisoners held in Parisian jails were summarily executed the vast majority being common criminals A response to the capture of Longwy and Verdun by Prussia the perpetrators were largely National Guard members and fdrs on their way to the front While responsibility is still disputed even moderates expressed sympathy for the action which soon spread to the provinces One suggestion is that the killings stemmed from concern over growing lawlessness rather than political ideology On 20 September the French defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Valmy in what was the first major victory by the army of France during the Revolutionary Wars Emboldened by this on 22 September the Convention replaced the monarchy with the French First Republic 17921804 and introduced a new calendar with 1792 becoming Year One The next few months were taken up with the trial of Citoyen Louis Capet formerly Louis XVI While evenly divided on the question of his guilt members of the convention were increasingly influenced by radicals based within the Jacobin clubs and Paris Commune The Brunswick Manifesto made it easy to portray Louis as a threat to the Revolution especially when extracts from his personal correspondence showed him conspiring with Royalist exiles On 17 January 1793 Louis was sentenced to death for conspiracy against public liberty and general safety 361 deputies were in favour 288 against while another 72 voted to execute him subject to delaying conditions The sentence was carried out on 21 January on the Place de la Rvolution now the Place de la Concorde Conservatives across Europe now called for the destruction of revolutionary France and in February the Convention responded by declaring war on Britain and the Dutch Republic Together with Austria and Prussia these two countries were later joined by Spain Portugal Naples and Tuscany in the War of the First Coalition 17921797 Political crisis and fall of the Girondins The Girondins hoped war would unite the people behind the government and provide an excuse for rising prices and food shortages but found themselves the target of popular anger Many left for the provinces The first conscription measure or leve en masse on 24 February sparked riots in Paris and other regional centres Already unsettled by changes imposed on the church in March the traditionally conservative and royalist Vende rose in revolt On 18th Dumouriez was defeated at Neerwinden and defected to the Austrians Uprisings followed in Bordeaux Lyon Toulon Marseilles and Caen The Republic seemed on the verge of collapse The crisis led to the creation on 6 April 1793 of the Committee of Public Safety an executive committee accountable to the convention The Girondins made a fatal political error by indicting Marat before the Revolutionary Tribunal for allegedly directing the September massacres he was quickly acquitted further isolating the Girondins from the sansculottes When Jacques Hbert called for a popular revolt against the henchmen of Louis Capet on 24 May he was arrested by the Commission of Twelve a Girondindominated tribunal set up to expose plots In response to protests by the Commune the Commission warned if by your incessant rebellions something befalls the representatives of the nation Paris will be obliterated Growing discontent allowed the clubs to mobilise against the Girondins Backed by the Commune and elements of the National Guard on 31 May they attempted to seize power in a coup Although the coup failed on 2 June the convention was surrounded by a crowd of up to 80000 demanding cheap bread unemployment pay and political reforms including restriction of the vote to the sansculottes and the right to remove deputies at will Ten members of the commission and another twentynine members of the Girondin faction were arrested and on 10 June the Montagnards took over the Committee of Public Safety Meanwhile a committee led by Robespierres close ally SaintJust was tasked with preparing a new Constitution Completed in only eight days it was ratified by the convention on 24 June and contained radical reforms including universal male suffrage However normal legal processes were suspended following the assassination of Marat on 13 July by the Girondist Charlotte Corday which the Committee of Public Safety used as an excuse to take control The 1793 Constitution was suspended indefinitely in October Key areas of focus for the new government included creating a new state ideology economic regulation and winning the war They were helped by divisions among their internal opponents while areas like the Vende and Brittany wanted to restore the monarchy most supported the Republic but opposed the regime in Paris On 17 August the Convention voted a second leve en masse despite initial problems in equipping and supplying such large numbers by midOctober Republican forces had retaken Lyon Marseilles and Bordeaux while defeating Coalition armies at Hondschoote and Wattignies The new class of military leaders included a young colonel named Napoleon Bonaparte who was appointed commander of artillery at the siege of Toulon thanks to his friendship with Augustin Robespierre His success in that role resulted in promotion to the Army of Italy in April 1794 and the beginning of his rise to military and political power Reign of Terror Although intended to bolster revolutionary fervour the Reign of Terror rapidly degenerated into the settlement of personal grievances At the end of July the Convention set price controls on a wide range of goods with the death penalty for hoarders On 9 September revolutionary groups were established to enforce these controls while the Law of Suspects on 17th approved the arrest of suspected enemies of freedom This initiated what has become known as the Terror From September 1793 to July 1794 around 300000 were arrested with some 16600 people executed on charges of counterrevolutionary activity while another 40000 may have been summarily executed or died awaiting trial Price controls made farmers reluctant to sell their produce in Parisian markets and by early September the city was suffering acute food shortages At the same time the war increased public debt which the Assembly tried to finance by selling confiscated property However few would buy assets that might be repossessed by their former owners a concern that could only be achieved by military victory This meant the financial position worsened as threats to the Republic increased while printing assignats to deal with the deficit further increased inflation On 10 October the Convention recognised the Committee of Public Safety as the supreme Revolutionary Government and suspended the Constitution until peace was achieved In midOctober Marie Antoinette was convicted of a long list of crimes and guillotined two weeks later the Girondist leaders arrested in June were also executed along with Philippe galit The Terror was not confined to Paris with over 2000 killed in Lyons after its recapture At Cholet on 17 October the Republican army won a decisive victory over the Vende rebels and the survivors escaped into Brittany Another defeat at Le Mans on 23 December ended the rebellion as a major threat although the insurgency continued until 1796 The extent of the repression that followed has been debated by French historians since the mid19th century Between November 1793 to February 1794 over 4000 were drowned in the Loire at Nantes under the supervision of JeanBaptiste Carrier Historian Reynald Secher claims that as many as 117000 died between 1793 and 1796 Although those numbers have been challenged Franois Furet concluded it not only revealed massacre and destruction on an unprecedented scale but a zeal so violent that it has bestowed as its legacy much of the regions identity At the height of the Terror not even its supporters were immune from suspicion leading to divisions within the Montagnard faction between radical Hbertists and moderates led by Danton Robespierre saw their dispute as destabilising the regime and as a deist objected to the antireligious policies advocated by the atheist Hbert who was arrested and executed on 24 March with 19 of his colleagues including Carrier To retain the loyalty of the remaining Hbertists Danton was arrested and executed on 5 April with Camille Desmoulins after a show trial that arguably did more damage to Robespierre than any other act in this period The Law of 22 Prairial 10 June denied enemies of the people the right to defend themselves Those arrested in the provinces were now sent to Paris for judgement from March to July executions in Paris increased from five to twentysix a day Many Jacobins ridiculed the festival of the Cult of the Supreme Being on 8 June a lavish and expensive ceremony led by Robespierre who was also accused of circulating claims he was a second Messiah Relaxation of price controls and rampant inflation caused increasing unrest among the sansculottes but the improved military situation reduced fears the Republic was in danger Fearing their own survival depended on Robespierres removal on 29 June three members of the Committee of Public Safety openly accused him of being a dictator Robespierre responded by refusing to attend Committee meetings allowing his opponents to build a coalition against him In a speech made to the convention on 26 July he claimed certain members were conspiring against the Republic an almost certain death sentence if confirmed When he refused to provide names the session broke up in confusion That evening he repeated these claims at the Jacobins club where it was greeted with demands for execution of the traitors Fearing the consequences if they did not act first his opponents attacked Robespierre and his allies in the Convention next day When Robespierre attempted to speak his voice failed one deputy crying The blood of Danton chokes him After the Convention authorised his arrest he and his supporters took refuge in the Hotel de Ville which was defended by elements of the National Guard Other units loyal to the Convention stormed the building that evening and detained Robespierre who severely injured himself attempting suicide He was executed on 28 July with 19 colleagues including SaintJust and Georges Couthon followed by 83 members of the Commune The Law of 22 Prairial was repealed any surviving Girondists reinstated as deputies and the Jacobin Club was closed and banned There are various interpretations of the Terror and the violence with which it was conducted Franois Furet argues that the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries and their utopian goals required the extermination of any opposition A middle position suggests violence was not inevitable but the product of a series of complex internal events exacerbated by war Thermidorian reaction The bloodshed did not end with the death of Robespierre Southern France saw a wave of revenge killings directed against alleged Jacobins Republican officials and Protestants Although the victors of Thermidor asserted control over the Commune by executing their leaders some of those closely involved in the Terror retained their positions They included Paul Barras later chief executive of the French Directory and Joseph Fouch director of the killings in Lyon who served as Minister of Police under the Directory the Consulate and Empire Despite his links to Augustin Robespierre military success in Italy meant Napoleon Bonaparte escaped censure The December 1794 Treaty of La Jaunaye ended the Chouannerie in western France by allowing freedom of worship and the return of nonjuring priests This was accompanied by military success in January 1795 French forces helped the Dutch Patriots set up the Batavian Republic securing their northern border The war with Prussia was concluded in favour of France by the Peace of Basel in April 1795 while Spain made peace shortly thereafter However the Republic still faced a crisis at home Food shortages arising from a poor 1794 harvest were exacerbated in Northern France by the need to supply the army in Flanders while the winter was the worst since 1709 By April 1795 people were starving and the assignat was worth only 8 of its face value in desperation the Parisian poor rose again They were quickly dispersed and the main impact was another round of arrests while Jacobin prisoners in Lyon were summarily executed A committee drafted a new constitution approved by plebiscite on 23 September 1795 and put into place on 27th Largely designed by Pierre Daunou and Boissy dAnglas it established a bicameral legislature intended to slow down the legislative process ending the wild swings of policy under the previous unicameral systems The Council of 500 was responsible for drafting legislation which was reviewed and approved by the Council of Ancients an upper house containing 250 men over the age of 40 Executive power was in the hands of five Directors selected by the Council of Ancients from a list provided by the lower house with a fiveyear mandate Deputies were chosen by indirect election a total franchise of around 5 million voting in primaries for 30000 electors or 06 of the population Since they were also subject to stringent property qualification it guaranteed the return of conservative or moderate deputies In addition rather than dissolving the previous legislature as in 1791 and 1792 the socalled law of twothirds ruled only 150 new deputies would be elected each year The remaining 600 Conventionnels kept their seats a move intended to ensure stability The Directory 17951799 Jacobin sympathisers viewed the Directory as a betrayal of the Revolution while Bonapartists later justified Napoleons coup by emphasising its corruption The regime also faced internal unrest a weak economy and an expensive war while the Council of 500 could block legislation at will Since the Directors had no power to call new elections the only way to break a deadlock was rule by decree or use force As a result the Directory was characterised by chronic violence ambivalent forms of justice and repeated recourse to heavyhanded repression Retention of the Conventionnels ensured the Thermidorians held a majority in the legislature and three of the five Directors but they were increasingly challenged by the right On 5 October Convention troops led by Napoleon put down a royalist rising in Paris when the first elections were held two weeks later over 100 of the 150 new deputies were royalists of some sort The power of the Parisian sansculottes had been broken by the suppression of the May 1795 revolt relieved of pressure from below the Jacobin clubs became supporters of the Directory largely to prevent restoration of the monarchy Removal of price controls and a collapse in the value of the assignat led to inflation and soaring food prices By April 1796 over 500000 Parisians were unemployed resulting in the May insurrection known as the Conspiracy of the Equals Led by the revolutionary FranoisNol Babeuf their demands included immediate implementation of the 1793 Constitution and a more equitable distribution of wealth Despite support from sections of the military the revolt was easily crushed while Babeuf and other leaders were executed Nevertheless by 1799 the economy had been stabilised and important reforms made allowing steady expansion of French industry Many of these remained in place for much of the 19th century Prior to 1797 three of the five Directors were firmly Republican Barras RvellireLpeaux and JeanFranois Rewbell as were around 40 of the legislature The same percentage were broadly centrist or unaffiliated along with two Directors tienneFranois Letourneur and Lazare Carnot Although only 20 were committed Royalists many centrists supported the restoration of the exiled Louis XVIII of France in the belief this would bring peace The elections of May 1797 resulted in significant gains for the right with Royalists JeanCharles Pichegru elected President of the Council of 500 and Barthlemy appointed a Director With Royalists apparently on the verge of power Republicans attempted a preemptive coup on 4 September Using troops from Napoleons Army of Italy under Pierre Augereau the Council of 500 was forced to approve the arrest of Barthlemy Pichegru and Carnot The elections were annulled sixtythree leading Royalists deported to French Guiana and new laws passed against migrs Royalists and ultraJacobins The removal of his conservative opponents opened the way for direct conflict between Barras and those on the left Fighting continued despite general war weariness and the 1798 elections saw a resurgence in Jacobin strength Napoleons invasion of Egypt in July 1798 confirmed European fears of French expansionism and the War of the Second Coalition began in November Without a majority in the legislature the Directors relied on the army to enforce decrees and extract revenue from conquered territories Generals like Napoleon and Joubert were now central to the political process while both the army and Directory became notorious for their corruption It has been suggested the Directory collapsed because by 1799 many preferred the uncertainties of authoritarian rule to the continuing ambiguities of parliamentary politics The architect of its end was Sieys who when asked what he had done during the Terror allegedly answered I survived Nominated to the Directory his first action was to remove Barras with the help of allies including Talleyrand and Napoleons brother Lucien President of the Council of 500 On 9 November 1799 the Coup of 18 Brumaire replaced the five Directors with the French Consulate which consisted of three members Napoleon Sieys and Roger Ducos Most historians consider this the end point of the French Revolution Role of ideology The role of ideology in the Revolution is controversial with Jonathan Israel stating that the radical Enlightenment was the primary driving force of the Revolution Cobban however argues the actions of the revolutionaries were most often prescribed by the need to find practical solutions to immediate problems using the resources at hand not by preconceived theories The identification of ideologies is complicated by the profusion of revolutionary clubs factions and publications absence of formal political parties and individual flexibility in the face of changing circumstances In addition although the Declaration of the Rights of Man was a fundamental document for all revolutionary factions its interpretation varied widely While all revolutionaries professed their devotion to liberty in principle it appeared to mean whatever those in power wanted For example the liberties specified in the Rights of Man were limited by law when they might cause harm to others or be abused Prior to 1792 Jacobins and others frequently opposed press restrictions on the grounds these violated a basic right However the radical National Convention passed laws in September 1793 and July 1794 imposing the death penalty for offences such as disparaging the National Convention and misleading public opinion While revolutionaries also endorsed the principle of equality few advocated equality of wealth since property was also viewed as a right The National Assembly opposed equal political rights for women while the abolition of slavery in the colonies was delayed until February 1794 because it conflicted with the property rights of slave owners and many feared it would disrupt trade Political equality for male citizens was another divisive issue with the 1791 constitution limiting the right to vote and stand for office to males over 25 who met a property qualification socalled active citizens This restriction was opposed by many activists including Robespierre the Jacobins and Cordeliers The principle that sovereignty resided in the nation was a key concept of the Revolution However Israel argues this obscures ideological differences over whether the will of the nation was best expressed through representative assemblies and constitutions or direct action by revolutionary crowds and popular assemblies such as the sections of the Paris commune Many considered constitutional monarchy as incompatible with the principle of popular sovereignty but prior to 1792 there was a strong bloc with an ideological commitment to such a system based on the writings of Hobbes Locke Montesquieu and Voltaire Israel argues the nationalisation of church property and the establishment of the Constitutional Church reflected an ideological commitment to secularism and a determination to undermine a bastion of old regime privilege While Cobban agrees the Constitutional Church was motivated by ideology he sees its origins in the anticlericalism of Voltaire and other Enlightenment figures Jacobins were hostile to formal political parties and factions which they saw as a threat to national unity and the general will with political virtue and love of country key elements of their ideology They viewed the ideal revolutionary as selfless sincere free of political ambition and devoted to the nation The disputes leading to the departure first of the Feuillants then later the Girondists were conducted in terms of the relative political virtue and patriotism of the disputants In December 1793 all members of the Jacobin clubs were subject to a purifying scrutiny to determine whether they were men of virtue French Revolutionary Wars The Revolution initiated a series of conflicts that began in 1792 and ended only with Napoleons defeat at Waterloo in 1815 In its early stages this seemed unlikely the 1791 Constitution specifically disavowed war for the purpose of conquest and although traditional tensions between France and Austria reemerged in the 1780s Emperor Joseph II cautiously welcomed the reforms Austria was at war with the Ottomans as were the Russians while both were negotiating with Prussia over partitioning Poland Most importantly Britain preferred peace and as Emperor Leopold II stated after the Declaration of Pillnitz without England there is no case In late 1791 factions within the Assembly came to see war as a way to unite the country and secure the Revolution by eliminating hostile forces on its borders and establishing its natural frontiers France declared war on Austria in April 1792 and issued the first conscription orders with recruits serving for twelve months By the time peace finally came in 1815 the conflict had involved every major European power as well as the United States redrawn the map of Europe and expanded into the Americas the Middle East and the Indian Ocean From 1701 to 1801 the population of Europe grew from 118 to 187 million combined with new mass production techniques this allowed belligerents to support large armies requiring the mobilisation of national resources It was a different kind of war fought by nations rather than kings intended to destroy their opponents ability to resist but also to implement deepranging social change While all wars are political to some degree this period was remarkable for the emphasis placed on reshaping boundaries and the creation of entirely new European states In April 1792 French armies invaded the Austrian Netherlands but suffered a series of setbacks before victory over an AustrianPrussian army at Valmy in September After defeating a second Austrian army at Jemappes on 6 November they occupied the Netherlands areas of the Rhineland Nice and Savoy Emboldened by this success in February 1793 France declared war on the Dutch Republic Spain and Britain beginning the War of the First Coalition However the expiration of the 12month term for the 1792 recruits forced the French to relinquish their conquests In August new conscription measures were passed and by May 1794 the French army had between 750000 and 800000 men Despite high rates of desertion this was large enough to manage multiple internal and external threats for comparison the combined PrussianAustrian army was less than 90000 By February 1795 France had annexed the Austrian Netherlands established their frontier on the left bank of the Rhine and replaced the Dutch Republic with the Batavian Republic a satellite state These victories led to the collapse of the antiFrench coalition Prussia made peace in April 1795 followed soon after by Spain leaving Britain and Austria as the only major powers still in the war In October 1797 a series of defeats by Bonaparte in Italy led Austria to agree to the Treaty of Campo Formio in which they formally ceded the Netherlands and recognised the Cisalpine Republic Fighting continued for two reasons first French state finances had come to rely on indemnities levied on their defeated opponents Second armies were primarily loyal to their generals for whom the wealth achieved by victory and the status it conferred became objectives in themselves Leading soldiers like Hoche Pichegru and Carnot wielded significant political influence and often set policy Campo Formio was approved by Bonaparte not the Directory which strongly objected to terms it considered too lenient Despite these concerns the Directory never developed a realistic peace programme fearing the destabilising effects of peace and the consequent demobilisation of hundreds of thousands of young men As long as the generals and their armies stayed away from Paris they were happy to allow them to continue fighting a key factor behind sanctioning Bonapartes invasion of Egypt This resulted in aggressive and opportunistic policies leading to the War of the Second Coalition in November 1798 Slavery and the colonies In 1789 the most populous French colonies were SaintDomingue today Haiti Martinique Guadeloupe the le Bourbon Runion and the le de la France These colonies produced commodities such as sugar coffee and cotton for exclusive export to France There were about 700000 slaves in the colonies of which about 500000 were in SaintDomingue Colonial products accounted for about a third of Frances exports In February 1788 the Socit des Amis des Noirs Society of the Friends of Blacks was formed in France with the aim of abolishing slavery in the empire In August 1789 colonial slave owners and merchants formed the rival Club de Massiac to represent their interests When the Constituent Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August 1789 delegates representing the colonial landowners successfully argued that the principles should not apply in the colonies as they would bring economic ruin and disrupt trade Colonial landowners also gained control of the Colonial Committee of the Assembly from where they exerted a powerful influence against abolition People of colour also faced social and legal discrimination in mainland France and its colonies including a bar on their access to professions such as law medicine and pharmacy In 178990 a delegation of free coloureds led by Vincent Og and Julien Raimond unsuccessfully lobbied the Assembly to end discrimination against free coloureds Og left for SaintDomingue where an uprising against white landowners broke out in October 1790 The revolt failed and Og was killed In May 1791 the National Assembly granted full political rights to coloureds born of two free parents but left the rights of freed slaves to be determined by the colonial assemblies The assemblies refused to implement the decree and fighting broke out between the coloured population of SaintDomingue and white colonists each side recruiting slaves to their forces A major slave revolt followed in August In March 1792 the Legislative Assembly responded to the revolt by granting citizenship to all free coloureds and sending two commissioners Sonthonax and Polvrel and 6000 troops to SaintDomingue to enforce the decree On arrival in September the commissioners announced that slavery would remain in force Over 72000 slaves were still in revolt mostly in the north Brissot and his supporters envisaged an eventual abolition of slavery but their immediate concern was securing trade and the support of merchants for the revolutionary wars After Brissots fall the new constitution of June 1793 included a new Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen but excluded the colonies from its provisions In any event the new constitution was suspended until France was at peace In early 1793 royalist planters from Guadeloupe and SaintDomingue formed an alliance with Britain The Spanish supported insurgent slaves led by JeanFranois Papillon and Georges Biassou in the north of SaintDomingue White planters loyal to the republic sent representatives to Paris to convince the Jacobin controlled Convention that those calling for the abolition of slavery were British agents and supporters of Brissot hoping to disrupt trade In June the commissioners in SaintDomingue freed 10000 slaves fighting for the republic As the royalists and their British and Spanish supporters were also offering freedom for slaves willing to fight for their cause the commissioners outbid them by abolishing slavery in the north in August and throughout the colony in October Representatives were sent to Paris to gain the approval of the convention for the decision The Convention voted for the abolition of slavery in the colonies on 4 February 1794 and decreed that all residents of the colonies had the full rights of French citizens irrespective of colour An army of 1000 sansculottes led by Victor Hugues was sent to Guadeloupe to expel the British and enforce the decree The army recruited former slaves and eventually numbered 11000 capturing Guadeloupe and other smaller islands Abolition was also proclaimed on Guyane Martinique remained under British occupation while colonial landowners in Runion and the les Mascareignes repulsed the republicans Black armies drove the Spanish out of SaintDomingue in 1795 and the last of the British withdrew in 1798 In republican controlled areas from 1793 to 1799 freed slaves were required to work on their former plantations or for their former masters if they were in domestic service They were paid a wage and gained property rights Black and coloured generals were effectively in control of large areas of Guadeloupe and SaintDomingue including Toussaint Louverture in the north of SaintDomingue and Andr Rigaud in the south Historian Frderic Rgent states that the restrictions on the freedom of employment and movement of former slaves meant that only whites persons of color already freed before the decree and former slaves in the army or on warships really benefited from general emancipation Media and symbolism Newspapers Newspapers and pamphlets played a central role in stimulating and defining the Revolution Prior to 1789 there have been a small number of heavily censored newspapers that needed a royal licence to operate but the EstatesGeneral created an enormous demand for news and over 130 newspapers appeared by the end of the year Among the most significant were Marats LAmi du peuple and Elyse Loustallots Revolutions de Paris Over the next decade more than 2000 newspapers were founded 500 in Paris alone Most lasted only a matter of weeks but they became the main communication medium combined with the very large pamphlet literature Newspapers were read aloud in taverns and clubs and circulated hand to hand There was a widespread assumption that writing was a vocation not a business and the role of the press was the advancement of civic republicanism By 1793 the radicals were most active but initially the royalists flooded the country with their publication the LAmi du Roi Friends of the King until they were suppressed Revolutionary symbols To illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbols To this end symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic La Marseillaise La Marseillaise French pronunciation la masjz became the national anthem of France The song was written and composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle and was originally titled Chant de guerre pour lArme du Rhin The French National Convention adopted it as the First Republics anthem in 1795 It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille marching on the capital The song is the first example of the European march anthemic style while the evocative melody and lyrics led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music De Lisle was instructed to produce a hymn which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it the music suggests Guillotine The guillotine remains the principal symbol of the Terror in the French Revolution Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker more efficient and more distinctive form of execution the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory It was celebrated on the left as the peoples avenger for example in the revolutionary song La guillotine permanente and cursed as the symbol of the Terror by the right Its operation became a popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators Vendors sold programmes listing the names of those scheduled to die Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings knitting women tricoteuses formed a cadre of hardcore regulars inciting the crowd Parents often brought their children By the end of the Terror the crowds had thinned drastically Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments and audiences grew bored Cockade tricolore and liberty cap Cockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789 They now pinned the blueandred cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the Ancien Rgime Camille Desmoulins asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789 The Paris militia formed on 13 July adopted a blue and red cockade Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris and they are used on the citys coat of arms Cockades with various colour schemes were used during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July The Liberty cap also known as the Phrygian cap or pileus is a brimless felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward It reflects Roman republicanism and liberty alluding to the Roman ritual of manumission in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty Role of women Deprived of political rights by the Ancien Rgime the Revolution initially allowed women to participate although only to a limited degree Activists included Girondists like Olympe de Gouges author of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen and Charlotte Corday killer of Marat Others like Throigne de Mricourt Pauline Lon and the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women supported the Jacobins staged demonstrations in the National Assembly and took part in the October 1789 March to Versailles Despite this the 1791 and 1793 constitutions denied them political rights and democratic citizenship In 1793 the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women campaigned for strict price controls on bread and a law that would compel all women to wear the tricolour cockade Although both demands were successful in October the maledominated Jacobins who then controlled the government denounced the Society as dangerous rabblerousers and made all womens clubs and associations illegal Organised women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after 30 October 1793 At the same time especially in the provinces women played a prominent role in resisting social changes introduced by the Revolution This was particularly so in terms of the reduced role of the Catholic Church for those living in rural areas closing of the churches meant a loss of normality This sparked a counterrevolutionary movement led by women while supporting other political and social changes they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and revolutionary cults like the Cult of the Supreme Being Olwen Hufton argues some wanted to protect the Church from heretical changes enforced by revolutionaries viewing themselves as defenders of faith Prominent women Olympe de Gouges was an author whose publications emphasised that while women and men were different this should not prevent equality under the law In her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen she insisted women deserved rights especially in areas concerning them directly such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children Along with other Girondists she was executed in November 1793 during the Terror Madame Roland also known as Manon or Marie Roland was another important female activist whose political focus was not specifically women but other aspects of the government A Girondist her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy in addition she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins a political group which allowed women to join She too was executed in November 1793 Economic policies The Revolution abolished many economic constraints imposed by the Ancien Rgime including church tithes and feudal dues although tenants often paid higher rents and taxes All church lands were nationalised along with those owned by Royalist exiles which were used to back paper currency known as assignats and the feudal guild system eliminated It also abolished the highly inefficient system of tax farming whereby private individuals would collect taxes for a hefty fee The government seized the foundations that had been set up starting in the 13th century to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals poor relief and education The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nations charitable and school systems were massively disrupted Between 1790 and 1796 industrial and agricultural output dropped foreign trade plunged and prices soared forcing the government to finance expenditure by issuing ever increasing quantities assignats When this resulted in escalating inflation the response was to impose price controls and persecute private speculators and traders creating a black market Between 1789 and 1793 the annual deficit increased from 10 to 64 of gross national product while annual inflation reached 3500 after a poor harvest in 1794 and the removal of price controls The assignats were withdrawn in 1796 but inflation continued until the introduction of the goldbased Franc germinal in 1803 Impact The French Revolution had a major impact on western history by ending feudalism in France and creating a path for advances in individual freedoms throughout Europe The revolution represented the most significant challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world Its impact on French nationalism was profound while also stimulating nationalist movements throughout Europe Some modern historians argue the concept of the nation state was a direct consequence of the revolution As such the revolution is often seen as marking the start of modernity and the modern period France The longterm impact on France was profound shaping politics society religion and ideas and polarising politics for more than a century Historian Franois Aulard wroteFrom the social point of view the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system in the emancipation of the individual in greater division of landed property the abolition of the privileges of noble birth the establishment of equality the simplification of life The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national for it aimed at benefiting all humanityThe revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church although the two institutions survived Hanson suggests the French underwent a fundamental transformation in selfidentity evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by intrinsic human rights After the collapse of the First French Empire in 1815 the French public lost many of the rights and privileges earned since the revolution but remembered the participatory politics that characterised the period According to Paul Hanson Revolution became a tradition and republicanism an enduring option The Revolution meant an end to arbitrary royal rule and held out the promise of rule by law under a constitutional order Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system and the restored Bourbons were forced to retain one After the abdication of Napoleon III in 1871 the French Third Republic was launched with a deep commitment to upholding the ideals of the Revolution The Vichy regime 19401944 tried to undo the revolutionary heritage but retained the republic However there were no efforts by the Bourbons Vichy or any other government to restore the privileges that had been stripped away from the nobility in 1789 France permanently became a society of equals under the law Agriculture was transformed by the Revolution With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands rural France became more a land of small independent farms Harvest taxes were ended such as the tithe and seigneurial dues Primogeniture was ended both for nobles and peasants thereby weakening the family patriarch and led to a fall in the birth rate since all children had a share in the family property Cobban argues the Revolution bequeathed to the nation a ruling class of landowners Economic historians are divided on the economic impact of the Revolution One suggestion is the resulting fragmentation of agricultural holdings had a significant negative impact in the early years of 19th century then became positive in the second half of the century because it facilitated the rise in human capital investments Others argue the redistribution of land had an immediate positive impact on agricultural productivity before the scale of these gains gradually declined over the course of the 19th century In the cities entrepreneurship on a small scale flourished as restrictive monopolies privileges barriers rules taxes and guilds gave way However the British blockade virtually ended overseas and colonial trade hurting the cities and their supply chains Overall the Revolution did not greatly change the French business system and probably helped freeze in place the horizons of the small business owner The typical businessman owned a small store mill or shop with family help and a few paid employees largescale industry was less common than in other industrialising nations Europe outside France Historians often see the impact of the Revolution as through the institutions and ideas exported by Napoleon Economic historians Dan Bogart Mauricio Drelichman Oscar Gelderblom and JeanLaurent Rosenthal describe Napoleons codified law as the French Revolutions most significant export According to Daron Acemoglu Davide Cantoni Simon Johnson and James A Robinson the French Revolution had longterm effects in Europe They suggest that areas that were occupied by the French and that underwent radical institutional reform experienced more rapid urbanization and economic growth especially after 1850 There is no evidence of a negative effect of French invasion The Revolution sparked intense debate in Britain The Revolution Controversy was a pamphlet war set off by the publication of A Discourse on the Love of Our Country a speech given by Richard Price to the Revolution Society on 4 November 1789 supporting the French Revolution Edmund Burke responded in November 1790 with his own pamphlet Reflections on the Revolution in France attacking the French Revolution as a threat to the aristocracy of all countries William Coxe opposed Prices premise that ones country is principles and people not the State itself Conversely two seminal political pieces of political history were written in Prices favour supporting the general right of the French people to replace their State One of the first of these pamphlets into print was A Vindication of the Rights of Men by Mary Wollstonecraft Wollstonecrafts title was echoed by Thomas Paines Rights of Man published a few months later In 1792 Christopher Wyvill published Defence of Dr Price and the Reformers of England a plea for reform and moderation This exchange of ideas has been described as one of the great political debates in British history In Ireland the effect was to transform what had been an attempt by Protestant settlers to gain some autonomy into a mass movement led by the Society of United Irishmen involving Catholics and Protestants It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland especially in Ulster The upshot was a revolt in 1798 led by Wolfe Tone that was crushed by Britain German reaction to the Revolution swung from favourable to antagonistic At first it brought liberal and democratic ideas the end of guilds serfdom and the Jewish ghetto It brought economic freedoms and agrarian and legal reform Above all the antagonism helped stimulate and shape German nationalism France invaded Switzerland and turned it into the Helvetic Republic 17981803 a French puppet state French interference with localism and traditions was deeply resented in Switzerland although some reforms took hold and survived in the later period of restoration During the Revolutionary Wars the French invaded and occupied the region now known as Belgium between 1794 and 1814 The new government enforced reforms incorporating the region into France Resistance was strong in every sector as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule The French legal system however was adopted with its equal legal rights and abolition of class distinctions The Kingdom of Denmark adopted liberalising reforms in line with those of the French Revolution Reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders Much of the initiative came from wellorganised liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century The Constitution of Norway of 1814 was inspired by the French Revolution and was considered to be one of the most liberal and democratic constitutions at the time North America Initially most people in the Province of Quebec were favourable toward the revolutionaries aims The Revolution took place against the background of an ongoing campaign for constitutional reform in the colony by Loyalist emigrants from the United States Public opinion began to shift against the Revolution after the Flight to Varennes and further soured after the September Massacres and the subsequent execution of Louis XVI French migration to the Canadas experienced a substantial decline during and after the Revolution Only a limited number of artisans professionals and religious emigres were allowed to settle in the region during this period Most emigres settled in Montreal or Quebec City The influx of religious emigres also revitalised the local Catholic Church with exiled priests establishing a number of parishes across the Canadas In the United States the French Revolution deeply polarised American politics and this polarisation led to the creation of the First Party System In 1793 as war broke out in Europe the DemocraticRepublican Party led by former American minister to France Thomas Jefferson favored revolutionary France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect George Washington and his unanimous cabinet including Jefferson decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war Washington proclaimed neutrality instead Historiography The first writings on the French revolution were near contemporaneous with events and mainly divided along ideological lines These included Edmund Burkes conservative critique Reflections on the Revolution in France 1790 and Thomas Paines response Rights of Man 1791 From 1815 narrative histories dominated often based on firsthand experience of the revolutionary years By the midnineteenth century more scholarly histories appeared written by specialists and based on original documents and a more critical assessment of contemporary accounts Dupuy identifies three main strands in nineteenth century historiography of the Revolution The first is represented by reactionary writers who rejected the revolutionary ideals of popular sovereignty civil equality and the promotion of rationality progress and personal happiness over religious faith The second stream is those writers who celebrated its democratic and republican values The third were liberals like Germaine de Stal and Guizot who accepted the necessity of reforms establishing a constitution and the rights of man but rejected state interference with private property and individual rights even when supported by a democratic majority Jules Michelet was a leading 19thcentury historian of the democratic republican strand and Thiers Mignet and Tocqueville were prominent in the liberal strand Hippolyte Taines Origins of Contemporary France 18751894 was modern in its use of departmental archives but Dupuy sees him as reactionary given his contempt for the crowd and Revolutionary values The broad distinction between conservative democraticrepublican and liberal interpretations of the Revolution persisted in the 20thcentury although historiography became more nuanced with greater attention to critical analysis of documentary evidence Alphonse Aulard 18491928 was the first professional historian of the Revolution he promoted graduate studies scholarly editions and learned journals His major work The French Revolution a Political History 17891804 1905 was a democratic and republican interpretation of the Revolution Socioeconomic analysis and a focus on the experiences of ordinary people dominated French studies of the Revolution from the 1930s Georges Lefebvre elaborated a Marxist socioeconomic analysis of the revolution with detailed studies of peasants the rural panic of 1789 and the behaviour of revolutionary crowds Albert Soboul also writing in the MarxistRepublican tradition published a major study of the sansculottes in 1958 Alfred Cobban challenged JacobinMarxist social and economic explanations of the revolution in two important works The Myth of the French Revolution 1955 and Social Interpretation of the French Revolution 1964 He argued the Revolution was primarily a political conflict which ended in a victory for conservative property owners a result which retarded economic development In their 1965 work La Revolution franaise Franois Furet and Denis Richet also argued for the primacy of political decisions contrasting the reformist period of 1789 to 1790 with the following interventions of the urban masses which led to radicalisation and an ungovernable situation From the 1990s Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations of the revolution in terms of bourgeoisieproletarian class struggle as anachronistic However no new explanatory model has gained widespread support The historiography of the Revolution has expanded into areas such as cultural and regional histories visual representations

    title: "Roman Empire",
    originalContent:
      "The Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean and much of Europe Western Asia and North Africa The Romans conquered most of this during the Republic and it was ruled by emperors following Octavians assumption of effective sole rule in 27 BC The western empire collapsed in 476 AD but the eastern empire lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 By 100 BC the city of Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond However it was severely destabilised by civil wars and political conflicts which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt In 27 BC the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power imperium and the new title of Augustus marking his accession as the first Roman emperor The vast Roman territories were organized into senatorial provinces governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually and imperial provinces which belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana lit Roman Peace Rome reached its greatest territorial extent under Trajan r 98117 AD but a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus r 180192 In the 3rd century the Empire underwent a 49year crisis that threatened its existence due to civil war plagues and barbarian invasions The Gallic and Palmyrene empires broke away from the state and a series of shortlived emperors led the Empire which was later reunified under Aurelian r 270275 The civil wars ended with the victory of Diocletian r 284305 who set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West Constantine the Great r 306337 the first Christian emperor moved the imperial seat from Rome to Byzantium in 330 and renamed it Constantinople The Migration Period involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 by Odoacer the Western Empire finally collapsed The Eastern Roman Empire survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital until the citys fall in 1453 Due to the Empires extent and endurance its institutions and culture had a lasting influence on the development of language religion art architecture literature philosophy law and forms of government across its territories Latin evolved into the Romance languages while Medieval Greek became the language of the East The Empires adoption of Christianity resulted in the formation of medieval Christendom Roman and Greek art had a profound impact on the Italian Renaissance Romes architectural tradition served as the basis for Romanesque Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture influencing Islamic architecture The rediscovery of classical science and technology which formed the basis for Islamic science in medieval Europe contributed to the Scientific Renaissance and Scientific Revolution Many modern legal systems such as the Napoleonic Code descend from Roman law Romes republican institutions have influenced the Italian citystate republics of the medieval period the early United States and modern democratic republics History Transition from Republic to Empire Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC though not outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC Thus it was an empire a great power long before it had an emperor The Republic was not a nationstate in the modern sense but a network of selfruled towns with varying degrees of independence from the Senate and provinces administered by military commanders It was governed by annually elected magistrates Roman consuls above all in conjunction with the Senate The 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval which ultimately led to rule by emperors The consuls military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium meaning command typically in a military sense Occasionally successful consuls or generals were given the honorary title imperator commander this is the origin of the word emperor since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts conspiracies and civil wars from the late second century BC see Crisis of the Roman Republic while greatly extending its power beyond Italy In 44 BC Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated by a faction that opposed his concentration of power This faction was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by Mark Antony and Caesars adopted son Octavian Antony and Octavian divided the Roman world between them but this did not last long Octavians forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC In 27 BC the Senate gave him the title Augustus venerated and made him princeps foremost with proconsular imperium thus beginning the Principate the first epoch of Roman imperial history Although the republic stood in name Augustus had all meaningful authority During his 40year rule a new constitutional order emerged so that upon his death Tiberius would succeed him as the new de facto monarch As Roman provinces were being established throughout the Mediterranean Italy maintained a special status which made it domina provinciarum ruler of the provinces and especially in relation to the first centuries of imperial stability rectrix mundi governor of the world and omnium terrarum parens parent of all lands Pax Romana The 200 years that began with Augustuss rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana Roman Peace The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down mercilessly and swiftly The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs The JulioClaudian dynasty lasted for four more emperorsTiberius Caligula Claudius and Nerobefore it yielded in 69 AD to the strifetorn Year of the Four Emperors from which Vespasian emerged as the victor Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty followed by the NervaAntonine dynasty which produced the Five Good Emperors Nerva Trajan Hadrian Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius Transition from classical to late antiquity In the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron a comment which has led some historians notably Edward Gibbon to take Commodus reign as the beginning of the Empires decline In 212 during the reign of Caracalla Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire The Severan dynasty was tumultuous an emperors reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution and following its collapse the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century a period of invasions civil strife economic disorder and plague In defining historical epochs this crisis sometimes marks the transition from Classical to Late Antiquity Aurelian r 270275 stabilised the empire militarily and Diocletian reorganised and restored much of it in 285 Diocletians reign brought the empires most concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity the Great Persecution Diocletian divided the empire into four regions each ruled by a separate tetrarch Confident that he fixed the disorder plaguing Rome he abdicated along with his coemperor but the Tetrarchy collapsed shortly after Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the Eastern Empire During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties the empire was divided along an eastwest axis with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome Julian who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors Theodosius I the last emperor to rule over both East and West died in 395 after making Christianity the state religion Fall in the West and survival in the East The Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century The Romans fought off all invaders most famously Attila but the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer Odoacer ended the Western Empire by declaring Zeno sole emperor and placing himself as Zenos nominal subordinate In reality Italy was ruled by Odoacer alone The Eastern Roman Empire called the Byzantine Empire by later historians continued until the reign of Constantine XI Palaiologos the last Roman emperor He died in battle in 1453 against Mehmed II and his Ottoman forces during the siege of Constantinople Mehmed II adopted the title of caesar in an attempt to claim a connection to the former Empire His claim was soon recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople but not by most European monarchs Geography and demography The Roman Empire was one of the largest in history with contiguous territories throughout Europe North Africa and the Middle East The Latin phrase imperium sine fine empire without end expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire In Virgils Aeneid limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by Jupiter This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century In addition to annexing large regions the Romans directly altered their geography for example cutting down entire forests Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century when Roman control in Europe Africa and Asia was strengthened Under Augustus a global map of the known world was displayed for the first time in public at Rome coinciding with the creation of the most comprehensive political geography that survives from antiquity the Geography of Strabo When Augustus died the account of his achievements Res Gestae prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of the Empire Geography alongside meticulous written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration The Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan r 98117 encompassing 5 million km2 The traditional population estimate of 5560 million inhabitants accounted for between onesixth and onefourth of the worlds total population and made it the most populous unified political entity in the West until the mid19th century Recent demographic studies have argued for a population peak from 70 million to more than 100 million Each of the three largest cities in the Empire Rome Alexandria and Antioch was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century As the historian Christopher Kelly described it Then the empire stretched from Hadrians Wall in drizzlesoaked northern England to the sunbaked banks of the Euphrates in Syria from the great RhineDanube river system which snaked across the fertile flat lands of Europe from the Low Countries to the Black Sea to the rich plains of the North African coast and the luxuriant gash of the Nile Valley in Egypt The empire completely circled the Mediterranean referred to by its conquerors as mare nostrumour sea Trajans successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire Borders fines were marked and the frontiers limites patrolled The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable Hadrians Wall which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an everpresent barbarian threat is the primary surviving monument of this effort Languages Latin and Greek were the main languages of the Empire but the Empire was deliberately multilingual Andrew WallaceHadrill says The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood At the start of the Empire knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military government or law Bilingual inscriptions indicate the everyday interpenetration of the two languages Latin and Greeks mutual linguistic and cultural influence is a complex topic Latin words incorporated into Greek were very common by the early imperial era especially for military administration and trade and commerce matters Greek grammar literature poetry and philosophy shaped Latin language and culture There was never a legal requirement for Latin in the Empire but it represented a certain status High standards of Latin Latinitas started with the advent of Latin literature Due to the flexible language policy of the Empire a natural competition of language emerged that spurred Latinitas to defend Latin against the stronger cultural influence of Greek Over time Latin usage was used to project power and a higher social class Most of the emperors were bilingual but had a preference for Latin in the public sphere for political reasons a rule that first started during the Punic Wars Different emperors up until Justinian would attempt to require the use of Latin in various sections of the administration but there is no evidence that a linguistic imperialism existed during the early Empire After all freeborn inhabitants were universally enfranchised in 212 many Roman citizens would have lacked a knowledge of Latin The wide use of Koine Greek was what enabled the spread of Christianity and reflects its role as the lingua franca of the Mediterranean during the time of the Empire Following Diocletians reforms in the 3rd century CE there was a decline in the knowledge of Greek in the west Spoken Latin later fragmented into the incipient romance languages in the 7th century CE following the collapse of the Empires west The dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite obscure the continuity of other spoken languages within the Empire Latin referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages particularly in Egypt with Coptic and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube Roman jurists also show a concern for local languages such as Punic Gaulish and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding of laws and oaths In Africa LibycoBerber and Punic were used in inscriptions into the 2nd century In Syria Palmyrene soldiers used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions an exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military The last reference to Gaulish was between 560 and 575 The emergent GalloRomance languages would then be shaped by Gaulish ProtoBasque or Aquitanian evolved with Latin loan words to modern Basque The Thracian language as were several nowextinct languages in Anatolia are attested in Imperialera inscriptions Society The Empire was remarkably multicultural with astonishing cohesive capacity to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples Public monuments and communal spaces open to allsuch as forums amphitheatres racetracks and bathshelped foster a sense of Romanness Roman society had multiple overlapping social hierarchies The civil war preceding Augustus caused upheaval but did not effect an immediate redistribution of wealth and social power From the perspective of the lower classes a peak was merely added to the social pyramid Personal relationshipspatronage friendship amicitia family marriagecontinued to influence politics By the time of Nero however it was not unusual to find a former slave who was richer than a freeborn citizen or an equestrian who exercised greater power than a senator The blurring of the Republics more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility both upward and downward to a greater extent than all other welldocumented ancient societies Women freedmen and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them Social life particularly for those whose personal resources were limited was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities collegia and sodalitates professional and trade guilds veterans groups religious sodalities drinking and dining clubs performing troupes and burial societies Legal status According to the jurist Gaius the essential distinction in the Roman law of persons was that all humans were either free liberi or slaves servi The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship Most citizens held limited rights such as the ius Latinum Latin right but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by noncitizens Free people not considered citizens but living within the Roman world were peregrini nonRomans In 212 the Constitutio Antoniniana extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire This legal egalitarianism required a farreaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and noncitizens Women in Roman law Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens but did not vote hold political office or serve in the military A mothers citizen status determined that of her children as indicated by the phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos children born of two Roman citizens A Roman woman kept her own family name nomen for life Children most often took the fathers name with some exceptions Women could own property enter contracts and engage in business Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works an indication they could hold considerable fortunes The archaic manus marriage in which the woman was subject to her husbands authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage Technically she remained under her fathers legal authority even though she moved into her husbands home but when her father died she became legally emancipated This arrangement was a factor in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed compared to many other cultures up to the modern period although she had to answer to her father in legal matters she was free of his direct scrutiny in daily life and her husband had no legal power over her Although it was a point of pride to be a oneman woman univira who had married only once there was little stigma attached to divorce nor to speedy remarriage after being widowed or divorced Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will A mothers right to own and dispose of property including setting the terms of her will gave her enormous influence over her sons into adulthood As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order moral legislation attempted to regulate conduct as a means of promoting family values Adultery was criminalized and defined broadly as an illicit sex act stuprum between a male citizen and a married woman or between a married woman and any man other than her husband That is a double standard was in place a married woman could have sex only with her husband but a married man did not commit adultery if he had sex with a prostitute or person of marginalized status Childbearing was encouraged a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honours and greater legal freedom the ius trium liberorum Slaves and the law At the time of Augustus as many as 35 of the people in Roman Italy were slaves making Rome one of five historical slave societies in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility In urban settings slaves might be professionals such as teachers physicians chefs and accountants the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour Agriculture and industry such as milling and mining relied on the exploitation of slaves Outside Italy slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20 of the population sparse in Roman Egypt but more concentrated in some Greek areas Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 6th and 7th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy Laws pertaining to slavery were extremely intricate Slaves were considered property and had no legal personhood They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens sexual exploitation torture and summary execution A slave could not as a matter of law be raped a slaves rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the Aquilian Law Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called conubium but their unions were sometimes recognized Technically a slave could not own property but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual fund peculium that he could use depending on the degree of trust and cooperation between owner and slave Within a household or workplace a hierarchy of slaves might exist with one slave acting as the master of others Talented slaves might accumulate a large enough peculium to justify their freedom or be manumitted for services rendered Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law Lex Fufia Caninia limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will Following the Servile Wars of the Republic legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups and for hunting down fugitive slaves Over time slaves gained increased legal protection including the right to file complaints against their masters A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution as prostitutes in ancient Rome were often slaves The burgeoning trade in eunuchs in the late 1st century prompted legislation that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will for lust or gain Roman slavery was not based on race Generally slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians with a minority of foreigners including both slaves and freedmen estimated at 5 of the total in the capital at its peak where their number was largest Foreign slaves had higher mortality and lower birth rates than natives and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was seventeen and a half years 172 for males 179 for females During the period of republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive war captives were a main source of slaves The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war and the conquest of Greece brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves Slaves were also traded in markets and sometimes sold by pirates Infant abandonment and selfenslavement among the poor were other sources Vernae by contrast were homegrown slaves born to female slaves within the household estate or farm Although they had no special legal status an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his vernae faced social disapproval as they were considered part of the family household and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family Freedmen Rome differed from Greek citystates in allowing freed slaves to become citizens any future children of a freedman were born free with full rights of citizenship After manumission a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom libertas including the right to vote His former master became his patron patronus the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods but could play a priestly role He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself but during the early Empire freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law The rise of successful freedmenthrough political influence or wealthis a characteristic of early Imperial society The prosperity of a highachieving group of freedmen is attested by inscriptions throughout the Empire Census rank The Latin word ordo plural ordines is translated variously and inexactly into English as class order rank One purpose of the Roman census was to determine the ordo to which an individual belonged Two of the highest ordines in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian Outside Rome cities or colonies were led by decurions also known as curiales Senator was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an executive magistrate A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million sestertii Not all men who qualified for the ordo senatorius chose to take a Senate seat which required legal domicile at Rome Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600member body by appointment A senators son belonged to the ordo senatorius but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate A senator could be removed for violating moral standards In the time of Nero senators were still primarily from Italy with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France men from the Greekspeaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian The first senator from the easternmost province Cappadocia was admitted under Marcus Aurelius By the Severan dynasty 193235 Italians made up less than half the Senate During the 3rd century domicile at Rome became impractical and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland patria Senators were the traditional governing class who rose through the cursus honorum the political career track but equestrians often possessed greater wealth and political power Membership in the equestrian order was based on property in Romes early days equites or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire A census valuation of 400000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified and in 14 AD a thousand equestrians were registered at Cdiz and Padua alone Equestrians rose through a military career track tres militiae to become highly placed prefects and procurators within the Imperial administration The rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the early Empire Roman aristocracy was based on competition and unlike later European nobility a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands Admission to the higher ordines brought distinction and privileges but also responsibilities In antiquity a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works events and services munera Maintaining ones rank required massive personal expenditures Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire as the ranks of the town councils became depleted those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged to return to their hometowns in an effort to sustain civic life In the later Empire the dignitas worth esteem that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as vir illustris illustrious man The appellation clarissimus Greek lamprotatos was used to designate the dignitas of certain senators and their immediate family including women Grades of equestrian status proliferated Unequal justice As the republican principle of citizens equality under the law faded the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours honestiores and humbler folk humiliores In general honestiores were the members of the three higher orders along with certain military officers The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed particularly within the justice system Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative worth dignitas of the defendant an honestior could pay a fine for a crime for which an humilior might receive a scourging Execution which was an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic could be quick and relatively painless for honestiores while humiliores might suffer the kinds of torturous death previously reserved for slaves such as crucifixion and condemnation to the beasts In the early Empire those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as honestiores especially if they declined to fulfil religious responsibilities and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of martyrdom Government and military The three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government the military and the provincial government The military established control of a territory through war but after a city or people was brought under treaty the mission turned to policing protecting Roman citizens agricultural fields and religious sites The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone Cooperation with local elites was necessary to maintain order collect information and extract revenue The Romans often exploited internal political divisions Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws could collect their own taxes locally and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation Legal privileges and relative independence incentivized compliance Roman government was thus limited but efficient in its use of available resources Central government The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with divinely sanctioned authority auctoritas The rite of apotheosis also called consecratio signified the deceased emperors deification The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of powers from several republican offices The emperor made himself the central religious authority as pontifex maximus and centralized the right to declare war ratify treaties and negotiate with foreign leaders While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate the emperors powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical culminating in the Dominate The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy and decisionmaking but in the early Principate he was expected to be accessible and deal personally with official business and petitions A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually The JulioClaudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians but trusted slaves and freedmen After Nero the influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion and the emperors council consilium became subject to official appointment for greater transparency Though the Senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the Antonine dynasty equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium The women of the emperors family often intervened directly in his decisions Access to the emperor might be gained at the daily reception salutatio a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron public banquets hosted at the palace and religious ceremonies The common people who lacked this access could manifest their approval or displeasure as a group at games By the 4th century the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings no longer responding to individual petitions Although the Senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor it retained its symbolic political centrality The Senate legitimated the emperors rule and the emperor employed senators as legates legati generals diplomats and administrators The practical source of an emperors power and authority was the military The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury and swore an annual oath of loyalty to the emperor Most emperors chose a successor usually a close family member or adopted heir The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape No emperor could hope to survive without the allegiance of the Praetorian Guard and the legions To secure their loyalty several emperors paid the donativum a monetary reward In theory the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians Military After the Punic Wars the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism under which an army of conscript citizens defended the homeland against a specific threat The Romans expanded their war machine by organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army By Imperial times military service was a fulltime career The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of Romanization The primary mission of the military of the early empire was to preserve the Pax Romana The three major divisions of the military were the garrison at Rome comprising the Praetorian Guard the cohortes urbanae and the vigiles who functioned as police and firefighters the provincial army comprising the Roman legions and the auxiliaries provided by the provinces auxilia the navy Through his military reforms which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty Augustus regularized the legion A legion was organized into ten cohorts each of which comprised six centuries with a century further made up of ten squads contubernia the exact size of the Imperial legion which was likely determined by logistics has been estimated to range from 4800 to 5280 After Germanic tribes wiped out three legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD the number of legions was increased from 25 to around 30 The army had about 300000 soldiers in the 1st century and under 400000 in the 2nd significantly smaller than the collective armed forces of the conquered territories No more than 2 of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army Augustus also created the Praetorian Guard nine cohorts ostensibly to maintain the public peace which were garrisoned in Italy Better paid than the legionaries the Praetorians served only sixteen years The auxilia were recruited from among the noncitizens Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength they were paid less than the legionaries and after 25 years of service were rewarded with Roman citizenship also extended to their sons According to Tacitus there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionariesthus around 125000 men implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments The Roman cavalry of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic Hispanic or Germanic areas Several aspects of training and equipment derived from the Celts The Roman navy not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions but also in the protection of the frontiers along the rivers Rhine and Danube Another duty was protecting maritime trade against pirates It patrolled the Mediterranean parts of the North Atlantic coasts and the Black Sea Nevertheless the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch Provincial government An annexed territory became a Roman province in three steps making a register of cities taking a census and surveying the land Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths real estate transactions taxes and juridical proceedings In the 1st and 2nd centuries the central government sent out around 160 officials annually to govern outside Italy Among these officials were the Roman governors magistrates elected at Rome who in the name of the Roman people governed senatorial provinces or governors usually of equestrian rank who held their imperium on behalf of the emperor in imperial provinces most notably Roman Egypt A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed but he could delegate various duties His staff however was minimal his official attendants apparitores including lictors heralds messengers scribes and bodyguards legates both civil and military usually of equestrian rank and friends who accompanied him unofficially Other officials were appointed as supervisors of government finances Separating fiscal responsibility from justice and administration was a reform of the Imperial era to avoid provincial governors and tax farmers exploiting local populations for personal gain Equestrian procurators whose authority was originally extrajudicial and extraconstitutional managed both stateowned property and the personal property of the emperor res privata Because Roman government officials were few a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity Law Roman courts held original jurisdiction over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had wellestablished law codes and juridical procedures Generally it was Roman policy to respect the mos regionis regional tradition or law of the land and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying ius gentium the law of nations or international law regarded as common and customary If provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom Roman courts heard appeals and the emperor held final decisionmaking authority In the West law had been administered on a highly localized or tribal basis and private property rights may have been a novelty of the Roman era particularly among Celts Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a proRoman elite The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law replacing local law codes that had applied to noncitizens Diocletians efforts to stabilize the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century included two major compilations of law in four years the Codex Gregorianus and the Codex Hermogenianus to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards The pervasiveness of Roman law throughout Western Europe enormously influenced the Western legal tradition reflected by continued use of Latin legal terminology in modern law Taxation Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5 of its gross product The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5 The tax code was bewildering in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes some paid in cash and some in kind Taxes might be specific to a province or kinds of properties such as fisheries they might be temporary Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty Inkind taxes were accepted from lessmonetized areas particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity Tax obligations were determined by the census each head of household provided a headcount of his household as well as an accounting of his property A major source of indirecttax revenue was the portoria customs and tolls on trade including among provinces Towards the end of his reign Augustus instituted a 4 tax on the sale of slaves which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers who responded by raising their prices An owner who manumitted a slave paid a freedom tax calculated at 5 of value An inheritance tax of 5 was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone outside their immediate family Revenues from the estate tax and from an auction tax went towards the veterans pension fund aerarium militare Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the superrich but in the later period the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire Economy The Empire is best thought of as a network of regional economies based on a form of political capitalism in which the state regulated commerce to assure its own revenues Economic growth though not comparable to modern economies was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization Territorial conquests permitted a largescale reorganization of land use that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization particularly in north Africa Some cities were known for particular industries The scale of urban building indicates a significant construction industry Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of economic rationalism and the Empire was highly monetized Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly and trade routes connected regional economies The supply contracts for the army drew on local suppliers near the base castrum throughout the province and across provincial borders Economic historians vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product during the Principate In the sample years of 14 100 and 150 AD estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 HS The GDP per capita of Italy is estimated as 40 to 66 higher than in the rest of the Empire due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income Economic dynamism resulted in social mobility Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society wealth requirements for rank indicate a strong tendency towards plutocracy Prestige could be obtained through investing ones wealth in grand estates or townhouses luxury items public entertainments funerary monuments and religious dedications Guilds collegia and corporations corpora provided support for individuals to succeed through networking There can be little doubt that the lower classes of provincial towns of the Roman Empire enjoyed a high standard of living not equaled again in Western Europe until the 19th century Households in the top 15 of income distribution captured about 20 of income The vast majority produced more than half of the total income but lived near subsistence Currency and banking The early Empire was monetized to a nearuniversal extent using money as a way to express prices and debts The sestertius English sesterces symbolized as HS was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 4th century though the silver denarius worth four sesterces was also used beginning in the Severan dynasty The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze as onetenth denarius Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as pecunia money and were used only on the frontiers Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins rather than weighing theman indication that the coin was valued on its face This tendency towards fiat money led to the debasement of Roman coinage in the later Empire The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving Rome had no central bank and regulation of the banking system was minimal Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers deposits A typical bank had fairly limited capital and often only one principal Seneca assumes that anyone involved in Roman commerce needs access to credit A professional deposit banker received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term and lent money to third parties The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending both as creditors and borrowers The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party without cash changing hands Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked documentary transactions the system of banks throughout the Empire permitted the exchange of large sums without physically transferring coins in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire in 33 AD generally available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers The central government itself did not borrow money and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties debased the currency particularly the denarius under the pressures of meeting military payrolls Sudden inflation under Commodus damaged the credit market In the mid200s the supply of specie contracted sharply Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Centurysuch as reductions in longdistance trade disruption of mining operations and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemiesgreatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian and bankers lost confidence in coins Despite Diocletians introduction of the gold solidus and monetary reforms the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness Mining and metallurgy The main mining regions of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula silver copper lead iron and gold Gaul gold silver iron Britain mainly iron lead tin the Danubian provinces gold iron Macedonia and Thrace gold silver and Asia Minor gold silver iron tin Intensive largescale miningof alluvial deposits and by means of opencast mining and underground miningtook place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century when the instability of the Empire disrupted production Hydraulic mining allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a protoindustrial scale The total annual iron output is estimated at 82500 tonnes Copper and lead production levels were unmatched until the Industrial Revolution At its peak around the mid2nd century the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10000 t five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800 AD As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over prehistoric levels during the Imperial era and dropped thereafter Transportation and communication The Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean which they called our sea Mare Nostrum Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as major rivers Transport by water was preferred where possible as moving commodities by land was more difficult Vehicles wheels and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers Land transport utilized the advanced system of Roman roads called viae These roads were primarily built for military purposes but also served commercial ends The inkind taxes paid by communities included the provision of personnel animals or vehicles for the cursus publicus the state mail and transport service established by Augustus Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles and tended to grow into villages or trading posts A mansio plural mansiones was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the cursus publicus The distance between mansiones was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day Carts were usually pulled by mules travelling about 4 mph Trade and commodities Roman provinces traded among themselves but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as China and India Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the Silk Road Indian trade also occurred by sea from Egyptian ports The main commodity was grain Also traded were olive oil foodstuffs garum fish sauce slaves ore and manufactured metal objects fibres and textiles timber pottery glassware marble papyrus spices and materia medica ivory pearls and gemstones Though most provinces could produce wine regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central trade good Labour and occupations Inscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii Professional associations or trade guilds collegia are attested for a wide range of occupations some quite specialized Work performed by slaves falls into five general categories domestic with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs imperial or public service urban crafts and services agriculture and mining Convicts provided much of the labour in the mines or quarries where conditions were notoriously brutal In practice there was little division of labour between slave and free and most workers were illiterate and without special skills The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture in Italian industrial farming latifundia these may have been mostly slaves but elsewhere slave farm labour was probably less important Textile and clothing production was a major source of employment Both textiles and finished garments were traded and products were often named for peoples or towns like a fashion label Better readytowear was exported by local businessmen negotiatores or mercatores Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents by vestiarii clothing dealers or peddled by itinerant merchants The fullers fullones and dye workers coloratores had their own guilds Centonarii were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into pieced goods Architecture and engineering The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch vault and dome Some Roman structures still stand today due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete Roman temples developed Etruscan and Greek forms with some distinctive elements Roman roads are considered the most advanced built until the early 19th century Roman bridges were among the first large and lasting bridges built from stone and in most cases concrete with the arch as the basic structure The largest Roman bridge was Trajans bridge over the lower Danube constructed by Apollodorus of Damascus which remained for over a millennium the longest bridge to have been built The Romans built many dams and reservoirs for water collection such as the Subiaco Dams two of which fed the Anio Novus one of the largest aqueducts of Rome The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts De aquaeductu a treatise by Frontinus who served as water commissioner reflects the administrative importance placed on the water supply Masonry channels carried water along a precise gradient using gravity alone It was then collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains baths toilets or industrial sites The main aqueducts in Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120 km away along a route of more than 336 km Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance and to a technological standard not equalled until modern times The Romans also used aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire Insulated glazing or double glazing was used in the construction of public baths Elite housing in cooler climates might have hypocausts a form of central heating The Romans were the first culture to assemble all essential components of the much later steam engine the crank and connecting rod system Heros aeolipile generating steam power the cylinder and piston in metal force pumps nonreturn valves in water pumps and gearing in water mills and clocks Daily life City and country The city was viewed as fostering civilization by being properly designed ordered and adorned Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods vici administered at the local level with police and firefighting services A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the Campus Martius an open area outside the city centre the Altar of Augustan Peace Ara Pacis Augustae was located there as was an obelisk imported from Egypt that formed the pointer gnomon of a horologium With its public gardens the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit City planning and urban lifestyles was influenced by the Greeks early on and in the Eastern Empire Roman rule shaped the development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character Cities such as Athens Aphrodisias Ephesus and Gerasa tailored city planning and architecture to imperial ideals while expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence In areas inhabited by Celticspeaking peoples Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples forums monumental fountains and amphitheatres often on or near the sites of preexisting walled settlements known as oppida Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic coastal cities The network of cities coloniae municipia civitates or in Greek terms poleis was a primary cohesive force during the Pax Romana Romans of the 1st and 2nd centuries were encouraged to inculcate the habits of peacetime As the classicist Clifford Ando noted Most of the cultural appurtenances popularly associated with imperial culturepublic cult and its games and civic banquets competitions for artists speakers and athletes as well as the funding of the great majority of public buildings and public display of artwere financed by private individuals whose expenditures in this regard helped to justify their economic power and legal and provincial privileges In the city of Rome most people lived in multistory apartment buildings insulae that were often squalid firetraps Public facilitiessuch as baths thermae toilets with running water latrinae basins or elaborate fountains nymphea delivering fresh water and largescale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combatwere aimed primarily at the common people The public baths served hygienic social and cultural functions Bathing was the focus of daily socializing Roman baths were distinguished by a series of rooms that offered communal bathing in three temperatures with amenities that might include an exercise room sauna exfoliation spa ball court or outdoor swimming pool Baths had hypocaust heating the floors were suspended over hotair channels Public baths were part of urban culture throughout the provinces but in the late 4th century individual tubs began to replace communal bathing Christians were advised to go to the baths only for hygiene Rich families from Rome usually had two or more houses a townhouse domus and at least one luxury home villa outside the city The domus was a privately owned singlefamily house and might be furnished with a private bath balneum but it was not a place to retreat from public life Although some neighbourhoods show a higher concentration of such houses they were not segregated enclaves The domus was meant to be visible and accessible The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias head of household met with clients every morning It was a centre of family religious rites containing a shrine and images of family ancestors The houses were located on busy public roads and groundlevel spaces were often rented out as shops tabernae In addition to a kitchen gardenwindowboxes might substitute in the insulaetownhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden The villa by contrast was an escape from the city and in literature represents a lifestyle that balances intellectual and artistic interests otium with an appreciation of nature and agriculture Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista carefully framed by the architectural design Augustus programme of urban renewal and the growth of Romes population to as many as one million was accompanied by nostalgia for rural life Poetry idealized the lives of farmers and shepherds Interior decorating often featured painted gardens fountains landscapes vegetative ornament and animals rendered accurately enough to be identified by species On a more practical level the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture Producing food was the priority of land use Larger farms latifundia achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire and new crops were introduced from one province to another Maintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic when the state began to provide a grain dole Cura Annonae to citizens who registered for it about 200000250000 adult males in Rome The dole cost at least 15 of state revenues but improved living conditions among the lower classes and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on estates The grain dole also had symbolic value it affirmed the emperors position as universal benefactor and the right of citizens to share in the fruits of conquest The annona public facilities and spectacular entertainments mitigated the otherwise dreary living conditions of lowerclass Romans and kept social unrest in check The satirist Juvenal however saw bread and circuses panem et circenses as emblematic of the loss of republican political liberty The public has long since cast off its cares the people that once bestowed commands consulships legions and all else now meddles no more and longs eagerly for just two things bread and circuses Health and disease Epidemics were common in the ancient world and occasional pandemics in the Empire killed millions The Roman population was unhealthy About 20 percenta large percentage by ancient standardslived in cities Rome being the largest The cities were a demographic sink the death rate exceeded the birth rate and constant immigration was necessary to maintain the population Average lifespan is estimated at the midtwenties and perhaps more than half of children died before reaching adulthood Dense urban populations and poor sanitation contributed to disease Land and sea connections facilitated and sped the transfer of infectious diseases across the empires territories The rich were not immune only two of emperor Marcus Aureliuss fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood The importance of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as Galen 2nd century Views on nutrition were influenced by beliefs like humoral theory A good indicator of nutrition and disease burden is average height the average Roman was shorter in stature than the population of preRoman Italian societies and medieval Europe Food and dining Most apartments in Rome lacked kitchens though a charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars inns and food stalls tabernae cauponae popinae thermopolia Carryout and restaurants were for the lower classes fine dining appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a chef archimagirus and kitchen staff or banquets hosted by social clubs collegia Most Romans consumed at least 70 of their daily calories in the form of cereals and legumes Puls pottage was considered the food of the Romans and could be elaborated to produce dishes similar to polenta or risotto Urban populations and the military preferred bread By the reign of Aurelian the state had begun to distribute the annona as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories and added olive oil wine and pork to the dole Roman literature focuses on the dining habits of the upper classes for whom the evening meal cena had important social functions Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room triclinium furnished with couches By the late Republic women dined reclined and drank wine along with men The poet Martial describes a dinner beginning with the gustatio tasting or appetizer salad The main course was kid beans greens a chicken and leftover ham followed by a dessert of fruit and wine Roman foodies indulged in wild game fowl such as peacock and flamingo large fish mullet was especially prized and shellfish Luxury ingredients were imported from the far reaches of empire A booklength collection of Roman recipes is attributed to Apicius a name for several figures in antiquity that became synonymous with gourmet Refined cuisine could be moralized as a sign of either civilized progress or decadent decline Most often because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture producecereals legumes vegetables and fruitwere considered more civilized foods than meat The Mediterranean staples of bread wine and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism Some philosophers and Christians resisted the demands of the body and the pleasures of food and adopted fasting as an ideal Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished and trade routes were disrupted the Church formally discouraged gluttony and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple and virtuous Spectacles When Juvenal complained that the Roman people had exchanged their political liberty for bread and circuses he was referring to the stateprovided grain dole and the circenses events held in the entertainment venue called a circus The largest such venue in Rome was the Circus Maximus the setting of horse races chariot races the equestrian Troy Game staged beast hunts venationes athletic contests gladiator combat and historical reenactments From earliest times several religious festivals had featured games ludi primarily horse and chariot races ludi circenses The races retained religious significance in connection with agriculture initiation and the cycle of birth and death Under Augustus public entertainments were presented on 77 days of the year by the reign of Marcus Aurelius this had expanded to 135 Circus games were preceded by an elaborate parade pompa circensis that ended at the venue Competitive events were held also in smaller venues such as the amphitheatre which became the characteristic Roman spectacle venue and stadium Greekstyle athletics included footraces boxing wrestling and the pancratium Aquatic displays such as the mock sea battle naumachia and a form of water ballet were presented in engineered pools Statesupported theatrical events ludi scaenici took place on temple steps or in grand stone theatres or in the smaller enclosed theatre called an odeon Circuses were the largest structure regularly built in the Roman world The Flavian Amphitheatre better known as the Colosseum became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome Many Roman amphitheatres circuses and theatres built in cities outside Italy are visible as ruins today The local ruling elite were responsible for sponsoring spectacles and arena events which both enhanced their status and drained their resources The physical arrangement of the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society the emperor in his opulent box senators and equestrians in reserved advantageous seats women seated at a remove from the action slaves given the worst places and everybody else inbetween The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering but the emperor had the final say Spectacles could quickly become sites of social and political protest and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest most notoriously at the Nika riots in 532 The chariot teams were known by the colours they wore Fan loyalty was fierce and at times erupted into sports riots Racing was perilous but charioteers were among the most celebrated and wellcompensated athletes Circuses were designed to ensure that no team had an unfair advantage and to minimize collisions naufragia which were nonetheless frequent and satisfying to the crowd The races retained a magical aura through their early association with chthonic rituals circus images were considered protective or lucky curse tablets have been found buried at the site of racetracks and charioteers were often suspected of sorcery Chariot racing continued into the Byzantine period under imperial sponsorship but the decline of cities in the 6th and 7th centuries led to its eventual demise The Romans thought gladiator contests had originated with funeral games and sacrifices Some of the earliest styles of gladiator fighting had ethnic designations such as Thracian or Gallic The staged combats were considered munera services offerings benefactions initially distinct from the festival games ludi To mark the opening of the Colosseum Titus presented 100 days of arena events with 3000 gladiators competing on a single day Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics wall paintings lamps and in graffiti Gladiators were trained combatants who might be slaves convicts or free volunteers Death was not a necessary or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters whose training was costly and timeconsuming By contrast noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena with little or no training often unarmed and with no expectation of survival physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as reenactments of myths and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects Modern scholars have found the pleasure Romans took in the theatre of life and death difficult to understand Pliny the Younger rationalized gladiator spectacles as good for the people to inspire them to face honourable wounds and despise death by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory Some Romans such as Seneca were critical of the brutal spectacles but found virtue in the courage and dignity of the defeated fighteran attitude that finds its fullest expression with the Christians martyred in the arena Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressedup form of human sacrifice Even martyr literature however offers detailed indeed luxuriant descriptions of bodily suffering and became a popular genre at times indistinguishable from fiction Recreation The singular ludus play game sport training had a wide range of meanings such as word play theatrical performance board game primary school and even gladiator training school as in Ludus Magnus Activities for children and young people in the Empire included hoop rolling and knucklebones astragali or jacks Girls had dolls made of wood terracotta and especially bone and ivory Ball games include trigon and harpastum People of all ages played board games including latrunculi Raiders and XII scripta Twelve Marks A game referred to as alea dice or tabula the board may have been similar to backgammon Dicing as a form of gambling was disapproved of but was a popular pastime during the festival of the Saturnalia After adolescence most physical training for males was of a military nature The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men learned horsemanship and warfare Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime According to Plutarch conservative Romans disapproved of Greekstyle athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake and condemned Neros efforts to encourage Greekstyle athletic games Some women trained as gymnasts and dancers and a rare few as female gladiators The Bikini Girls mosaic shows young women engaging in routines comparable to rhythmic gymnastics Women were encouraged to maintain health through activities such as playing ball swimming walking or reading aloud as a breathing exercise Clothing In a statusconscious society like that of the Romans clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order There is little direct evidence of how Romans dressed in daily life since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value and surviving textiles are rare The toga was the distinctive national garment of the male citizen but it was heavy and impractical worn mainly for conducting political or court business and religious rites It was a vast expanse of semicircular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance The drapery became more intricate and structured over time The toga praetexta with a purple or purplishred stripe representing inviolability was worn by children who had not come of age curule magistrates and state priests Only the emperor could wear an allpurple toga toga picta Ordinary clothing was dark or colourful The basic garment for all Romans regardless of gender or wealth was the simple sleeved tunic with length differing by wearer The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural dull shades finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen A man of the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes clavi woven vertically the wider the stripe the higher the wearers status Other garments could be layered over the tunic Common male attire also included cloaks and in some regions trousers In the 2nd century emperors and elite men are often portrayed wearing the pallium an originally Greek mantle women are also portrayed in the pallium Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians in contrast to the toga and for educated people Roman clothing styles changed over time In the Dominate clothing worn by both soldiers and bureaucrats became highly decorated with geometrical patterns stylized plant motifs and in more elaborate examples human or animal figures Courtiers of the later Empire wore elaborate silk robes The militarization of Roman society and the waning of urban life affected fashion heavy militarystyle belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers and the toga was abandoned replaced by the pallium as a garment embodying social unity Arts Greek art had a profound influence on Roman art Public artincluding sculpture monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches and the iconography on coinsis often analysed for historical or ideological significance In the private sphere artistic objects were made for religious dedications funerary commemoration domestic use and commerce The wealthy advertised their appreciation of culture through artwork and decorative arts in their homes Despite the value placed on art even famous artists were of low social status partly as they worked with their hands Portraiture Portraiture which survives mainly in sculpture was the most copious form of imperial art Portraits during the Augustan period utilize classical proportions evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism Republican portraits were characterized by verism but as early as the 2nd century BC Greek heroic nudity was adopted for conquering generals Imperial portrait sculptures may model a mature head atop a youthful nude or seminude body with perfect musculature Clothed in the toga or military regalia the body communicates rank or role not individual characteristics Portraiture in painting is represented primarily by the Fayum mummy portraits which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with realistic painting Marble portrait sculpture were painted but traces have rarely survived Sculpture and sarcophagi Examples of Roman sculpture survive abundantly though often in damaged or fragmentary condition including freestanding statuary in marble bronze and terracotta and reliefs from public buildings and monuments Niches in amphitheatres were originally filled with statues as were formal gardens Temples housed cult images of deities often by famed sculptors Elaborately carved marble and limestone sarcophagi are characteristic of the 2nd to 4th centuries Sarcophagus relief has been called the richest single source of Roman iconography depicting mythological scenes or JewishChristian imagery as well as the deceaseds life Painting Initial Roman painting drew from Etruscan and Greek models and techniques Examples of Roman paintings can be found in palaces catacombs and villas Much of what is known of Roman painting is from the interior decoration of private homes particularly as preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius In addition to decorative borders and panels with geometric or vegetative motifs wall painting depicts scenes from mythology and theatre landscapes and gardens spectacles everyday life and erotic art Mosaic Mosaics are among the most enduring of Roman decorative arts and are found on floors and other architectural features The most common is the tessellated mosaic formed from uniform pieces tesserae of materials such as stone and glass Opus sectile is a related technique in which flat stone usually coloured marble is cut precisely into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed This more difficult technique became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 4th century eg the Basilica of Junius Bassus Figurative mosaics share many themes with painting and in some cases use almost identical compositions Geometric patterns and mythological scenes occur throughout the Empire In North Africa a particularly rich source of mosaics homeowners often chose scenes of life on their estates hunting agriculture and local wildlife Plentiful and major examples of Roman mosaics come also from presentday Turkey particularly the Antioch mosaics Italy southern France Spain and Portugal Decorative arts Decorative arts for luxury consumers included fine pottery silver and bronze vessels and implements and glassware Pottery manufacturing was economically important as were the glass and metalworking industries Imports stimulated new regional centres of production Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer redgloss pottery terra sigillata that was a major trade good in 1stcentury Europe Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC and by the 3rd century Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass Performing arts In Roman tradition borrowed from the Greeks literary theatre was performed by allmale troupes that used face masks with exaggerated facial expressions to portray emotion Female roles were played by men in drag travesti Roman literary theatre tradition is represented in Latin literature by the tragedies of Seneca for example More popular than literary theatre was the genredefying mimus theatre which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation risqu language and sex scenes action sequences and political satire along with dance juggling acrobatics tightrope walking striptease and dancing bears Unlike literary theatre mimus was played without masks and encouraged stylistic realism Female roles were performed by women Mimus was related to pantomimus an early form of story ballet that contained no spoken dialogue but rather a sung libretto often mythological either tragic or comic Although sometimes regarded as foreign music and dance existed in Rome from earliest times Music was customary at funerals and the tibia a woodwind instrument was played at sacrifices Song carmen was integral to almost every social occasion Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos Various woodwinds and brass instruments were played as were stringed instruments such as the cithara and percussion The cornu a long tubular metal wind instrument was used for military signals and on parade These instruments spread throughout the provinces and are widely depicted in Roman art The hydraulic pipe organ hydraulis was one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity and accompanied gladiator games and events in the amphitheatre Although certain dances were seen at times as nonRoman or unmanly dancing was embedded in religious rituals of archaic Rome Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the mystery religions particularly the cults of Cybele and Isis In the secular realm dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular Like gladiators entertainers were legally infames technically free but little better than slaves Stars however could enjoy considerable wealth and celebrity and mingled socially and often sexually with the elite Performers supported each other by forming guilds and several memorials for theatre members survive Theatre and dance were often condemned by Christian polemicists in the later Empire Literacy books and education Estimates of the average literacy rate range from 5 to over 30 The Roman obsession with documents and inscriptions indicates the value placed on the written word Laws and edicts were posted as well as read out Illiterate Roman subjects could have a government scribe scriba read or write their official documents for them The military produced extensive written records The Babylonian Talmud declared if all seas were ink all reeds were pen all skies parchment and all men scribes they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman governments concerns Numeracy was necessary for commerce Slaves were numerate and literate in significant numbers some were highly educated Graffiti and lowquality inscriptions with misspellings and solecisms indicate casual literacy among nonelites The Romans had an extensive priestly archive and inscriptions appear throughout the Empire in connection with votives dedicated by ordinary people as well as magic spells eg the Greek Magical Papyri Books were expensive since each copy had to be written out on a papyrus roll volumen by scribes The codexpages bound to a spinewas still a novelty in the 1st century but by the end of the 3rd century was replacing the volumen Commercial book production was established by the late Republic and by the 1st century certain neighbourhoods of Rome and Western provincial cities were known for their bookshops The quality of editing varied wildly and plagiarism or forgery were common since there was no copyright law Collectors amassed personal libraries and a fine library was part of the cultivated leisure otium associated with the villa lifestyle Significant collections might attract inhouse scholars and an individual benefactor might endow a community with a library as Pliny the Younger did in Comum Imperial libraries were open to users on a limited basis and represented a literary canon Books considered subversive might be publicly burned and Domitian crucified copyists for reproducing works deemed treasonous Literary texts were often shared aloud at meals or with reading groups Public readings recitationes expanded from the 1st through the 3rd century giving rise to consumer literature for entertainment Illustrated books including erotica were popular but are poorly represented by extant fragments Literacy began to decline during the Crisis of the Third Century The emperor Julian banned Christians from teaching the classical curriculum but the Church Fathers and other Christians adopted Latin and Greek literature philosophy and science in biblical interpretation As the Western Roman Empire declined reading became rarer even for those within the Church hierarchy although it continued in the Byzantine Empire Education Traditional Roman education was moral and practical Stories were meant to instil Roman values mores maiorum Parents were expected to act as role models and working parents passed their skills to their children who might also enter apprenticeships Young children were attended by a pedagogue usually a Greek slave or former slave who kept the child safe taught selfdiscipline and public behaviour attended class and helped with tutoring Formal education was available only to families who could pay for it lack of state support contributed to low literacy Primary education in reading writing and arithmetic might take place at home if parents hired or bought a teacher Other children attended public schools organized by a schoolmaster ludimagister paid by parents Vernae homeborn slave children might share inhome or public schooling Boys and girls received primary education generally from ages 7 to 12 but classes were not segregated by grade or age Most schools employed corporal punishment For the socially ambitious education in Greek as well as Latin was necessary Schools became more numerous during the Empire increasing educational opportunities At the age of 14 upperclass males made their rite of passage into adulthood and began to learn leadership roles through mentoring from a senior family member or family friend Higher education was provided by grammatici or rhetores The grammaticus or grammarian taught mainly Greek and Latin literature with history geography philosophy or mathematics treated as explications of the text With the rise of Augustus contemporary Latin authors such as Virgil and Livy also became part of the curriculum The rhetor was a teacher of oratory or public speaking The art of speaking ars dicendi was highly prized and eloquentia speaking ability eloquence was considered the glue of civilized society Rhetoric was not so much a body of knowledge though it required a command of the literary canon as it was a mode of expression that distinguished those who held social power The ancient model of rhetorical trainingrestraint coolness under pressure modesty and good humourendured into the 18th century as a Western educational ideal In Latin illiteratus could mean both unable to read and write and lacking in cultural awareness or sophistication Higher education promoted career advancement Urban elites throughout the Empire shared a literary culture imbued with Greek educational ideals paideia Hellenistic cities sponsored schools of higher learning to express cultural achievement Young Roman men often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy mostly to Athens The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training On the Hellenistic model Vespasian endowed chairs of grammar Latin and Greek rhetoric and philosophy at Rome and gave secondary teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties In the Eastern Empire Berytus presentday Beirut was unusual in offering a Latin education and became famous for its school of Roman law The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic 1st3rd century AD promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social educational and esthetic values Literate women ranged from cultured aristocrats to girls trained to be calligraphers and scribes The ideal woman in Augustan love poetry was educated and wellversed in the arts Education seems to have been standard for daughters of the senatorial and equestrian orders An educated wife was an asset for the socially ambitious household Literature Literature under Augustus along with that of the Republic has been viewed as the Golden Age of Latin literature embodying classical ideals The three most influential Classical Latin poetsVirgil Horace and Ovidbelong to this period Virgils Aeneid was a national epic in the manner of the Homeric epics of Greece Horace perfected the use of Greek lyric metres in Latin verse Ovids erotic poetry was enormously popular but ran afoul of Augustan morality contributing to his exile Ovids Metamorphoses wove together GrecoRoman mythology his versions of Greek myths became a primary source of later classical mythology and his work was hugely influential on medieval literature The early Principate produced satirists such as Persius and Juvenal The mid1st through mid2nd century has conventionally been called the Silver Age of Latin literature The three leading writersSeneca Lucan and Petroniuscommitted suicide after incurring Neros displeasure Epigrammatist and social observer Martial and the epic poet Statius whose poetry collection Silvae influenced Renaissance literature wrote during the reign of Domitian Other authors of the Silver Age included Pliny the Elder author of the encyclopedic Natural History his nephew Pliny the Younger and the historian Tacitus The principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the historian Livy whose account of Romes founding became the most familiar version in modernera literature The Twelve Caesars by Suetonius is a primary source for imperial biography Among Imperial historians who wrote in Greek are Dionysius of Halicarnassus Josephus and Cassius Dio Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer Plutarch the geographer Strabo and the rhetorician and satirist Lucian From the 2nd to the 4th centuries Christian authors were in active dialogue with the classical tradition Tertullian was one of the earliest prose authors with a distinctly Christian voice After the conversion of Constantine Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective In the late 4th century Jerome produced the Latin translation of the Bible that became authoritative as the Vulgate Around that same time Augustine wrote The City of God against the Pagans considered a masterpiece of Western culture In contrast to the unity of Classical Latin the literary esthetic of late antiquity has a tessellated quality A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century with the Saturnalia of Macrobius and The Marriage of Philology and Mercury of Martianus Capella Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius Prudentius Claudian and Sidonius Apollinaris Religion The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious and attributed their success to their collective piety pietas and good relations with the gods pax deorum The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest kings of Rome was the foundation of the mos maiorum the way of the ancestors central to Roman identity Roman religion was practical and contractual based on the principle of do ut des I give that you might give Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer ritual and sacrifice not on faith or dogma although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine For ordinary Romans religion was a part of daily life Each home had a household shrine to offer prayers and libations to the familys domestic deities Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances as many as 135 days were devoted to religious festivals and games ludi In the wake of the Republics collapse state religion adapted to support the new regime Augustus justified oneman rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform Public vows now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor Socalled emperor worship expanded on a grand scale the traditional veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius the divine tutelary of every individual Upon death an emperor could be made a state divinity divus by vote of the Senate The Roman imperial cult influenced by Hellenistic ruler cult became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult extending as far as Najran in presentday Saudi Arabia Rejection of the state religion became tantamount to treason The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honoured As the Romans extended their territories their general policy was to promote stability among diverse peoples by absorbing local deities and cults rather than eradicating them building temples that framed local theology within Roman religion Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the sidebyside worship of local and Roman deities including dedications made by Romans to local gods By the height of the Empire numerous syncretic or reinterpreted gods were cultivated among them cults of Cybele Isis Epona and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus found as far north as Roman Britain Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or cult only religious tolerance was not an issue Mystery religions which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife were a matter of personal choice practiced in addition to ones family rites and public religion The mysteries however involved exclusive oaths and secrecy which conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of magic conspiracy coniuratio and subversive activity Thus sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists In Gaul the power of the druids was checked first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order and then by banning druidism altogether However Celtic traditions were reinterpreted within the context of Imperial theology and a new GalloRoman religion coalesced its capital at the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls established precedent for Western cult as a form of Romanprovincial identity The monotheistic rigour of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and granting of special exemptions Tertullian noted that Judaism unlike Christianity was considered a religio licita legitimate religion The JewishRoman wars resulted from political as well as religious conflicts the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD led to the sacking of the temple and the dispersal of Jewish political power see Jewish diaspora Christianity emerged in Roman Judaea as a Jewish religious sect in the 1st century and gradually spread out of Jerusalem throughout the Empire and beyond Imperially authorized persecutions were limited and sporadic with martyrdoms occurring most often under the authority of local officials Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 the emperor attempted to deflect blame from himself onto the Christians A major persecution occurred under the emperor Domitian and a persecution in 177 took place at Lugdunum the GalloRoman religious capital A letter from Pliny the Younger governor of Bithynia describes his persecution and executions of Christians The Decian persecution of 246251 seriously threatened the Christian Church but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance Diocletian undertook the most severe persecution of Christians from 303 to 311 From the 2nd century onward the Church Fathers condemned the diverse religions practiced throughout the Empire as pagan In the early 4th century Constantine I became the first emperor to convert to Christianity He supported the Church financially and made laws that favored it but the new religion was already successful having moved from less than 50000 to over a million adherents between 150 and 250 Constantine and his successors banned public sacrifice while tolerating other traditional practices Constantine never engaged in a purge there were no pagan martyrs during his reign and people who had not converted to Christianity remained in important positions at court 302 Julian attempted to revive traditional public sacrifice and Hellenistic religion but met Christian resistance and lack of popular support Christians of the 4th century believed the conversion of Constantine showed that Christianity had triumphed over paganism in Heaven and little further action besides such rhetoric was necessary Thus their focus was heresy According to Peter Brown In most areas polytheists were not molested and apart from a few ugly incidents of local violence Jewish communities also enjoyed a century of stable even privileged existence 641643 There were antipagan laws but they were not generally enforced through the 6th century centers of paganism existed in Athens Gaza Alexandria and elsewhere According to recent Jewish scholarship toleration of the Jews was maintained under Christian emperors This did not extend to heretics Theodosius I made multiple laws and acted against alternate forms of Christianity and heretics were persecuted and killed by both the government and the church throughout Late Antiquity NonChristians were not persecuted until the 6th century Romes original religious hierarchy and ritual influenced Christian forms and many preChristian practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions Legacy Several states claimed to be the Roman Empires successor The Holy Roman Empire was established in 800 when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Roman emperor The Russian Tsardom as inheritor of the Byzantine Empires Orthodox Christian tradition counted itself the Third Rome Constantinople having been the second in accordance with the concept of translatio imperii The last Eastern Roman titular Andreas Palaiologos sold the title of Emperor of Constantinople to Charles VIII of France upon Charles death Palaiologos reclaimed the title and on his death granted it to Ferdinand and Isabella and their successors who never used it When the Ottomans who based their state on the Byzantine model took Constantinople in 1453 Mehmed II established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire He even launched an invasion of Otranto with the purpose of reuniting the Empire which was aborted by his death In the medieval West Roman came to mean the church and the Catholic Pope The Greek form Romaioi remained attached to the Greekspeaking Christian population of the Byzantine Empire and is still used by Greeks The Roman Empires control of the Italian Peninsula influenced Italian nationalism and the unification of Italy Risorgimento in 1861 In the United States

    title: "Periodic table",
    originalContent:
      "The periodic table also known as the periodic table of the elements is an ordered arrangement of the chemical elements into rows periods and columns groups It is an icon of chemistry and is widely used in physics and other sciences It is a depiction of the periodic law which states that when the elements are arranged in order of their atomic numbers an approximate recurrence of their properties is evident The table is divided into four roughly rectangular areas called blocks Elements in the same group tend to show similar chemical characteristics Vertical horizontal and diagonal trends characterize the periodic table Metallic character increases going down a group and from right to left across a period Nonmetallic character increases going from the bottom left of the periodic table to the top right The first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 he formulated the periodic law as a dependence of chemical properties on atomic mass As not all elements were then known there were gaps in his periodic table and Mendeleev successfully used the periodic law to predict some properties of some of the missing elements The periodic law was recognized as a fundamental discovery in the late 19th century It was explained early in the 20th century with the discovery of atomic numbers and associated pioneering work in quantum mechanics both ideas serving to illuminate the internal structure of the atom A recognisably modern form of the table was reached in 1945 with Glenn T Seaborgs discovery that the actinides were in fact fblock rather than dblock elements The periodic table and law are now a central and indispensable part of modern chemistry The periodic table continues to evolve with the progress of science In nature only elements up to atomic number 94 exist to go further it was necessary to synthesize new elements in the laboratory By 2010 the first 118 elements were known thereby completing the first seven rows of the table however chemical characterization is still needed for the heaviest elements to confirm that their properties match their positions New discoveries will extend the table beyond these seven rows though it is not yet known how many more elements are possible moreover theoretical calculations suggest that this unknown region will not follow the patterns of the known part of the table Some scientific discussion also continues regarding whether some elements are correctly positioned in todays table Many alternative representations of the periodic law exist and there is some discussion as to whether there is an optimal form of the periodic table Structure Each chemical element has a unique atomic number Z for Zahl German for number representing the number of protons in its nucleus Each distinct atomic number therefore corresponds to a class of atom these classes are called the chemical elements The chemical elements are what the periodic table classifies and organizes Hydrogen is the element with atomic number 1 helium atomic number 2 lithium atomic number 3 and so on Each of these names can be further abbreviated by a one or twoletter chemical symbol those for hydrogen helium and lithium are respectively H He and Li Neutrons do not affect the atoms chemical identity but do affect its weight Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes of the same chemical element Naturally occurring elements usually occur as mixes of different isotopes since each isotope usually occurs with a characteristic abundance naturally occurring elements have welldefined atomic weights defined as the average mass of a naturally occurring atom of that element All elements have multiple isotopes variants with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons For example carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well but about one per cent have seven neutrons and a very small fraction have eight neutrons Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table they are always grouped together under a single element When atomic mass is shown it is usually the weighted average of naturally occurring isotopes but if no isotopes occur naturally in significant quantities the mass of the most stable isotope usually appears often in parentheses In the standard periodic table the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number A new row period is started when a new electron shell has its first electron Columns groups are determined by the electron configuration of the atom elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns eg oxygen sulfur and selenium are in the same column because they all have four electrons in the outermost psubshell Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table although in the fblock and to some respect in the dblock the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties as well Thus it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it Today 118 elements are known the first 94 of which are known to occur naturally on Earth at present The remaining 24 americium to oganesson 95118 occur only when synthesized in laboratories Of the 94 naturally occurring elements 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements A few of the latter are so rare that they were not discovered in nature but were synthesized in the laboratory before it was determined that they do exist in nature after all technetium element 43 promethium element 61 astatine element 85 neptunium element 93 and plutonium element 94 No element heavier than einsteinium element 99 has ever been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form nor has astatine francium element 87 has been only photographed in the form of light emitted from microscopic quantities 300000 atoms Of the 94 natural elements eighty have a stable isotope and one more bismuth has an almoststable isotope with a halflife of 2011019 years over a billion times the age of the universe Two more thorium and uranium have isotopes undergoing radioactive decay with a halflife comparable to the age of the Earth The stable elements plus bismuth thorium and uranium make up the 83 primordial elements that survived from the Earths formation The remaining eleven natural elements decay quickly enough that their continued trace occurrence rests primarily on being constantly regenerated as intermediate products of the decay of thorium and uranium All 24 known artificial elements are radioactive Group names and numbers Under an international naming convention the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column the alkali metals to the rightmost column the noble gases The fblock groups are ignored in this numbering Groups can also be named by their first element eg the scandium group for group 3 Previously groups were known by Roman numerals In the United States the Roman numerals were followed by either an A if the group was in the s or pblock or a B if the group was in the dblock The Roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of todays naming convention eg the group 4 elements were group IVB and the group 14 elements were group IVA In Europe the lettering was similar except that A was used for groups 1 through 7 and B was used for groups 11 through 17 In addition groups 8 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triplesized group known collectively in both notations as group VIII In 1988 the new IUPAC International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry naming system 118 was put into use and the old group names IVIII were deprecated Presentation forms For reasons of space the periodic table is commonly presented with the fblock elements cut out and positioned as a distinct part below the main body This reduces the number of element columns from 32 to 18 Both forms represent the same periodic table The form with the fblock included in the main body is sometimes called the 32column or long form the form with the fblock cut out the 18column or mediumlong form The 32column form has the advantage of showing all elements in their correct sequence but it has the disadvantage of requiring more space The form chosen is an editorial choice and does not imply any change of scientific claim or statement For example when discussing the composition of group 3 the options can be shown equally unprejudiced in both forms Periodic tables usually at least show the elements symbols many also provide supplementary information about the elements either via colourcoding or as data in the cells The above table shows the names and atomic numbers of the elements and also their blocks natural occurrences and standard atomic weights For the shortlived elements without standard atomic weights the mass number of the most stable known isotope is used instead Other tables may include properties such as state of matter melting and boiling points densities as well as provide different classifications of the elements Electron configurations The periodic table is a graphic description of the periodic law which states that the properties and atomic structures of the chemical elements are a periodic function of their atomic number Elements are placed in the periodic table according to their electron configurations the periodic recurrences of which explain the trends in properties across the periodic table An electron can be thought of as inhabiting an atomic orbital which characterizes the probability it can be found in any particular region around the atom Their energies are quantised which is to say that they can only take discrete values Furthermore electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle different electrons must always be in different states This allows classification of the possible states an electron can take in various energy levels known as shells divided into individual subshells which each contain one or more orbitals Each orbital can contain up to two electrons they are distinguished by a quantity known as spin conventionally labelled up or down In a cold atom one in its ground state electrons arrange themselves in such a way that the total energy they have is minimized by occupying the lowestenergy orbitals available Only the outermost electrons socalled valence electrons have enough energy to break free of the nucleus and participate in chemical reactions with other atoms The others are called core electrons Elements are known with up to the first seven shells occupied The first shell contains only one orbital a spherical s orbital As it is in the first shell this is called the 1s orbital This can hold up to two electrons The second shell similarly contains a 2s orbital and it also contains three dumbbellshaped 2p orbitals and can thus fill up to eight electrons 21 23 8 The third shell contains one 3s orbital three 3p orbitals and five 3d orbitals and thus has a capacity of 21 23 25 18 The fourth shell contains one 4s orbital three 4p orbitals five 4d orbitals and seven 4f orbitals thus leading to a capacity of 21 23 25 27 32 Higher shells contain more types of orbitals that continue the pattern but such types of orbitals are not filled in the ground states of known elements The subshell types are characterized by the quantum numbers Four numbers describe an orbital in an atom completely the principal quantum number n the azimuthal quantum number the orbital type the orbital magnetic quantum number m and the spin magnetic quantum number ms Order of subshell filling The sequence in which the subshells are filled is given in most cases by the Aufbau principle also known as the Madelung or Klechkovsky rule after Erwin Madelung and Vsevolod Klechkovsky respectively This rule was first observed empirically by Madelung and Klechkovsky and later authors gave it theoretical justification The shells overlap in energies and the Madelung rule specifies the sequence of filling according to 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s 4f 5d 6p 7s 5f 6d 7p Here the sign means much less than as opposed to meaning just less than Phrased differently electrons enter orbitals in order of increasing n and if two orbitals are available with the same value of n the one with lower n is occupied first In general orbitals with the same value of n are similar in energy but in the case of the sorbitals with 0 quantum effects raise their energy to approach that of the next n group Hence the periodic table is usually drawn to begin each row often called a period with the filling of a new sorbital which corresponds to the beginning of a new shell Thus with the exception of the first row each period length appears twice 2 8 8 18 18 32 32 The overlaps get quite close at the point where the dorbitals enter the picture and the order can shift slightly with atomic number and atomic charge Starting from the simplest atom this lets us build up the periodic table one at a time in order of atomic number by considering the cases of single atoms In hydrogen there is only one electron which must go in the lowestenergy orbital 1s This electron configuration is written 1s1 where the superscript indicates the number of electrons in the subshell Helium adds a second electron which also goes into 1s completely filling the first shell and giving the configuration 1s2 Starting from the third element lithium the first shell is full so its third electron occupies a 2s orbital giving a 1s2 2s1 configuration The 2s electron is lithiums only valence electron as the 1s subshell is now too tightly bound to the nucleus to participate in chemical bonding to other atoms such a shell is called a core shell The 1s subshell is a core shell for all elements from lithium onward The 2s subshell is completed by the next element beryllium 1s2 2s2 The following elements then proceed to fill the 2p subshell Boron 1s2 2s2 2p1 puts its new electron in a 2p orbital carbon 1s2 2s2 2p2 fills a second 2p orbital and with nitrogen 1s2 2s2 2p3 all three 2p orbitals become singly occupied This is consistent with Hunds rule which states that atoms usually prefer to singly occupy each orbital of the same type before filling them with the second electron Oxygen 1s2 2s2 2p4 fluorine 1s2 2s2 2p5 and neon 1s2 2s2 2p6 then complete the already singly filled 2p orbitals the last of these fills the second shell completely Starting from element 11 sodium the second shell is full making the second shell a core shell for this and all heavier elements The eleventh electron begins the filling of the third shell by occupying a 3s orbital giving a configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1 for sodium This configuration is abbreviated Ne 3s1 where Ne represents neons configuration Magnesium Ne 3s2 finishes this 3s orbital and the following six elements aluminium silicon phosphorus sulfur chlorine and argon fill the three 3p orbitals Ne 3s2 3p1 through Ne 3s2 3p6 This creates an analogous series in which the outer shell structures of sodium through argon are analogous to those of lithium through neon and is the basis for the periodicity of chemical properties that the periodic table illustrates at regular but changing intervals of atomic numbers the properties of the chemical elements approximately repeat The first eighteen elements can thus be arranged as the start of a periodic table Elements in the same column have the same number of valence electrons and have analogous valence electron configurations these columns are called groups The single exception is helium which has two valence electrons like beryllium and magnesium but is typically placed in the column of neon and argon to emphasise that its outer shell is full Some contemporary authors question even this single exception preferring to consistently follow the valence configurations and place helium over beryllium There are eight columns in this periodic table fragment corresponding to at most eight outershell electrons A period begins when a new shell starts filling Finally the colouring illustrates the blocks the elements in the sblock coloured red are filling sorbitals while those in the pblock coloured yellow are filling porbitals Starting the next row for potassium and calcium the 4s subshell is the lowest in energy and therefore they fill it Potassium adds one electron to the 4s shell Ar 4s1 and calcium then completes it Ar 4s2 However starting from scandium Ar 3d1 4s2 the 3d subshell becomes the next highest in energy The 4s and 3d subshells have approximately the same energy and they compete for filling the electrons and so the occupation is not quite consistently filling the 3d orbitals one at a time The precise energy ordering of 3d and 4s changes along the row and also changes depending on how many electrons are removed from the atom For example due to the repulsion between the 3d electrons and the 4s ones at chromium the 4s energy level becomes slightly higher than 3d and so it becomes more profitable for a chromium atom to have a Ar 3d5 4s1 configuration than an Ar 3d4 4s2 one A similar anomaly occurs at copper whose atom has a Ar 3d10 4s1 configuration rather than the expected Ar 3d9 4s2 These are violations of the Madelung rule Such anomalies however do not have any chemical significance most chemistry is not about isolated gaseous atoms and the various configurations are so close in energy to each other that the presence of a nearby atom can shift the balance Therefore the periodic table ignores them and considers only idealized configurations At zinc Ar 3d10 4s2 the 3d orbitals are completely filled with a total of ten electrons Next come the 4p orbitals completing the row which are filled progressively by gallium Ar 3d10 4s2 4p1 through krypton Ar 3d10 4s2 4p6 in a manner analogous to the previous pblock elements From gallium onwards the 3d orbitals form part of the electronic core and no longer participate in chemistry The s and pblock elements which fill their outer shells are called maingroup elements the dblock elements coloured blue below which fill an inner shell are called transition elements or transition metals since they are all metals The next eighteen elements fill the 5s orbitals rubidium and strontium then 4d yttrium through cadmium again with a few anomalies along the way and then 5p indium through xenon Again from indium onward the 4d orbitals are in the core Hence the fifth row has the same structure as the fourth The sixth row of the table likewise starts with two sblock elements caesium and barium After this the first fblock elements coloured green below begin to appear starting with lanthanum These are sometimes termed inner transition elements As there are now not only 4f but also 5d and 6s subshells at similar energies competition occurs once again with many irregular configurations this resulted in some dispute about where exactly the fblock is supposed to begin but most who study the matter agree that it starts at lanthanum in accordance with the Aufbau principle Even though lanthanum does not itself fill the 4f subshell as a single atom because of repulsion between electrons its 4f orbitals are low enough in energy to participate in chemistry At ytterbium the seven 4f orbitals are completely filled with fourteen electrons thereafter a series of ten transition elements lutetium through mercury follows and finally six maingroup elements thallium through radon complete the period From lutetium onwards the 4f orbitals are in the core and from thallium onwards so are the 5d orbitals The seventh row is analogous to the sixth row 7s fills francium and radium then 5f actinium to nobelium then 6d lawrencium to copernicium and finally 7p nihonium to oganesson Starting from lawrencium the 5f orbitals are in the core and probably the 6d orbitals join the core starting from nihonium Again there are a few anomalies along the way for example as single atoms neither actinium nor thorium actually fills the 5f subshell and lawrencium does not fill the 6d shell but all these subshells can still become filled in chemical environments For a very long time the seventh row was incomplete as most of its elements do not occur in nature The missing elements beyond uranium started to be synthesized in the laboratory in 1940 when neptunium was made However the first element to be discovered by synthesis rather than in nature was technetium in 1937 The row was completed with the synthesis of tennessine in 2010 the last element oganesson had already been made in 2002 and the last elements in this seventh row were given names in 2016 This completes the modern periodic table with all seven rows completely filled to capacity Electron configuration table The following table shows the electron configuration of a neutral gasphase atom of each element Different configurations can be favoured in different chemical environments The maingroup elements have entirely regular electron configurations the transition and inner transition elements show twenty irregularities due to the aforementioned competition between subshells close in energy level For the last ten elements 109118 experimental data is lacking and therefore calculated configurations have been shown instead Completely filled subshells have been greyed out Variations Period 1 Although the modern periodic table is standard today the placement of the period 1 elements hydrogen and helium remains an open issue under discussion and some variation can be found Following their respective s1 and s2 electron configurations hydrogen would be placed in group 1 and helium would be placed in group 2 The group 1 placement of hydrogen is common but helium is almost always placed in group 18 with the other noble gases The debate has to do with conflicting understandings of the extent to which chemical or electronic properties should decide periodic table placement Like the group 1 metals hydrogen has one electron in its outermost shell and typically loses its only electron in chemical reactions Hydrogen has some metallike chemical properties being able to displace some metals from their salts But it forms a diatomic nonmetallic gas at standard conditions unlike the alkali metals which are reactive solid metals This and hydrogens formation of hydrides in which it gains an electron brings it close to the properties of the halogens which do the same though it is rarer for hydrogen to form H than H Moreover the lightest two halogens fluorine and chlorine are gaseous like hydrogen at standard conditions Some properties of hydrogen are not a good fit for either group hydrogen is neither highly oxidizing nor highly reducing and is not reactive with water Hydrogen thus has properties corresponding to both those of the alkali metals and the halogens but matches neither group perfectly and is thus difficult to place by its chemistry Therefore while the electronic placement of hydrogen in group 1 predominates some rarer arrangements show either hydrogen in group 17 duplicate hydrogen in both groups 1 and 17 or float it separately from all groups This last option has nonetheless been criticized by the chemist and philosopher of science Eric Scerri on the grounds that it appears to imply that hydrogen is above the periodic law altogether unlike all the other elements Helium is the only element that routinely occupies a position in the periodic table that is not consistent with its electronic structure It has two electrons in its outermost shell whereas the other noble gases have eight and it is an sblock element whereas all other noble gases are pblock elements However it is unreactive at standard conditions and has a full outer shell these properties are like the noble gases in group 18 but not at all like the reactive alkaline earth metals of group 2 For these reasons helium is nearly universally placed in group 18 which its properties best match a proposal to move helium to group 2 was rejected by IUPAC in 1988 for these reasons Nonetheless helium is still occasionally placed in group 2 today and some of its physical and chemical properties are closer to the group 2 elements and support the electronic placement Solid helium crystallises in a hexagonal closepacked structure which matches beryllium and magnesium in group 2 but not the other noble gases in group 18 Recent theoretical developments in noble gas chemistry in which helium is expected to show slightly less inertness than neon and to form HeOLiF2 with a structure similar to the analogous beryllium compound but with no expected neon analogue have resulted in more chemists advocating a placement of helium in group 2 This relates to the electronic argument as the reason for neons greater inertness is repulsion from its filled pshell that helium lacks though realistically it is unlikely that heliumcontaining molecules will be stable outside extreme lowtemperature conditions around 10 K The firstrow anomaly in the periodic table has additionally been cited to support moving helium to group 2 It arises because the first orbital of any type is unusually small since unlike its higher analogues it does not experience interelectronic repulsion from a smaller orbital of the same type This makes the first row of elements in each block unusually small and such elements tend to exhibit characteristic kinds of anomalies for their group Some chemists arguing for the repositioning of helium have pointed out that helium exhibits these anomalies if it is placed in group 2 but not if it is placed in group 18 on the other hand neon which would be the first group 18 element if helium was removed from that spot does exhibit those anomalies The relationship between helium and beryllium is then argued to resemble that between hydrogen and lithium a placement which is much more commonly accepted For example because of this trend in the sizes of orbitals a large difference in atomic radii between the first and second members of each main group is seen in groups 1 and 1317 it exists between neon and argon and between helium and beryllium but not between helium and neon This similarly affects the noble gases boiling points and solubilities in water where helium is too close to neon and the large difference characteristic between the first two elements of a group appears only between neon and argon Moving helium to group 2 makes this trend consistent in groups 2 and 18 as well by making helium the first group 2 element and neon the first group 18 element both exhibit the characteristic properties of a kainosymmetric first element of a group The group 18 placement of helium nonetheless remains nearuniversal due to its extreme inertness Additionally tables that float both hydrogen and helium outside all groups may rarely be encountered Group 3 In many periodic tables the fblock is shifted one element to the right so that lanthanum and actinium become dblock elements in group 3 and CeLu and ThLr form the fblock Thus the dblock is split into two very uneven portions This is a holdover from early mistaken measurements of electron configurations modern measurements are more consistent with the form with lutetium and lawrencium in group 3 and with LaYb and AcNo as the fblock The 4f shell is completely filled at ytterbium and for that reason Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz in 1948 considered it incorrect to group lutetium as an fblock element They did not yet take the step of removing lanthanum from the dblock as well but Jun Kond realized in 1963 that lanthanums lowtemperature superconductivity implied the activity of its 4f shell In 1965 David C Hamilton linked this observation to its position in the periodic table and argued that the fblock should be composed of the elements LaYb and AcNo Since then physical chemical and electronic evidence has supported this assignment The issue was brought to wide attention by William B Jensen in 1982 and the reassignment of lutetium and lawrencium to group 3 was supported by IUPAC reports dating from 1988 when the 118 group numbers were recommended and 2021 The variation nonetheless still exists because most textbook writers are not aware of the issue A third form can sometimes be encountered in which the spaces below yttrium in group 3 are left empty such as the table appearing on the IUPAC web site but this creates an inconsistency with quantum mechanics by making the fblock 15 elements wide LaLu and AcLr even though only 14 electrons can fit in an fsubshell There is moreover some confusion in the literature on which elements are then implied to be in group 3 While the 2021 IUPAC report noted that 15elementwide fblocks are supported by some practitioners of a specialized branch of relativistic quantum mechanics focusing on the properties of superheavy elements the projects opinion was that such interestdependent concerns should not have any bearing on how the periodic table is presented to the general chemical and scientific community Other authors focusing on superheavy elements since clarified that the 15th entry of the fblock represents the first slot of the dblock which is left vacant to indicate the place of the fblock inserts which would imply that this form still has lutetium and lawrencium the 15th entries in question as dblock elements in group 3 Indeed when IUPAC publications expand the table to 32 columns they make this clear and place lutetium and lawrencium under yttrium in group 3 Several arguments in favour of ScYLaAc can be encountered in the literature but they have been challenged as being logically inconsistent For example it has been argued that lanthanum and actinium cannot be fblock elements because as individual gasphase atoms they have not begun to fill the fsubshells But the same is true of thorium which is never disputed as an fblock element and this argument overlooks the problem on the other end that the fshells complete filling at ytterbium and nobelium matching the ScYLuLr form and not at lutetium and lawrencium as the ScYLaAc form would have it Not only are such exceptional configurations in the minority but they have also in any case never been considered as relevant for positioning any other elements on the periodic table in gaseous atoms the dshells complete their filling at copper palladium and gold but it is universally accepted by chemists that these configurations are exceptional and that the dblock really ends in accordance with the Madelung rule at zinc cadmium and mercury The relevant fact for placement is that lanthanum and actinium like thorium have valence forbitals that can become occupied in chemical environments whereas lutetium and lawrencium do not their fshells are in the core and cannot be used for chemical reactions Thus the relationship between yttrium and lanthanum is only a secondary relationship between elements with the same number of valence electrons but different kinds of valence orbitals such as that between chromium and uranium whereas the relationship between yttrium and lutetium is primary sharing both valence electron count and valence orbital type Periodic trends As chemical reactions involve the valence electrons elements with similar outer electron configurations may be expected to react similarly and form compounds with similar proportions of elements in them Such elements are placed in the same group and thus there tend to be clear similarities and trends in chemical behaviour as one proceeds down a group As analogous configurations occur at regular intervals the properties of the elements thus exhibit periodic recurrences hence the name of the periodic table and the periodic law These periodic recurrences were noticed well before the underlying theory that explains them was developed Atomic radius Historically the physical size of atoms was unknown until the early 20th century The first calculated estimate of the atomic radius of hydrogen was published by physicist Arthur Haas in 1910 to within an order of magnitude a factor of 10 of the accepted value the Bohr radius 0529 In his model Haas used a singleelectron configuration based on the classical atomic model proposed by J J Thomson in 1904 often called the plumpudding model Atomic radii the size of atoms are dependent on the sizes of their outermost orbitals They generally decrease going left to right along the maingroup elements because the nuclear charge increases but the outer electrons are still in the same shell However going down a column the radii generally increase because the outermost electrons are in higher shells that are thus further away from the nucleus The first row of each block is abnormally small due to an effect called kainosymmetry or primogenic repulsion the 1s 2p 3d and 4f subshells have no inner analogues For example the 2p orbitals do not experience strong repulsion from the 1s and 2s orbitals which have quite different angular charge distributions and hence are not very large but the 3p orbitals experience strong repulsion from the 2p orbitals which have similar angular charge distributions Thus higher s p d and fsubshells experience strong repulsion from their inner analogues which have approximately the same angular distribution of charge and must expand to avoid this This makes significant differences arise between the small 2p elements which prefer multiple bonding and the larger 3p and higher pelements which do not Similar anomalies arise for the 1s 2p 3d 4f and the hypothetical 5g elements the degree of this firstrow anomaly is highest for the sblock is moderate for the pblock and is less pronounced for the d and fblocks In the transition elements an inner shell is filling but the size of the atom is still determined by the outer electrons The increasing nuclear charge across the series and the increased number of inner electrons for shielding somewhat compensate each other so the decrease in radius is smaller The 4p and 5d atoms coming immediately after new types of transition series are first introduced are smaller than would have been expected because the added core 3d and 4f subshells provide only incomplete shielding of the nuclear charge for the outer electrons Hence for example gallium atoms are slightly smaller than aluminium atoms Together with kainosymmetry this results in an evenodd difference between the periods except in the sblock that is sometimes known as secondary periodicity elements in even periods have smaller atomic radii and prefer to lose fewer electrons while elements in odd periods except the first differ in the opposite direction Thus for example many properties in the pblock show a zigzag rather than a smooth trend along the group For example phosphorus and antimony in odd periods of group 15 readily reach the 5 oxidation state whereas nitrogen arsenic and bismuth in even periods prefer to stay at 3 A similar situation holds for the dblock with lutetium through tungsten atoms being slightly smaller than yttrium through molybdenum atoms respectively Thallium and lead atoms are about the same size as indium and tin atoms respectively but from bismuth to radon the 6p atoms are larger than the analogous 5p atoms This happens because when atomic nuclei become highly charged special relativity becomes needed to gauge the effect of the nucleus on the electron cloud These relativistic effects result in heavy elements increasingly having differing properties compared to their lighter homologues in the periodic table Spinorbit interaction splits the psubshell one porbital is relativistically stabilized and shrunken it fills in thallium and lead but the other two filling in bismuth through radon are relativistically destabilized and expanded Relativistic effects also explain why gold is golden and mercury is a liquid at room temperature They are expected to become very strong in the late seventh period potentially leading to a collapse of periodicity Electron configurations are only clearly known until element 108 hassium and experimental chemistry beyond 108 has only been done for elements 112 copernicium through 115 moscovium so the chemical characterization of the heaviest elements remains a topic of current research The trend that atomic radii decrease from left to right is also present in ionic radii though it is more difficult to examine because the most common ions of consecutive elements normally differ in charge Ions with the same electron configuration decrease in size as their atomic number rises due to increased attraction from the more positively charged nucleus thus for example ionic radii decrease in the series Se2 Br Rb Sr2 Y3 Zr4 Nb5 Mo6 Tc7 Ions of the same element get smaller as more electrons are removed because the attraction from the nucleus begins to outweigh the repulsion between electrons that causes electron clouds to expand thus for example ionic radii decrease in the series V2 V3 V4 V5 Ionisation energy The first ionisation energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from it This varies with the atomic radius ionisation energy increases left to right and down to up because electrons that are closer to the nucleus are held more tightly and are more difficult to remove Ionisation energy thus is minimized at the first element of each period hydrogen and the alkali metals and then generally rises until it reaches the noble gas at the right edge of the period There are some exceptions to this trend such as oxygen where the electron being removed is paired and thus interelectronic repulsion makes it easier to remove than expected In the transition series the outer electrons are preferentially lost even though the inner orbitals are filling For example in the 3d series the 4s electrons are lost first even though the 3d orbitals are being filled The shielding effect of adding an extra 3d electron approximately compensates the rise in nuclear charge and therefore the ionisation energies stay mostly constant though there is a small increase especially at the end of each transition series As metal atoms tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions ionisation energy is generally correlated with chemical reactivity although there are other factors involved as well Electron affinity The opposite property to ionisation energy is the electron affinity which is the energy released when adding an electron to the atom A passing electron will be more readily attracted to an atom if it feels the pull of the nucleus more strongly and especially if there is an available partially filled outer orbital that can accommodate it Therefore electron affinity tends to increase down to up and left to right The exception is the last column the noble gases which have a full shell and have no room for another electron This gives the halogens in the nexttolast column the highest electron affinities Some atoms like the noble gases have no electron affinity they cannot form stable gasphase anions They can form metastable resonances if the incoming electron arrives with enough kinetic energy but these inevitably and rapidly autodetach for example the lifetime of the most longlived He level is about 359 microseconds The noble gases having high ionisation energies and no electron affinity have little inclination towards gaining or losing electrons and are generally unreactive Some exceptions to the trends occur oxygen and fluorine have lower electron affinities than their heavier homologues sulfur and chlorine because they are small atoms and hence the newly added electron would experience significant repulsion from the already present ones For the nonmetallic elements electron affinity likewise somewhat correlates with reactivity but not perfectly since other factors are involved For example fluorine has a lower electron affinity than chlorine because of extreme interelectronic repulsion for the very small fluorine atom but is more reactive Valence and oxidation states The valence of an element can be defined either as the number of hydrogen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary hydride or as twice the number of oxygen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary oxide that is not a peroxide or a superoxide The valences of the maingroup elements are directly related to the group number the hydrides in the main groups 12 and 1317 follow the formulae MH MH2 MH3 MH4 MH3 MH2 and finally MH The highest oxides instead increase in valence following the formulae M2O MO M2O3 MO2 M2O5 MO3 M2O7 Today the notion of valence has been extended by that of the oxidation state which is the formal charge left on an element when all other elements in a compound have been removed as their ions The electron configuration suggests a ready explanation from the number of electrons available for bonding indeed the number of valence electrons starts at 1 in group 1 and then increases towards the right side of the periodic table only resetting at 3 whenever each new block starts Thus in period 6 CsBa have 12 valence electrons LaYb have 316 LuHg have 312 and TlRn have 38 However towards the right side of the d and fblocks the theoretical maximum corresponding to using all valence electrons is not achievable at all the same situation affects oxygen fluorine and the light noble gases up to krypton A full explanation requires considering the energy that would be released in forming compounds with different valences rather than simply considering electron configurations alone For example magnesium forms Mg2 rather than Mg cations when dissolved in water because the latter would spontaneously disproportionate into Mg0 and Mg2 cations This is because the enthalpy of hydration surrounding the cation with water molecules increases in magnitude with the charge and radius of the ion In Mg the outermost orbital which determines ionic radius is still 3s so the hydration enthalpy is small and insufficient to compensate the energy required to remove the electron but ionizing again to Mg2 uncovers the core 2p subshell making the hydration enthalpy large enough to allow magnesiumII compounds to form For similar reasons the common oxidation states of the heavier pblock elements where the ns electrons become lower in energy than the np tend to vary by steps of 2 because that is necessary to uncover an inner subshell and decrease the ionic radius eg Tl uncovers 6s and Tl3 uncovers 5d so once thallium loses two electrons it tends to lose the third one as well Analogous arguments based on orbital hybridization can be used for the less electronegative pblock elements For transition metals common oxidation states are nearly always at least 2 for similar reasons uncovering the next subshell this holds even for the metals with anomalous dx1s1 or dx2s0 configurations except for silver because repulsion between delectrons means that the movement of the second electron from the s to the dsubshell does not appreciably change its ionisation energy Because ionizing the transition metals further does not uncover any new inner subshells their oxidation states tend to vary by steps of 1 instead The lanthanides and late actinides generally show a stable 3 oxidation state removing the outer selectrons and then usually one electron from the n2forbitals that are similar in energy to ns The common and maximum oxidation states of the d and fblock elements tend to depend on the ionisation energies As the energy difference between the n1d and ns orbitals rises along each transition series it becomes less energetically favourable to ionize further electrons Thus the early transition metal groups tend to prefer higher oxidation states but the 2 oxidation state becomes more stable for the late transition metal groups The highest formal oxidation state thus increases from 3 at the beginning of each dblock row to 7 or 8 in the middle eg OsO4 and then decrease to 2 at the end The lanthanides and late actinides usually have high fourth ionisation energies and hence rarely surpass the 3 oxidation state whereas early actinides have low fourth ionisation energies and so for example neptunium and plutonium can reach 7 The very last actinides go further than the lanthanides towards low oxidation states mendelevium is more easily reduced to the 2 state than thulium or even europium the lanthanide with the most stable 2 state on account of its halffilled fshell and nobelium outright favours 2 over 3 in contrast to ytterbium As elements in the same group share the same valence configurations they usually exhibit similar chemical behaviour For example the alkali metals in the first group all have one valence electron and form a very homogeneous class of elements they are all soft and reactive metals However there are many factors involved and groups can often be rather heterogeneous For instance hydrogen also has one valence electron and is in the same group as the alkali metals but its chemical behaviour is quite different The stable elements of group 14 comprise a nonmetal carbon two semiconductors silicon and germanium and two metals tin and lead they are nonetheless united by having four valence electrons This often leads to similarities in maximum and minimum oxidation states eg sulfur and selenium in group 16 both have maximum oxidation state 6 as in SO3 and SeO3 and minimum oxidation state 2 as in sulfides and selenides but not always eg oxygen is not known to form oxidation state 6 despite being in the same group as sulfur and selenium Electronegativity Another important property of elements is their electronegativity Atoms can form covalent bonds to each other by sharing electrons in pairs creating an overlap of valence orbitals The degree to which each atom attracts the shared electron pair depends on the atoms electronegativity the tendency of an atom towards gaining or losing electrons The more electronegative atom will tend to attract the electron pair more and the less electronegative or more electropositive one will attract it less In extreme cases the electron can be thought of as having been passed completely from the more electropositive atom to the more electronegative one though this is a simplification The bond then binds two ions one positive having given up the electron and one negative having accepted it and is termed an ionic bond Electronegativity depends on how strongly the nucleus can attract an electron pair and so it exhibits a similar variation to the other properties already discussed electronegativity tends to fall going up to down and rise going left to right The alkali and alkaline earth metals are among the most electropositive elements while the chalcogens halogens and noble gases are among the most electronegative ones Electronegativity is generally measured on the Pauling scale on which the most electronegative reactive atom fluorine is given electronegativity 40 and the least electronegative atom caesium is given electronegativity 079 In fact neon is the most electronegative element but the Pauling scale cannot measure its electronegativity because it does not form covalent bonds with most elements An elements electronegativity varies with the identity and number of the atoms it is bonded to as well as how many electrons it has already lost an atom becomes more electronegative when it has lost more electrons This sometimes makes a large difference lead in the 2 oxidation state has electronegativity 187 on the Pauling scale while lead in the 4 oxidation state has electronegativity 233 Metallicity A simple substance is a substance formed from atoms of one chemical element The simple substances of the more electronegative atoms tend to share electrons form covalent bonds with each other They form either small molecules like hydrogen or oxygen whose atoms bond in pairs or giant structures stretching indefinitely like carbon or silicon The noble gases simply stay as single atoms as they already have a full shell Substances composed of discrete molecules or single atoms are held together by weaker attractive forces between the molecules such as the London dispersion force as electrons move within the molecules they create momentary imbalances of electrical charge which induce similar imbalances on nearby molecules and create synchronized movements of electrons across many neighbouring molecules The more electropositive atoms however tend to instead lose electrons creating a sea of electrons engulfing cations The outer orbitals of one atom overlap to share electrons with all its neighbours creating a giant structure of molecular orbitals extending over all the atoms This negatively charged sea pulls on all the ions and keeps them together in a metallic bond Elements forming such bonds are often called metals those which do not are often called nonmetals Some elements can form multiple simple substances with different structures these are called allotropes For example diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon The metallicity of an element can be predicted from electronic properties When atomic orbitals overlap during metallic or covalent bonding they create both bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals of equal capacity with the antibonding orbitals of higher energy Net bonding character occurs when there are more electrons in the bonding orbitals than there are in the antibonding orbitals Metallic bonding is thus possible when the number of electrons delocalized by each atom is less than twice the number of orbitals contributing to the overlap This is the situation for elements in groups 1 through 13 they also have too few valence electrons to form giant covalent structures where all atoms take equivalent positions and so almost all of them metallise The exceptions are hydrogen and boron which have too high an ionisation energy Hydrogen thus forms a covalent H2 molecule and boron forms a giant covalent structure based on icosahedral B12 clusters In a metal the bonding and antibonding orbitals have overlapping energies creating a single band that electrons can freely flow through allowing for electrical conduction In group 14 both metallic and covalent bonding become possible In a diamond crystal covalent bonds between carbon atoms are strong because they have a small atomic radius and thus the nucleus has more of a hold on the electrons Therefore the bonding orbitals that result are much lower in energy than the antibonding orbitals and there is no overlap so electrical conduction becomes impossible carbon is a nonmetal However covalent bonding becomes weaker for larger atoms and the energy gap between the bonding and antibonding orbitals decreases Therefore silicon and germanium have smaller band gaps and are semiconductors at ambient conditions electrons can cross the gap when thermally excited Boron is also a semiconductor at ambient conditions The band gap disappears in tin so that tin and lead become metals As the temperature rises all nonmetals develop some semiconducting properties to a greater or lesser extent depending on the size of the band gap Thus metals and nonmetals may be distinguished by the temperature dependence of their electrical conductivity a metals conductivity lowers as temperature rises because thermal motion makes it more difficult for the electrons to flow freely whereas a nonmetals conductivity rises as more electrons may be excited to cross the gap Elements in groups 15 through 17 have too many electrons to form giant covalent molecules that stretch in all three dimensions For the lighter elements the bonds in small diatomic molecules are so strong that a condensed phase is disfavoured thus nitrogen N2 oxygen O2 white phosphorus and yellow arsenic P4 and As4 sulfur and red selenium S8 and Se8 and the stable halogens F2 Cl2 Br2 and I2 readily form covalent molecules with few atoms The heavier ones tend to form long chains eg red phosphorus grey selenium tellurium or layered structures eg carbon as graphite black phosphorus grey arsenic antimony bismuth that only extend in one or two rather than three dimensions Both kinds of structures can be found as allotropes of phosphorus arsenic and selenium although the longchained allotropes are more stable in all three As these structures do not use all their orbitals for bonding they end up with bonding nonbonding and antibonding bands in order of increasing energy Similarly to group 14 the band gaps shrink for the heavier elements and free movement of electrons between the chains or layers becomes possible Thus for example black phosphorus black arsenic grey selenium tellurium and iodine are semiconductors grey arsenic antimony and bismuth are semimetals exhibiting quasimetallic conduction with a very small band overlap and polonium and probably astatine are true metals Finally the natural group 18 elements all stay as individual atoms The dividing line between metals and nonmetals is roughly diagonal from top left to bottom right with the transition series appearing to the left of this diagonal as they have many available orbitals for overlap This is expected as metallicity tends to be correlated with electropositivity and the willingness to lose electrons which increases right to left and up to down Thus the metals greatly outnumber the nonmetals Elements near the borderline are difficult to classify they tend to have properties that are intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals and may have some properties characteristic of both They are often termed semimetals or metalloids The term semimetal used in this sense should not be confused with its strict physical sense having to do with band structure bismuth is physically a semimetal but is generally considered a metal by chemists The following table considers the most stable allotropes at standard conditions The elements coloured yellow form simple substances that are wellcharacterised by metallic bonding Elements coloured light blue form giant network covalent structures whereas those coloured dark blue form small covalently bonded molecules that are held together by weaker van der Waals forces The noble gases are coloured in violet their molecules are single atoms and no covalent bonding occurs Greyedout cells are for elements which have not been prepared in sufficient quantities for their most stable allotropes to have been characterized in this way Theoretical considerations and current experimental evidence suggest that all of those elements would metallise if they could form condensed phases except perhaps for oganesson Generally metals are shiny and dense They usually have high melting and boiling points due to the strength of the metallic bond and are often malleable and ductile easily stretched and shaped because the atoms can move relative to each other without breaking the metallic bond They conduct electricity because their electrons are free to move in all three dimensions Similarly they conduct heat which is transferred by the electrons as extra kinetic energy they move faster These properties persist in the liquid state as although the crystal structure is destroyed on melting the atoms still touch and the metallic bond persists though it is weakened Metals tend to be reactive towards nonmetals Some exceptions can be found to these generalizations for example beryllium chromium manganese antimony bismuth and uranium are brittle not an exhaustive list chromium is extremely hard gallium rubidium caesium and mercury are liquid at or close to room temperature and noble metals such as gold are chemically very inert Nonmetals exhibit different properties Those forming giant covalent crystals exhibit high melting and boiling points as it takes considerable energy to overcome the strong covalent bonds Those forming discrete molecules are held together mostly by dispersion forces which are more easily overcome thus they tend to have lower melting and boiling points and many are liquids or gases at room temperature Nonmetals are often dulllooking They tend to be reactive towards metals except for the noble gases which are inert towards most substances They are brittle when solid as their atoms are held tightly in place They are less dense and conduct electricity poorly because there are no mobile electrons Near the borderline band gaps are small and thus many elements in that region are semiconductors such as silicon germanium and tellurium Selenium has both a semiconducting grey allotrope and an insulating red allotrope arsenic has a metallic grey allotrope a semiconducting black allotrope and an insulating yellow allotrope though the last is unstable at ambient conditions Again there are exceptions for example diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of all known materials greater than any metal It is common to designate a class of metalloids straddling the boundary between metals and nonmetals as elements in that region are intermediate in both physical and chemical properties However no consensus exists in the literature for precisely which elements should be so designated When such a category is used silicon germanium arsenic and tellurium are almost always included and boron and antimony usually are but most sources include other elements as well without agreement on which extra elements should be added and some others subtract from this list instead For example unlike all the other elements generally considered metalloids or nonmetals antimonys only stable form has metallic conductivity Moreover the element resembles bismuth and more generally the other pblock metals in its physical and chemical behaviour On this basis some authors have argued that it is better classified as a metal than as a metalloid On the other hand selenium has some semiconducting properties in its most stable form though it also has insulating allotropes and it has been argued that it should be considered a metalloid though this situation also holds for phosphorus which is a much rarer inclusion among the metalloids Further manifestations of periodicity There are some other relationships throughout the periodic table between elements that are not in the same group such as the diagonal relationships between elements that are diagonally adjacent eg lithium and magnesium Some similarities can also be found between the main groups and the transition metal groups or between the early actinides and early transition metals when the elements have the same number of valence electrons Thus uranium somewhat resembles chromium and tungsten in group 6 as all three have six valence electrons Relationships between elements with the same number of valence electrons but different types of valence orbital have been called secondary or isodonor relationships they usually have the same maximum oxidation states but not the same minimum oxidation states For example chlorine and manganese both have 7 as their maximum oxidation state eg Cl2O7 and Mn2O7 but their respective minimum oxidation states are 1 eg HCl and 3 K2MnCO4 Elements with the same number of valence vacancies but different numbers of valence electrons are related by a tertiary or isoacceptor relationship they usually have similar minimum but not maximum oxidation states For example hydrogen and chlorine both have 1 as their minimum oxidation state in hydrides and chlorides but hydrogens maximum oxidation state is 1 eg H2O while chlorines is 7 Many other physical properties of the elements exhibit periodic variation in accordance with the periodic law such as melting points boiling points heats of fusion heats of vaporization atomisation energy and so on Similar periodic variations appear for the compounds of the elements which can be observed by comparing hydrides oxides sulfides halides and so on Chemical properties are more difficult to describe quantitatively but likewise exhibit their own periodicities Examples include the variation in the acidic and basic properties of the elements and their compounds the stabilities of compounds and methods of isolating the elements Periodicity is and has been used very widely to predict the properties of unknown new elements and new compounds and is central to modern chemistry Classification of elements Many terms have been used in the literature to describe sets of elements that behave similarly The group names alkali metal alkaline earth metal triel tetrel pnictogen chalcogen halogen and noble gas are acknowledged by IUPAC the other groups can be referred to by their number or by their first element eg group 6 is the chromium group Some divide the pblock elements from groups 13 to 16 by metallicity although there is neither an IUPAC definition nor a precise consensus on exactly which elements should be considered metals nonmetals or semimetals sometimes called metalloids Neither is there a consensus on what the metals succeeding the transition metals ought to be called with posttransition metal and poor metal being among the possibilities having been used Some advanced monographs exclude the elements of group 12 from the transition metals on the grounds of their sometimes quite different chemical properties but this is not a universal practice and IUPAC does not presently mention it as allowable in its Principles of Chemical Nomenclature The lanthanides are considered to be the elements LaLu which are all very similar to each other historically they included only CeLu but lanthanum became included by common usage The rare earth elements or rare earth metals add scandium and yttrium to the lanthanides Analogously the actinides are considered to be the elements AcLr historically ThLr although variation of properties in this set is much greater than within the lanthanides IUPAC recommends the names lanthanoids and actinoids to avoid ambiguity as the ide suffix typically denotes a negative ion however lanthanides and actinides remain common With the increasing recognition of lutetium and lawrencium as dblock elements some authors began to define the lanthanides as LaYb and the actinides as AcNo matching the fblock The transactinides or superheavy elements are the shortlived elements beyond the actinides starting at lawrencium or rutherfordium depending on where the actinides are taken to end Many more categorizations exist and are used according to certain disciplines In astrophysics a metal is defined as any element with atomic number greater than 2 ie anything except hydrogen and helium The term semimetal has a different definition in physics than it does in chemistry bismuth is a semimetal by physical definitions but chemists generally consider it a metal A few terms are widely used but without any very formal definition such as heavy metal which has been given such a wide range of definitions that it has been criticized as effectively meaningless The scope of terms varies significantly between authors For example according to IUPAC the noble gases extend to include the whole group including the very radioactive superheavy element oganesson However among those who specialize in the superheavy elements this is not often done in this case noble gas is typically taken to imply the unreactive behaviour of the lighter elements of the group Since calculations generally predict that oganesson should not be particularly inert due to relativistic effects and may not even be a gas at room temperature if it could be produced in bulk its status as a noble gas is often questioned in this context Furthermore national variations are sometimes encountered in Japan alkaline earth metals often do not include beryllium and magnesium as their behaviour is different from the heavier group 2 metals History Early history In 1817 German physicist Johann Wolfgang Dbereiner began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements In 1829 he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three with the members of each group having related properties He termed these groups triads Chlorine bromine and iodine formed a triad as did calcium strontium and barium lithium sodium and potassium and sulfur selenium and tellurium Today all these triads form part of modernday groups the halogens alkaline earth metals alkali metals and chalcogens Various chemists continued his work and were able to identify more and more relationships between small groups of elements However they could not build one scheme that encompassed them all John Newlands published a letter in the Chemical News in February 1863 on the periodicity among the chemical elements In 1864 Newlands published an article in the Chemical News showing that if the elements are arranged in the order of their atomic weights those having consecutive numbers frequently either belong to the same group or occupy similar positions in different groups and he pointed out that each eighth element starting from a given one is in this arrangement a kind of repetition of the first like the eighth note of an octave in music The Law of Octaves However Newlandss formulation only worked well for the maingroup elements and encountered serious problems with the others German chemist Lothar Meyer noted the sequences of similar chemical and physical properties repeated at periodic intervals According to him if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates ie vertically and the atomic volumes as abscissas ie horizontallythe curve obtained a series of maximums and minimumsthe most electropositive elements would appear at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights In 1864 a book of his was published it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements and classified elements into six families by their valencefor the first time elements had been grouped according to their valence Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights In 1868 he revised his table but this revision was published as a draft only after his death Mendeleev The definitive breakthrough came from the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev Although other chemists including Meyer had found some other versions of the periodic system at about the same time Mendeleev was the most dedicated to developing and defending his system and it was his system that most affected the scientific community On 17 February 1869 1 March 1869 in the Gregorian calendar Mendeleev began arranging the elements and comparing them by their atomic weights He began with a few elements and over the course of the day his system grew until it encompassed most of the known elements After he found a consistent arrangement his printed table appeared in May 1869 in the journal of the Russian Chemical Society When elements did not appear to fit in the system he boldly predicted that either valencies or atomic weights had been measured incorrectly or that there was a missing element yet to be discovered In 1871 Mendeleev published a long article including an updated form of his table that made his predictions for unknown elements explicit Mendeleev predicted the properties of three of these unknown elements in detail as they would be missing heavier homologues of boron aluminium and silicon he named them ekaboron ekaaluminium and ekasilicon eka being Sanskrit for one 45 In 1875 the French chemist Paulmile Lecoq de Boisbaudran working without knowledge of Mendeleevs prediction discovered a new element in a sample of the mineral sphalerite and named it gallium He isolated the element and began determining its properties Mendeleev reading de Boisbaudrans publication sent a letter claiming that gallium was his predicted ekaaluminium Although Lecoq de Boisbaudran was initially sceptical and suspected that Mendeleev was trying to take credit for his discovery he later admitted that Mendeleev was correct In 1879 the Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson discovered a new element which he named scandium it turned out to be ekaboron Ekasilicon was found in 1886 by German chemist Clemens Winkler who named it germanium The properties of gallium scandium and germanium matched what Mendeleev had predicted In 1889 Mendeleev noted at the Faraday Lecture to the Royal Institution in London that he had not expected to live long enough to mention their discovery to the Chemical Society of Great Britain as a confirmation of the exactitude and generality of the periodic law Even the discovery of the noble gases at the close of the 19th century which Mendeleev had not predicted fitted neatly into his scheme as an eighth main group Mendeleev nevertheless had some trouble fitting the known lanthanides into his scheme as they did not exhibit the periodic change in valencies that the other elements did After much investigation the Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner suggested in 1902 that the lanthanides could all be placed together in one group on the periodic table He named this the asteroid hypothesis as an astronomical analogy just as there is an asteroid belt instead of a single planet between Mars and Jupiter so the place below yttrium was thought to be occupied by all the lanthanides instead of just one element Atomic number After the internal structure of the atom was probed amateur Dutch physicist Antonius van den Broek proposed in 1913 that the nuclear charge determined the placement of elements in the periodic table The New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford coined the word atomic number for this nuclear charge In van den Broeks published article he illustrated the first electronic periodic table showing the elements arranged according to the number of their electrons Rutherford confirmed in his 1914 paper that Bohr had accepted the view of van den Broek The same year English physicist Henry Moseley using Xray spectroscopy confirmed van den Broeks proposal experimentally Moseley determined the value of the nuclear charge of each element from aluminium to gold and showed that Mendeleevs ordering actually places the elements in sequential order by nuclear charge Nuclear charge is identical to proton count and determines the value of the atomic number Z of each element Using atomic number gives a definitive integerbased sequence for the elements Moseleys research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties these were cases such as tellurium and iodine where atomic number increases but atomic weight decreases Although Moseley was soon killed in World War I the Swedish physicist Manne Siegbahn continued his work up to uranium and established that it was the element with the highest atomic number then known 92 Based on Moseley and Siegbahns research it was also known which atomic numbers corresponded to missing elements yet to be found 43 61 72 75 85 and 87 Element 75 had in fact already been found by Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa in 1908 and named nipponium but he mistakenly assigned it as element 43 instead of 75 and so his discovery was not generally recognized until later The contemporarily accepted discovery of element 75 came in 1925 when Walter Noddack Ida Tacke and Otto Berg independently rediscovered it and gave it its present name rhenium The dawn of atomic physics also clarified the situation of isotopes In the decay chains of the primordial radioactive elements thorium and uranium it soon became evident that there were many apparent new elements that had different atomic weights but exactly the same chemical properties In 1913 Frederick Soddy coined the term isotope to describe this situation and considered isotopes to merely be different forms of the same chemical element This furthermore clarified discrepancies such as tellurium and iodine telluriums natural isotopic composition is weighted towards heavier isotopes than iodines but tellurium has a lower atomic number Electron shells The Danish physicist Niels Bohr applied Max Plancks idea of quantization to the atom He concluded that the energy levels of electrons were quantised only a discrete set of stable energy states were allowed Bohr then attempted to understand periodicity through electron configurations surmising in 1913 that the inner electrons should be responsible for the chemical properties of the element In 1913 he produced the first electronic periodic table based on a quantum atom Bohr called his electron shells rings in 1913 atomic orbitals within shells did not exist at the time of his planetary model Bohr explains in Part 3 of his famous 1913 paper that the maximum electrons in a shell is eight writing We see further that a ring of n electrons cannot rotate in a single ring round a nucleus of charge ne unless n 8 For smaller atoms the electron shells would be filled as follows rings of electrons will only join if they contain equal numbers of electrons and that accordingly the numbers of electrons on inner rings will only be 2 4 8 However in larger atoms the innermost shell would contain eight electrons on the other hand the periodic system of the elements strongly suggests that already in neon N 10 an inner ring of eight electrons will occur His proposed electron configurations for the atoms shown to the right mostly do not accord with those now known They were improved further after the work of Arnold Sommerfeld and Edmund Stoner discovered more quantum numbers The first one to systematically expand and correct the chemical potentials of Bohrs atomic theory was Walther Kossel in 1914 and in 1916 Kossel explained that in the periodic table new elements would be created as electrons were added to the outer shell In Kossels paper he writes This leads to the conclusion that the electrons which are added further should be put into concentric rings or shells on each of which only a certain number of electronsnamely eight in our caseshould be arranged As soon as one ring or shell is completed a new one has to be started for the next element the number of electrons which are most easily accessible and lie at the outermost periphery increases again from element to element and therefore in the formation of each new shell the chemical periodicity is repeated In a 1919 paper Irving Langmuir postulated the existence of cells which we now call orbitals which could each only contain two electrons each and these were arranged in equidistant layers which we now call shells He made an exception for the first shell to only contain two electrons The chemist Charles Rugeley Bury suggested in 1921 that eight and eighteen electrons in a shell form stable configurations Bury proposed that the electron configurations in transitional elements depended upon the valence electrons in their outer shell He introduced the word transition to describe the elements now known as transition metals or transition elements Bohrs theory was vindicated by the discovery of element 72 Georges Urbain claimed to have discovered it as the rare earth element celtium but Bury and Bohr had predicted that element 72 could not be a rare earth element and had to be a homologue of zirconium Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy searched for the element in zirconium ores and found element 72 which they named hafnium after Bohrs hometown of Copenhagen Hafnia in Latin Urbains celtium proved to be simply purified lutetium element 71 Hafnium and rhenium thus became the last stable elements to be discovered Prompted by Bohr Wolfgang Pauli took up the problem of electron configurations in 1923 Pauli extended Bohrs scheme to use four quantum numbers and formulated his exclusion principle which stated that no two electrons could have the same four quantum numbers This explained the lengths of the periods in the periodic table 2 8 18 and 32 which corresponded to the number of electrons that each shell could occupy In 1925 Friedrich Hund arrived at configurations close to the modern ones As a result of these advances periodicity became based on the number of chemically active or valence electrons rather than by the valences of the elements The Aufbau principle that describes the electron configurations of the elements was first empirically observed by Erwin Madelung in 1926 though the first to publish it was Vladimir Karapetoff in 1930 In 1961 Vsevolod Klechkovsky derived the first part of the Madelung rule that orbitals fill in order of increasing n from the ThomasFermi model the complete rule was derived from a similar potential in 1971 by Yury N Demkov and Valentin N Ostrovsky The quantum theory clarified the transition metals and lanthanides as forming their own separate groups transitional between the main groups although some chemists had already proposed tables showing them this way before then the English chemist Henry Bassett did so in 1892 the Danish chemist Julius Thomsen in 1895 and the Swiss chemist Alfred Werner in 1905 Bohr used Thomsens form in his 1922 Nobel Lecture Werners form is very similar to the modern 32column form In particular this supplanted Brauners asteroidal hypothesis The exact position of the lanthanides and thus the composition of group 3 remained under dispute for decades longer because their electron configurations were initially measured incorrectly On chemical grounds Bassett Werner and Bury grouped scandium and yttrium with lutetium rather than lanthanum the former two left an empty space below yttrium as lutetium had not yet been discovered Hund assumed in 1927 that all the lanthanide atoms had configuration Xe4f0145d16s2 on account of their prevailing trivalency It is now known that the relationship between chemistry and electron configuration is more complicated than that Early spectroscopic evidence seemed to confirm these configurations and thus the periodic table was structured to have group 3 as scandium yttrium lanthanum and actinium with fourteen felements breaking up the dblock between lanthanum and hafnium But it was later discovered that this is only true for four of the fifteen lanthanides lanthanum cerium gadolinium and lutetium and that the other lanthanide atoms do not have a delectron In particular ytterbium completes the 4f shell and thus Soviet physicists Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz noted in 1948 that lutetium is correctly regarded as a dblock rather than an fblock element that bulk lanthanum is an fmetal was first suggested by Jun Kond in 1963 on the grounds of its lowtemperature superconductivity This clarified the importance of looking at lowlying excited states of atoms that can play a role in chemical environments when classifying elements by block and positioning them on the table Many authors subsequently rediscovered this correction based on physical chemical and electronic concerns and applied it to all the relevant elements thus making group 3 contain scandium yttrium lutetium and lawrencium and having lanthanum through ytterbium and actinium through nobelium as the fblock rows this corrected version achieves consistency with the Madelung rule and vindicates Bassett Werner and Burys initial chemical placement In 1988 IUPAC released a report supporting this composition of group 3 a decision that was reaffirmed in 2021 Variation can still be found in textbooks on the composition of group 3 and some argumentation against this format is still published today but chemists and physicists who have considered the matter largely agree on group 3 containing scandium yttrium lutetium and lawrencium and challenge the counterarguments as being inconsistent Synthetic elements By 1936 the pool of missing elements from hydrogen to uranium had shrunk to four elements 43 61 85 and 87 remained missing Element 43 eventually became the first element to be synthesized artificially via nuclear reactions rather than discovered in nature It was discovered in 1937 by Italian chemists Emilio Segr and Carlo Perrier who named their discovery technetium after the Greek word for artificial Elements 61 promethium and 85 astatine were likewise produced artificially in 1945 and 1940 respectively element 87 francium became the last element to be discovered in nature by French chemist Marguerite Perey in 1939 The elements beyond uranium were likewise discovered artificially starting with Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelsons 1940 discovery of neptunium via bombardment of uranium with neutrons Glenn T Seaborg and his team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory LBNL continued discovering transuranium elements starting with plutonium in 1941 and discovered that contrary to previous thinking the elements from actinium onwards were congeners of the lanthanides rather than transition metals Bassett 1892 Werner 1905 and the French engineer Charles Janet 1928 had previously suggested this but their ideas did not then receive general acceptance Seaborg thus called them the actinides Elements up to 101 named mendelevium in honour of Mendeleev were synthesized up to 1955 either through neutron or alphaparticle irradiation or in nuclear explosions in the cases of 99 einsteinium and 100 fermium A significant controversy arose with elements 102 through 106 in the 1960s and 1970s as competition arose between the LBNL team now led by Albert Ghiorso and a team of Soviet scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research JINR led by Georgy Flyorov Each team claimed discovery and in some cases each proposed their own name for the element creating an element naming controversy that lasted decades These elements were made by bombardment of actinides with light ions IUPAC at first adopted a handsoff approach preferring to wait and see if a consensus would be forthcoming But as it was also the height of the Cold War it became clear that this would not happen As such IUPAC and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics IUPAP created a Transfermium Working Group TWG fermium being element 100 in 1985 to set out criteria for discovery which were published in 1991 After some further controversy these elements received their final names in 1997 including seaborgium 106 in honour of Seaborg The TWGs criteria were used to arbitrate later element discovery claims from LBNL and JINR as well as from research institutes in Germany GSI and Japan Riken Currently consideration of discovery claims is performed by a IUPACIUPAP Joint Working Party After priority was assigned the elements were officially added to the periodic table and the discoverers were invited to propose their names By 2016 this had occurred for all elements up to 118 therefore completing the periodic tables first seven rows The discoveries of elements beyond 106 were made possible by techniques devised by Yuri Oganessian at the JINR cold fusion bombardment of lead and bismuth by heavy ions made possible the 19812004 discoveries of elements 107 through 112 at GSI and 113 at Riken and he led the JINR team in collaboration with American scientists to discover elements 114 through 118 using hot fusion bombardment of actinides by calcium ions in 19982010 The heaviest known element oganesson 118 is named in Oganessians honour Element 114 is named flerovium in honour of his predecessor and mentor Flyorov In celebration of the periodic tables 150th anniversary the United Nations declared the year 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table celebrating one of the most significant achievements in science The discovery criteria set down by the TWG were updated in 2020 in response to experimental and theoretical progress that had not been foreseen in 1991 Today the periodic table is among the most recognisable icons of chemistry IUPAC is involved today with many processes relating to the periodic table the recognition and naming of new elements recommending group numbers and collective names and the updating of atomic weights Future extension beyond the seventh period The most recently named elements nihonium 113 moscovium 115 tennessine 117 and oganesson 118 completed the seventh row of the periodic table Future elements would have to begin an eighth row These elements may be referred to either by their atomic numbers eg element 164 or by the IUPAC systematic element names adopted in 1978 which directly relate to the atomic numbers eg unhexquadium for element 164 derived from Latin unus one Greek hexa six Latin quadra four and the traditional ium suffix for metallic elements All attempts to synthesize such elements have failed so far An attempt to make element 119 has been ongoing since 2018 at the Riken research institute in Japan The LBNL in the United States the JINR in Russia and the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou HIRFL in China also plan to make their own attempts at synthesizing the first few period 8 elements If the eighth period followed the pattern set by the earlier periods then it would contain fifty elements filling the 8s 5g 6f 7d and finally 8p subshells in that order But by this point relativistic effects should result in significant deviations from the Madelung rule Various different models have been suggested for the configurations of eighthperiod elements as well as how to show the results in a periodic table All agree that the eighth period should begin like the previous ones with two 8s elements 119 and 120 However after that the massive energetic overlaps between the 5g 6f 7d and 8p subshells means that they all begin to fill together and it is not clear how to separate out specific 5g and 6f series Elements 121 through 156 thus do not fit well as chemical analogues of any previous group in the earlier parts of the table although they have sometimes been placed as 5g 6f and other series to formally reflect their electron configurations Eric Scerri has raised the question of whether an extended periodic table should take into account the failure of the Madelung rule in this region or if such exceptions should be ignored The shell structure may also be fairly formal at this point already the electron distribution in an oganesson atom is expected to be rather uniform with no discernible shell structure The situation from elements 157 to 172 should return to normalcy and be more reminiscent of the earlier rows The heavy pshells are split by the spinorbit interaction one porbital p12 is more stabilized and the other two p32 are destabilized Such shifts in the quantum numbers happen for all types of shells but it makes the biggest difference to the order for the pshells It is likely that by element 157 the filled 8s and 8p12 shells with four electrons in total have sunk into the core Beyond the core the next orbitals are 7d and 9s at similar energies followed by 9p12 and 8p32 at similar energies and then a large gap Thus the 9s and 9p12 orbitals in essence replace the 8s and 8p12 ones making elements 157172 probably chemically analogous to groups 318 for example element 164 would appear two places below lead in group 14 under the usual pattern but is calculated to be very analogous to palladium in group 10 instead Thus it takes fiftyfour elements rather than fifty to reach the next noble element after 118 However while these conclusions about elements 157 through 172s chemistry are generally agreed by models there is disagreement on whether the periodic table should be drawn to reflect chemical analogies or if it should reflect likely formal electron configurations which should be quite different from earlier periods and are not agreed between sources Discussion about the format of the eighth row thus continues Beyond element 172 calculation is complicated by the 1s electron energy level becoming imaginary Such a situation does have a physical interpretation and does not in itself pose an electronic limit to the periodic table but the correct way to incorporate such states into multielectron calculations is still an open question needing to be solved to calculate the periodic tables structure beyond this point Nuclear stability will likely prove a decisive factor constraining the number of possible elements It depends on the balance between the electric repulsion between protons and the strong force binding protons and neutrons together Protons and neutrons are arranged in shells just like electrons and so a closed shell can significantly increase stability the known superheavy nuclei exist because of such a shell closure probably at around 114126 protons and 184 neutrons They are probably close to a predicted island of stability where superheavy nuclides should be more longlived than expected predictions for the longestlived nuclides on the island range from microseconds to millions of years It should nonetheless be noted that these are essentially extrapolations into an unknown part of the chart of nuclides and systematic model uncertainties need to be taken into account As the closed shells are passed the stabilizing effect should vanish Thus superheavy nuclides with more than 184 neutrons are expected to have much shorter lifetimes spontaneously fissioning within 1015 seconds If this is so then it would not make sense to consider them chemical elements IUPAC defines an element to exist only if the nucleus lives longer than 1014 seconds the time needed for it to gather an electron cloud Nonetheless theoretical estimates of halflives are very modeldependent ranging over many orders of magnitude The extreme repulsion between protons is predicted to result in exotic nuclear topologies with bubbles rings and tori expected this further complicates extrapolation It is not clear if any furtherout shell closures exist due to an expected smearing out of distinct nuclear shells as is already expected for the electron shells at oganesson Furthermore even if later shell closures exist it is not clear if they would allow such heavy elements to exist As such it may be that the periodic table practically ends around element 120 as elements become too shortlived to observe and then too shortlived to have chemistry the era of discovering new elements would thus be close to its end If another proton shell closure beyond 126 does exist then it probably occurs around 164 thus the region where periodicity fails more or less matches the region of instability between the shell closures Alternatively quark matter may become stable at high mass numbers in which the nucleus is composed of freely flowing up and down quarks instead of binding them into protons and neutrons this would create a continent of stability instead of an island Other effects may come into play for example in very heavy elements the 1s electrons are likely to spend a significant amount of time so close to the nucleus that they are actually inside it which would make them vulnerable to electron capture Even if eighthrow elements can exist producing them is likely to be difficult and it should become even more difficult as atomic number rises Although the 8s elements 119 and 120 are expected to be reachable with present means the elements beyond that are expected to require new technology if they can be produced at all Experimentally characterizing these elements chemically would also pose a great challenge Alternative periodic tables The periodic law may be represented in multiple ways of which the standard periodic table is only one Within 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleevs table in 1869 Edward G Mazurs had collected an estimated 700 different published versions of the periodic table Many forms retain the rectangular structure including Charles Janets leftstep periodic table pictured below and the modernised form of Mendeleevs original 8column layout that is still common in Russia Other periodic table formats have been shaped much more exotically such as spirals Otto Theodor Benfeys pictured to the right circles and triangles Alternative periodic tables are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables with different ones skewed more towards emphasizing chemistry or physics at either end The standard form which remains by far the most common is somewhere in the middle The many different forms of the periodic table have prompted the questions of whether there is an optimal or definitive form of the periodic table and if so what it might be There are no current consensus answers to either question Janets leftstep table is being increasingly discussed as a candidate for being the optimal or most fundamental form Scerri has written in support of it as it clarifies heliums nature as an sblock element increases regularity by having all period lengths repeated faithfully follows Madelungs rule by making each period correspond to one value of n and regularises atomic number triads and the firstrow anomaly trend While he notes that its placement of helium atop the alkaline earth metals can be seen a disadvantage from a chemical perspective he counters this by appealing to the firstrow anomaly pointing out that the periodic table fundamentally reduces to quantum mechanics and that it is concerned with abstract elements and hence atomic properties rather than macroscopic properties See also Nucleosynthesis Notes References Bibliography Further reading External links Periodic Table featured topic page on

    title: "Apple Inc.",
    originalContent:
      "Apple Inc is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered and incorporated in Cupertino California in Silicon Valley It is best known for its consumer electronics software and services Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer Inc the following year It was renamed Apple Inc in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics Apple is the largest technology company by revenue with US39104 billion in FY 2024 The company was founded to produce and market Wozniaks Apple I personal computer Its second computer the Apple II became a best seller as one of the first massproduced microcomputers Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984 as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse By 1985 internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT Inc and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures John Sculley served as longtime CEO for over a decade In the 1990s Apple lost considerable market share in the personal computer industry to the lowerpriced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intelpowered PC clones In 1997 Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy To resolve its failed operating system strategy it bought NeXT effectively bringing Jobs back to the company who guided Apple back to profitability over the next decade with the introductions of the iMac iPod iPhone and iPad devices to critical acclaim as well as the iTunes Store launching the Think different advertising campaign and opening the Apple Store retail chain These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the worlds most valuable brands since about 2010 Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons and died two months later he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook Apples current product lineup includes portable and home hardware such as the iPhone iPad Apple Watch Mac and Apple TV operating systems such as iOS iPadOS and macOS and various software and services including Apple Pay iCloud and multimedia streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV Apple is one of the Big Five American information technology companies for the most part since 2011 Apple has been the worlds largest company by market capitalization and as of 2023 is the largest manufacturing company by revenue the fourthlargest personal computer vendor by unit sales the largest vendor of tablet computers and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world Apple became the first publicly traded US company to be valued at over 1 trillion in 2018 and as of June 2024 is valued at just over 32 trillion Apple has received criticism regarding its contractors labor practices its relationship with trade unions its environmental practices and its business ethics including anticompetitive practices and materials sourcing Nevertheless the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty History 19761980 Founding and incorporation Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1 1976 by Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne as a partnership The companys first product is the Apple I a computer designed and handbuilt entirely by Wozniak To finance its creation Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus and Wozniak sold his HP65 calculator 57 Neither received the full selling price but in total earned 1300 equivalent to 7000 in 2023 Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976 The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU RAM and basic textualvideo chipsa base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer It was priced soon after debut for 66666 equivalent to 3600 in 2023 180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666 and that he came up with the price because he liked repeating digits Apple Computer Inc was incorporated in Cupertino California on January 3 1977 without Wayne who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for 800 only twelve days after having cofounded it Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of 250000 equivalent to 1257000 in 2023 to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple During the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially doubling about every four months Between September 1977 and September 1980 yearly sales grew from 775000 to US118 million an average annual growth rate of 533 The Apple II also designed by Wozniak was introduced on April 16 1977 at the first West Coast Computer Faire It differs from its major rivals the TRS80 and Commodore PET because of its character cellbased color graphics and open architecture The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices which were superseded by the 514inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978 The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer application of the business world VisiCalc a spreadsheet program released in 1979 VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II compatibility with the office but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari Commodore and Tandy On December 12 1980 Apple ticker symbol AAPL went public selling 46 million shares at 22 per share 10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3 2022 generating over 100 million which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956 By the end of the day around 300 millionaires were created including Jobs and Wozniak from a stock price of 29 per share and a market cap of 1778 billion 19801990 Success with Macintosh In December 1979 Steve Jobs and Apple employees including Jef Raskin visited Xerox PARC where they observed the Xerox Alto featuring a graphical user interface GUI Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARCs technology leading to Apples option to buy shares at a preferential rate This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apples products starting with the Apple Lisa Despite being pioneering as a massmarketed GUI computer the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options leading to commercial failure Jobs angered by being pushed off the Lisa team took over the companys Macintosh division Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a lowcost computer with a textbased interface like the Apple II but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa undercutting his former division Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division which at the time generated most of the companys revenue In 1984 Apple launched the Macintosh the first personal computer without a bundled programming language Its debut was signified by 1984 a US15 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22 1984 This was hailed as a watershed event for Apples success and was called a masterpiece by CNN and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide The advertisement created great interest in Macintosh and sales were initially good but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of 1000 equivalent to 2900 in 2023 The Macintosh shipped for 2495 equivalent to 7300 in 2023 a price panned by critics due to its slow performance 195 In early 1985 this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs saying Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products Rather than submit to Sculleys direction Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership JeanLouis Gasse informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apples executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures expressing his frustration with Apples treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had been going in the wrong direction for the last five years Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative receiving a stipend estimated to be 120000 per year Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders following their departures After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985 Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM and introduced the LaserWriter the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer PageMaker an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985 It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh LaserWriter and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market This dominant position in the desktop publishing market allowed the company to focus on higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mid1980s due to JeanLouis Gasses slogan of fiftyfive or die referring to the 55 profit margins of the Macintosh II 7980 This policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the companys history to have declining sales which led to a 20 drop in Apples stock price 117129 During this period the relationship between Sculley and Gasse deteriorated leading Sculley to effectively demote Gasse in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer Gasse left the company later that year to set up a rival Be Inc 19901997 Decline and restructuring The company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lowercost models the Macintosh Classic the Macintosh LC and the Macintosh IIsi all of which generated significant sales due to pentup demand In 1991 Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops The same year Apple introduced System 7 a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities The success of the lowercost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue For some time Apple was doing very well introducing fresh new products at increasing profits The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the first golden age of the Macintosh The success of lowercost consumer Macs especially the LC cannibalized higherpriced machines To address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points for different markets the highend Quadra series the midrange Centris series and the consumermarketed Performa series This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models In 1993 the Apple II series was discontinued It was expensive to produce and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lowercost Macintosh models After the launch of the LC Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993 Apple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s including QuickTake digital cameras PowerCD portable CD audio players speakers the Pippin video game console the eWorld online service and Apple Interactive Television Box Enormous resources were invested in the problematic Newton tablet division based on John Sculleys unrealistic market forecasts Throughout this period Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the Lisa in Apple Computer Inc v Microsoft Corp The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apples reputation and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler Under Spindler Apple IBM and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 to create a new computing platform the PowerPC Reference Platform or PReP with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software The AIM alliance hoped that PRePs performance and Apples software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows That year Apple introduced the Power Macintosh the first of many computers with Motorolas PowerPC processor In the wake of the alliance Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones Over the next two years 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced However by 1996 Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own highend computers where profit margins were highest In 1996 Spindler was replaced as CEO by Gil Amelio who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator Amelio made deep changes including extensive layoffs and costcutting This period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system MacOS The original Macintosh operating system System 1 was not built for multitasking running several applications at once The company attempted to correct this by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5 but still decided it needed a more modern approach This led to the Pink project in 1988 AUX that same year Copland in 1994 and evaluated the purchase of BeOS in 1996 Talks with Be stalled when the CEO former Apple executive JeanLouis Gasse demanded 300 million in contrast to Apples 125 million offer Only weeks away from bankruptcy Apples board preferred NeXTSTEP and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for 400 million retaining Steve Jobs 19972007 Return to profitability The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9 1997 and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor On July 9 1997 Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelios resignation after overseeing a threeyear recordlow stock price and crippling financial losses The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup Jobs canceled 70 of models ending 3000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings The next month in August 1997 Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a 150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software This was seen as an antitrust insurance policy for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anticompetitive practices in the United States v Microsoft Corp case Around then Jobs donated Apples internal library and archives to Stanford University to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past He ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997 purchased the largest clone maker Power Computing On November 10 1997 the Apple Store website launched which was tied to a new buildtoorder manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer Dells success The moves paid off for Jobs at the end of his first year as CEO the company had a 309 million profit On May 6 1998 Apple introduced a new allinone computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh the iMac The iMac was a huge success with 800000 units sold in its first five months and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 312inch diskette being an early adopter of the USB connector and coming preinstalled with Internet connectivity the i in iMac via Ethernet and a dialup modem Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by Jonathan Ive who had been hired by Amelio and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apples product design A little more than a year later on July 21 1999 Apple introduced the iBook consumer laptop It culminated Jobss strategy to produce only four products refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation Around then Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers Apple acquired Macromedias Key Grip digital video editing software project which was launched as Final Cut Pro in April 1999 Key Grips development also led to Apples release of the consumer videoediting product iMovie in October 1999 Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000 which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector which Apple repackaged as the professionaloriented DVD Studio Pro and reused its technology to create iDVD for the consumer market In 2000 Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady Greene Apple renamed the program iTunes and simplified the user interface and added CD burning In 2001 Apple changed course with three announcements First on March 24 2001 Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system Mac OS X This was after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s and several years of development Mac OS X is based on NeXTSTEP OpenStep and BSD Unix to combine the stability reliability and security of Unix with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface Second in May 2001 the first two Apple Store retail locations opened in Virginia and California offering an improved presentation of the companys products At the time many speculated that the stores would fail but they became highly successful and the first of more than 500 stores around the world Third on October 23 2001 the iPod portable digital audio player debuted The product was first sold on November 10 2001 and was extremely successful with over 100 million units sold within six years In 2003 the iTunes Store was introduced with music downloads for 99 a song and iPod integration It quickly became the market leader in online music services with over 5 billion downloads by June 19 2008 Two years later the iTunes Store was the worlds largest music retailer In 2002 Apple purchased Nothing Real for its advanced digital compositing application Shake and Emagic for the music productivity application Logic The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company The acquisition was followed by the development of Apples consumerlevel GarageBand application The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite At the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6 2005 Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006 On January 10 2006 the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intels Core Duo CPU By August 7 2006 Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product lineover one year sooner than announced The Power Mac iBook and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition the Mac Pro MacBook and MacBook Pro became their respective successors Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X Apples success during this period was evident in its stock price Between early 2003 and 2006 the price of Apples stock increased more than tenfold from around 6 per share splitadjusted to over 80 When Apple surpassed Dells market cap in January 2006 Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dells CEO Michael Dell should eat his words Nine years prior Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders 20072011 Success with mobile devices During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007 Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer Inc to Apple Inc because the company had broadened its focus from computers to consumer

to as a tribute to Alan Turing with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide On August 27 1999 Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation An Aquathemed version of the monochrome logo was used from 1998 until 2003 and a glassthemed version was used from 2007 until 2013 Apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism

the late 1970s From 1997 to 2002 the slogan Think different was used in advertising campaigns and is still closely associated with Apple Apple also has slogans for specific product linesfor example iThink therefore iMac was used in 1998 to promote the iMac and Say hello to iPhone has been used in iPhone advertisements Hello was also used to introduce the original Macintosh Newton iMac hello again and iPod From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts Apple has been recognized for its efforts toward effective advertising and marketing for its products However claims made by later campaigns were criticized particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads Apples product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eyepopping graphics and catchy tunes Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song 1234 and Yael Nam with the song New Soul Stores The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by thenCEO Steve Jobs after years of attempting but failing storewithinastore concepts Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the companys products he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000 Jobs relaunched Apples online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001 The media initially speculated that Apple would fail but its stores were highly successful bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US1 billion in annual sales becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so Over the years Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017 Strong product sales have placed Apple among the toptier retail stores with sales over 16 billion globally in 2011 Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign beginning in May 2016 This redesign included physical changes to the Apple

built several standalone flagship stores in highprofile locations It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores designs and construction specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers who have lost traffic control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores Due to the popularity of the brand Apple receives a large number of job applications many of which come from young workers Although Apple Store employees receive aboveaverage pay are offered money toward education and health care and receive product discounts there are limited or no paths of career advancement Market power On March 16 2020 France fined Apple 11 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market According to the French regulators the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller eBizcuss in 2012 On August 13 2020 Epic Games the maker of the popular game Fortnite sued both Apple and Google after Fortnite was removed from Apples and Googles

founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores Later in December 2020 Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic Facebook had however stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021 In the months prior to their agreement Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps and privacy rule changes Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented saying that this is not really about privacy for them this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences its going to have on smallbusiness owners commenting on the fullpage ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020 Privacy Apple has publicly taken a proprivacy stance actively making privacyconscious features and settings part of its conferences promotional campaigns and public image With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014 the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users passcodes making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the users local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apples iCloud storage system It also introduced differential privacy a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users while keeping individual users anonymous in a system that Wired described as trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate and can actively optin or optout However Apple has aided law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users devices and the companys commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States With Apples release of an update to iOS 14 Apple required all developers of iPhone iPad and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them The feature called App Tracking Transparency received heavy criticism from Facebook whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads a technique commonly known as targeted advertising After Facebooks measures including purchasing fullpage newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency Apple released the update in early 2021 A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4 of iOS users in the United States and 12 worldwide have opted into tracking Prior to the release of iOS 15 Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs Additionally ondevice hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement if enough matches were found Apple would be alerted and authorities informed The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates However privacy advocates including the Electronic Frontier Foundation condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments Irelands Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EUs GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform In December 2019 security researcher Brian Krebs discovered that the iPhone 11 Pro would still show the arrow indicator signifying location services are being used at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled despite all individual location services being disabled Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment he was told by Apple that It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings Apple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with ultrawideband regulations in specific countries a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone 11 Pro and emphasized that the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data Will Strafach an executive at security firm Guardian Firewall confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the devices location According to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30 2022 Apple turned over data such as phone numbers physical addresses and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials When asked about the allegations an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines which stated We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse Corporate affairs Business trends The key trends for Apple are as of each financial year

162115200 shares 105 Corporate culture Apple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company By the time of the 1984 television advertisement Apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors According to a 2011 report in Fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation In a 2017 interview Wozniak credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions in his youth as inspiration for cofounding Apple As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives some media have suggested that it has lost some of its original character Nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after Jobs returned Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobss involvement often took longer than others The Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing Recipients include Bill Atkinson Steve Capps Rod Holt Alan Kay Guy Kawasaki Al Alcorn Don Norman Rich Page Steve Wozniak and Phil Schiller Jobs intended that employees were to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise For instance Ron JohnsonSenior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1 2011was responsible for site selection instore service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores This was done by Tim Cook who had a background in supplychain management Apple

July 2022 Apple reported an 11 decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021 Its revenue in the same period rose 2 yearonyear to 83 billion though this figure was also lower than in 2021 where the increase was at 36 The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China That year Apple was one of the largest corporate spenders on research and development worldwide with RD expenditure amounting to over 27 billion In May 2023 Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023 Compared to that of 2022 revenue for 2023 fell by 3 This is Apples second consecutive quarter of sales decline This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing However iPhone sales held up with a yearonyear increase of 15 According to Apple demands for such devices were strong particularly in Latin America and South Asia Taxes Apple has created subsidiaries in lowtax places such as Ireland the Netherlands Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world According to The New York Times in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in hightax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of lowtax subsidiaries on other continents sidestepping income taxes In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30 2012 which showed that some multinational companies including Apple Inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent well below standard corporate tax rates He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals which also included Google and The CocaCola Company to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax According to a US Senate report on the companys offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013 Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure The main subsidiary a holding company that includes Apples retail stores throughout Europe has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and US tax residency rules the report said On May 21 2013 Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his companys tax tactics at a Senate hearing Apple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the US with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26 as of Q2 FY2016 In an interview with the German newspaper FAZ in October 2017 Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide In 2016 after a twoyear investigation the European Commission claimed that Apples use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted illegal state aid from Ireland and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros 145 billion in unpaid taxes the largest corporate tax fine in history This was later annulled after the European General Court ruled that the commission had provided insufficient evidence In 2018 Apple repatriated 285 billion to America resulting in a 38 billion tax payment spread over the following eight years Charity Apple is a partner of Product Red a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity In November 2014 Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a twoweek period to go to the fundraiser generating more than US20 million and in March 2017 it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish Apple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters In November 2012 it donated 25 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy and in 2017 it donated 5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey and for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake The company has used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake the 2011 Japan earthquake Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013 and the 2015 European migrant crisis Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations sending 100 of the payments directly to relief efforts though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible On April 14 2016 Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF announced that they have engaged in a partnership to help protect life on our planet Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store Apps for Earth In the arrangement Apple has committed that through April 24 WWF will receive 100 of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the InApp Purchases Apple and WWFs Apps for Earth campaign raised more than 8 million in total proceeds to support WWFs conservation work WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco During the COVID19 pandemic Apples CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating millions of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe On January 13 2021 Apple announced a 100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to help combat institutional racism worldwide after the 2020 murder

California and Nevada have been declared to provide 2179 megawatts of solar generation capacity Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina to use the methane emissions to generate electricity Apples North Carolina data center is already powered entirely by renewable sources Energy and resources In 2010 Climate Counts a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100 which puts Apple in their top category Striding This was an increase from May 2008 when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100 which placed the company last among electronics companies at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a stuck icon adding that Apple at the time was a choice to avoid for the climateconscious consumer Following a Greenpeace protest Apple released a statement on April 17 2012 committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100 renewable clean energy By 2013 Apple was using 100 renewable energy to power their data centers Overall 75 of the companys power came from clean renewable sources In May 2015 Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying Apples commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100 renewable Internet is within its reach and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet As of 2016 Apple states that 100 of its US operations run on renewable energy 100 of Apples data centers run on renewable energy and 93 of Apples global operations run on renewable energy However the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool EPEAT allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment Each product receives a Gold Silver or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability Every Apple tablet notebook desktop computer and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating the highest possible Although Apples data centers recycle water 35 times the increased activity in retail corporate and data centers also increase the amount of

recycled paper or sustainably managed forests as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products Apple announced on August 16 2016 that Lens Technology one of its major suppliers in China has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018 The commitment is a large step in Apples efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with ULs Zero Waste to Landfill validation The standard which started in January 2015 certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused recycled composted or converted into energy when necessary Since the program began nearly 140000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills On July 21 2020 Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business manufacturing supply chain and product life cycle by 2030 In the next 10 years Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions including low carbon product design expanding energy efficiency renewable energy process and material innovations and carbon removal In June 2024 the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA published a report about an electronic computer manufacturing facility leased by Apple in 2015 in Santa Clara California code named Aria The EPA report stated that Apple was potentially in violation of federal regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA According to a report from Bloomberg in 2018 the facility is used to develop microLED screens under the code name T159 The inspection found that Apple was potentially mistreating waste as only subject to California regulations and that they had potentially miscalculated the effectiveness of Apples activated carbon filters which filter volatile organic compounds VOCs from the air The EPA inspected the facility in August 2023 due to a tip from a former Apple employee who posted the report on X Toxins Following further campaigns by Greenpeace in 2008 Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride PVC and brominated flame retardants BFRs in its complete product line In June 2007 Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp CCFL backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercuryfree LEDbacklit LCD displays and arsenicfree glass starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e emissions materials and electrical usage

featured in Greenpeaces Guide to Greener Electronics which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability climate and energy policy and how green their products are The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies moving up five places from the previous year with a score of 4610 Greenpeace praised Apples sustainability noting that the company exceeded its 70 global recycling goal in 2010 Apple continues to score well on product ratings with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs However the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions In January 2012 Apple requested that its cable maker Volex begin producing halogenfree USB and power cables Green bonds In February 2016 Apple issued a US15 billion green bond climate bond the first ever of its kind by a US tech company The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects Supply chain Apple products were made in America in Appleowned factories until the late 1990s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad According to a report by The New York Times Apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that Made in the USA is no longer a viable option for most Apple products The companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profitsapping inventories In 2011 Apples profit margins were 40 percent compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies Cooks catchphrase to describe his focus on the companys operational arm is Nobody wants to buy sour milk In May 2017 the company announced a 1 billion funding project for advanced manufacturing in the United States and subsequently invested 200 million in Corning Inc a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in Apples iPhones The following December Apples chief operating officer Jeff Williams told CNBC that the 1 billion amount was absolutely not the final limit on its spending elaborating that Were not thinking in terms of a fund limit Were thinking about where are the opportunities across the US to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that that quite frankly is essential to our innovation During the Macs early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with Apples adoption of the PCI bus in the 750085009500 Power Macs Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB AGP HyperTransport WiFi NVMe PCIe and others in its products FireWire is an Appleoriginated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all cable TV boxes in the United States Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market In July 2012 during a conference call with investors CEO Tim Cook said that he loves India but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region Indias requirement that 30 of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as really adds cost to getting product to market In May 2016 Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4000 staff in Hyderabad In March The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India over the next two months and in May the Journal wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of the iPhone SE in the country while Apple told CNBC that the manufacturing was for a small number of units In April 2019 Apple initiated manufacturing of the iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India At the beginning of 2020 Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021 while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year The opening of the Apple Store was postponed and finally took place in April 2023 while the online store was launched in September 2020 Worker organizations Apple directly employs 147000 workers including 25000 corporate employees in Apple Park and across Silicon Valley The vast majority of its employees work at the over 500 retail Apple Stores globally Apple relies on a larger outsourced workforce for manufacturing particularly in China where Apple directly employs 10000 workers across its retail and corporate divisions In addition one further million workers are contracted by Apples suppliers to assemble Apple products including Foxconn and Pegatron Zhengzhou Technology Park alone employs 350000 Chinese workers in Zhengzhou to exclusively work on the iPhone As of 2021 Apple uses hardware components from 43 different countries The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design

controversies over content such as fake news conspiracy theories copyright infringement and hate speech Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers History The history of Facebook traces its growth from a college networking site to a global social networking service Zuckerberg built a website called Facemash in 2003 while attending Harvard University The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used photos from online face books asking users to choose the hotter person Zuckerberg was reported and faced expulsion but the charges were dropped A face book is a student directory featuring photos and personal information In January 2004 Zuckerberg coded a new site known as TheFacebook stating It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available the benefits are many Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin and each agreed to invest 1000 On February 4 2004 Zuckerberg launched TheFacebook Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College Dustin Moskovitz Andrew McCollum and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the site It became available successively to most universities in the US and Canada In mid2004 Napster cofounder Sean Parker became company president and the company moved to Palo Alto California PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel gave Facebook its first investment In 2005 the company dropped the from its name after purchasing the domain name Facebookcom In 2006 Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address Facebook introduced key features like the News Feed which became central to user engagement By late 2007 Facebook had 100000 pages on which companies promoted themselves Facebook had surpassed MySpace in global traffic and became the worlds most popular social media platform Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 16 share of Facebook for 240 million 353 million in 2023 dollars giving Facebook an implied value of around 15 billion 22 billion in 2023 dollars Facebook focused on generating revenue through targeted advertising based on user data a model that drove its rapid financial growth In 2012 Facebook went public with one of the largest IPOs in tech history Acquisitions played a significant role in Facebooks dominance In 2012 it purchased Instagram followed by WhatsApp and Oculus VR in 2014 extending its influence beyond social networking into messaging and virtual reality The FacebookCambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 revealed misuse of user data to influence elections sparking global outcry and leading to regulatory fines and hearings Facebooks role in global events including its use in organizing movements like the Arab Spring and its impact on events like the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar highlighted its dual nature as a tool for empowerment and harm In 2021 Facebook rebranded as Meta reflecting its shift toward building the metaverse and focusing on virtual reality and augmented reality technologies Features Facebook posts can have an unlimited number of characters with images and videos Users can friend users both sides must agree to being friends Posts can be changed to be seen by everyone public friends people in a certain group group or by selected friends private Users can join groups Groups are composed of persons with shared interests For example they might go to the same sporting club live in the same suburb have the same breed of pet or share a hobby Posts posted in a group can be seen only by those in a group unless set to public Users can buy sell or swap things on Facebook Marketplace or in a Buy Swap and Sell group Facebook users can advertise events which can be offline on a website other than Facebook or on Facebook Website Technical aspects The sites primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is redgreen colorblind a realization that occurred after a test taken around 2007 Facebook was initially built using PHP a popular scripting language designed for web development PHP was used to create dynamic content and manage data on the server side of the Facebook application Zuckerberg and cofounders chose PHP for its simplicity and ease of use which allowed them to quickly develop and deploy the initial version of Facebook As Facebook grew in user base and functionality the company encountered scalability and performance challenges with PHP In response Facebook engineers developed tools and technologies to optimize PHP performance One of the most significant was the creation of the HipHop Virtual Machine HHVM This significantly improved the performance and efficiency of PHP code execution on Facebooks servers The site started switching from HTTP to HTTPS in January 2011 2012 architecture Facebook is developed as one monolithic application According to an interview in 2012 with Facebook build engineer Chuck Rossi Facebook compiles into a 15 GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrentbased release system Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers The build and release process has zero downtime Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily Facebook used a combination platform based on HBase to store data across distributed machines Using a tailing architecture events are stored in log files and the logs are tailed The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users Facebook handles requests as AJAX behavior These requests are written to a log file using Scribe developed by Facebook Data is read from these log files using Ptail an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores It tails the log files and pulls data out Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different data centers Plugin impression News feed impressions Actions plugin news feed Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow InputOutput or IO Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews Batches are taken every 15 seconds limited by memory used when creating a hash table Data is then output in PHP format The backend is written in Java Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services Caching solutions display pages more quickly The data is then sent to MapReduce servers where it is queried via Hive This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive Content delivery network CDN Facebook uses its own content delivery network or edge network under the domain fbcdnnet for serving static data Until the mid2010s Facebook also relied on Akamai for CDN services Hack programming language On March 20 2014 Facebook announced a new opensource programming language called Hack Before public release a large portion of Facebook was already running and battle tested using the new language User profilepersonal timeline Each registered user on Facebook has a personal profile that shows their posts and content The format of individual user pages was revamped in September 2011 and became known as Timeline a chronological feed of a

disclosed by other users on their profiles If a user does not provide key information such as location hometown or relationship status other users can use a new ask button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click News Feed News Feed appears on every users homepage and highlights information including profile changes upcoming events and friends birthdays This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause Initially the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities such as relationship status changes events and conversations with other users Zuckerberg apologized for the sites failure to include appropriate privacy features Users then gained control over what types of information are shared automatically with friends Users are now able to prevent userset categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities including profile changes Wall posts and newly added friends On February 23 2010 Facebook was granted a patent on certain aspects of its News Feed The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the activity of another user The sorting and display of stories in a users News Feed is governed by the EdgeRank algorithm The Photos application allows users to upload albums and photos Each album can contain 200 photos Privacy settings apply to individual albums Users can tag or label friends in a photo The friend receives a notification about the tag with a link to the photo

companies such as The Guardian and Financial Times In March and April 2021 in response to Apple announcing changes to its iOS devices Identifier for Advertisers policy which included requiring app developers to directly request to users the ability to track on an optin basis Facebook purchased fullpage newspaper advertisements attempting to convince users to allow tracking highlighting the effects targeted ads have on small businesses Facebooks efforts were ultimately unsuccessful as Apple released iOS 145 in late April 2021 containing the feature for users in what has been deemed App Tracking Transparency Moreover statistics from Verizon Communications subsidiary Flurry Analytics show 96 of all iOS users in the United States are not permitting tracking at all and only 12 of worldwide iOS users are allowing tracking which some news outlets deem Facebooks nightmare among similar terms Despite the news Facebook has stated that the new policy and software update would be manageable Like button The like button stylized as a thumbs up icon was first enabled on February 9 2009 and enables users to easily interact with status updates comments photos and videos links

Facebook buys data from third parties gathered from both online and offline sources to supplement its own data on users Facebook maintains that it does not share data used for targeted advertising with the advertisers themselves The company states We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing but we dont share information that personally identifies you information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are unless you give us permission For example we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers for example that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering to help them better understand their audience We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser As of October 2021 Facebook claims it uses the following policy for sharing user data with third parties Apps websites and thirdparty integrations on or using our Products When you choose to use thirdparty apps websites or other services that use or are integrated with our Products they can receive information about what you post or share For example when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook Also when you download or use such thirdparty services they can access your public profile on Facebook and any information that you share with them Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you or information about any of your Instagram followers although your friends and followers may of course choose to share this information themselves Information collected by these thirdparty services is subject to their own terms and policies not this one Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram ie where we have not developed our own firstparty apps will have access to all information you choose to share with them including information your friends share with you so they can provide our core functionality to you Note We are in the process of restricting developers data access even further to help prevent abuse For example we will remove developers access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you havent used their app in 3 months and we are changing Login so that in the next version we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name Instagram username and bio profile photo and email address Requesting any other data will require our approval Facebook will also share data

evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised Facebooks privacy problems resulted in companies like Viber Media and Mozilla discontinuing advertising on Facebooks platforms A January 2024 study by

the Operational Manager at Facebook as of March 2021 accused the firm of discriminating against Black people The EEOC has initiated an investigation into the case Shadow profiles A shadow profile refers to the data Facebook collects about individuals without their explicit permission For example the like button that appears on thirdparty websites allows the company to collect information about an individuals internet browsing habits even if the individual is not a Facebook user Data can also be collected by other users For example a Facebook user can link their email account to their Facebook to find friends on the site allowing the company to collect the email addresses of users and nonusers alike Over time countless data points about an individual are collected any single data point perhaps cannot identify an individual but together allows the company to form a unique profile This practice has been criticized by those who believe people should be able to optout of involuntary data collection Additionally while Facebook users have the ability to download and inspect the data they provide to the site data from the users shadow profile is not included and nonusers of Facebook do not have access to this tool regardless The company has also been unclear whether or not it is possible for a person to revoke Facebooks access to their shadow profile Cambridge Analytica Facebook customer Global Science Research sold information on over 87 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica a political data analysis firm led by Alexander Nix While approximately 270000 people used the app Facebooks API permitted data collection from their friends without their knowledge At first Facebook downplayed the significance of the breach and suggested that Cambridge Analytica no longer had access Facebook then issued a statement expressing alarm and suspended Cambridge Analytica Review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica still possessed the data This was a violation of Facebooks consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission This violation potentially carried a penalty of 40000 48534 in 2023 dollars per occurrence totalling trillions of dollars According to The Guardian both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story After publication

a breach of trust You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014 This was a breach of trust and Im sorry we didnt do more at the time Were now taking steps to make sure this doesnt happen again Weve already stopped apps like this from getting so much information Now were limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook Were also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this We expect there are others And when we find them we will ban them and tell everyone affected Finally well remind you which apps youve given access to your information so you can shut off the ones you dont want anymore Thank you for believing in this community I promise to do better for you On March 26 the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into the matter The controversy led Facebook to end its partnerships with data brokers who aid advertisers in targeting users

information they collected Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy Facebook also implemented additional privacy controls and settings in part to comply with the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which took effect in May Facebook also ended its active opposition to the California Consumer Privacy Act Some such as Meghan McCain have drawn an equivalence between the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and the Barack Obamas 2012 campaign which according to Investors Business Daily encouraged supporters to download an Obama 2012 Facebook app that when activated let the campaign collect Facebook data both on users and their friends Carol Davidsen the Obama for America OFA former director of integration and media analytics wrote that Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph but they didnt stop us once they realised that was what we were doing PolitiFact has rated McCains statements HalfTrue on the basis that in Obamas case direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign whereas with Cambridge Analytica users thought they were only taking a personality quiz for academic purposes and while the Obama campaign only used the data to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends Cambridge Analytica targeted users friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads DataSpii In July 2019 cybersecurity researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as DataSpii involving data provider DDMR and marketing intelligence company Nacho Analytics NA Branding itself as the God mode for the internet NA through DDMR provided its members access to private Facebook photos and Facebook Messenger attachments including tax returns DataSpii harvested data from millions of Chrome and Firefox users through compromised browser extensions The NA website stated it collected data from millions of optin users Jadali along with journalists from Ars Technica and The Washington Post interviewed impacted users including a Washington Post staff member According to the interviews the impacted users did not consent to such collection DataSpii demonstrated how a compromised user exposed the data of others including the private photos and Messenger attachments belonging to a Facebook users network of friends DataSpii exploited Facebooks practice of making private photos and Messenger attachments publicly accessible via unique URLs To bolster security in this regard Facebook appends query strings in the URLs so as to limit the period of accessibility Nevertheless NA provided realtime access to these unique URLs which were intended to be secure This allowed NA members to access the private content within the restricted time frame designated by Facebook The Washington Posts Geoffrey Fowler in collaboration with Jadali opened Fowlers private Facebook photo in a browser with a compromised browser extension Within minutes they anonymously retrieved the private photo To validate this proofofconcept they searched for Fowlers name using NA which yielded his photo as a search result In addition Jadali discovered Fowlers Washington Post colleague Nick Mourtoupalas was directly impacted by DataSpii Jadalis investigation elucidated how DataSpii disseminated private data to additional thirdparties including foreign entities within minutes of the data being acquired In doing so he identified the thirdparties who were scraping storing and potentially enabling the facialrecognition of individuals in photos being furnished by DataSpii Breaches On

company deployed 147 gigawatthours of battery energy storage products an increase of 125 over 2022 but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 megawatts a decrease of 36 over 2022 Tesla Energy products include solar panels built by other companies for Tesla the Tesla Solar Roof a solar shingle system and the Tesla Solar Inverter Storage products include the Powerwall a home energy storage device and the Megapack a largescale energy storage system For largescale customers Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated realtime power trading demand forecasting and product control In March 2021 the company said its online products were managing over 12 GWh of storage For home customers the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric which utilizes the companys online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high earning money for customers Business strategy At the time of Teslas founding in 2003 electric vehicles were costly In 2006 Elon Musk stated that Teslas strategy was to first produce highprice lowvolume vehicles such as sports cars for which customers are less sensitive to price This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars Teslas first vehicle the Roadster was lowvolume fewer than 2500 were produced and priced at over 100000 The next models the Model S and Model X are more affordable but still luxury vehicles The Model 3 and the Model Y are priced still lower and aimed at a higher volume market selling over 100000 vehicles each quarter Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year unlike nearly every other car manufacturer Unlike other automakers Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles Instead the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of companyowned stores The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers Some jurisdictions particularly in the United States prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers In these areas Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says educate and inform customers about our products but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles In total Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts inside shopping malls or other hightraffic areas instead of near other auto dealerships Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components inhouse such as batteries motors and software The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry where companies typically outsource 80 of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the worlds use of sustainable energy Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla or to copy its designs directly Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology On April 15 2024 Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips marking a significant step in Teslas expansion into Indias automotive market On May 2 2024 Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for nextgeneration gigacasting a cuttingedge manufacturing technique Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces This strategic shift reflects the companys focus on selfdriving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges Technology Tesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components inhouse such as batteries motors and software Batteries As of 2023 Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors 18650 2170 4680 and prismatic Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers CATL LG Energy Solution and Panasonic the latter of which has colocated some of its battery production inside Teslas Gigafactory Nevada Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space Tesla uses a multipart aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris andor vehicle crashes Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Teslas battery pack cost in 2021 at 112 per kilowatthour kWh versus an industry average of 132 per kWh 18650 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical lithiumion battery cells When it built the first generation Roadster it used offtheshelf 18650type 18 mm diameter 65 mm height cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical However the decision turned out to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality Although the 18650type cells are the oldest technology they are used in the Model S and X vehicles Tesla sources these batteries with a nickelcobaltaluminum NCA cathode chemistry from Panasonics factories in Japan 2170 The next battery type to be used was the 2170type 21 mm diameter 70 mm height cylindrical cell The larger size was optimized for electric cars allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory the company sources 2170type batteries with a nickelcobaltaluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonics production line at Gigafactory Nevada In January 2021 Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin batteries with a nickelcobaltmanganese NMC cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solutions factories in China 4680 Teslas latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680type 46 mm diameter 80 mm height introduced in 2021 The battery was developed inhouse by Tesla and is physically 5times bigger than the 2170type again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack Currently Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry The company has already opened production lines in Fremont California and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas Prismatic Tesla also uses prismatic rectangular cells in many entrylevel Model 3 and Model Y vehicles The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery LFP or LiFePO4 which is a less energydense type but do not contain any nickel or cobalt which makes it less expensive to produce Tesla sources these batteries from CATLs factories in China As of April 2022 nearly half of Teslas vehicle production used prismatic cells Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack gridscale energy storage product Research Tesla invests in lithiumion battery research In 2016 the company established a 5year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia Canada with lead researcher Jeff Dahn Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over 200 million and sold in 2021 It also acquired Hibar Systems Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International a small Canadian battery company Software Tesla uses overtheair updates to deliver updates to vehicles adding features or fixing problems This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology by purchasing offtheshelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to For example for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on However Tesla has allowed customers who didnt pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and FullSelf Driving features even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features Motors Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors an induction motor and an internal permanent magnet IPM motor with synchronous reluctance motor SynRM characteristics The older design is a threephase fourpole alternating current induction motor also called an asynchronous motor with a copper rotor which inspired the Tesla logo These motors use electromagnetic induction by varying magnetic field to produce torque Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the firstgeneration Roadster Since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017 Tesla has also been building IPMSynRM motors These motors use an iron rotor with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core As an IPM motor it produces excellent starting torque however performance declines at high speeds due to counterelectromotive forces For highspeed operation Tesla engineers used irons reluctance property which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted The IPMSynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y the front motor of 2019onward versions of the Model S and X and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi North American Charging Standard The North American Charging Standard NACS is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022 Since then nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025 their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port Several electric vehicles charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors Autopilot and Full SelfDriving Glass In November 2016 the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3 It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roofs solar shingles Robotics In preparation for Model 3 production Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly and between 2015 and 2017 the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation Grohmann Automation Perbix Machine Company and Riviera Tool and Die Musk later said that the robotics slowed production of the vehicles Subsequently Tesla shifted towards using massive casting machines known as Giga Presses These machines streamline production by creating large singlepiece underbodies leading to reductions in production time labor costs factory footprint and the number of welding robots Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022 Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Teslas Full SelfDriving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Teslas factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks Facilities The company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world As of October 2024 the company also operates more than 1300 retail stores galleries service delivery and body shop locations globally North America Tesla was founded in San Carlos California in 2003 In 2008 the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park California The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year In 2010 Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto Teslas first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont California known as the Tesla Fremont Factory The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962 and then operated by NUMMI a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984 The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009 In 2010 Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount Teslas first purposebuilt facility was opened in Nevada in 2016 Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall battery cells in partnership with Panasonic Model 3 drivetrains and the Tesla Semi The factory received substantial subsidies abatements and credits from the local and state government that in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction allowed Tesla to operate essentially taxfree for 10 years later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016 Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program In 2017 the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof but faced multiple production challenges Since 2020 Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding In 2018 Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5000 cars produced a month The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high 150 feet wide and 900 feet long On July 23 2020 Tesla picked Austin Texas as the site of its fifth Gigafactory since then known as Gigafactory Texas Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States On December 1 2021 Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin However Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building On April 7 2022 Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event Tesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop California in 2021 to build the Megafactory to manufacture the Megapack the companys largescale energy storage product The location opened in 2022 Tesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard located a couple of miles from Teslas former headquarters building Tesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico the companys sixth Gigafactory near Monterrey Mexico However as of July 2024 the company has placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential election because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico Europe Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London Teslas European headquarters are in the Netherlands part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg including the companys European Distribution Centre In late 2016 Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016 Several countries campaigned to be the host and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019 On March 22 2022 Teslas first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin opened with planned capacity to produce 500000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars Asia Tesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo Japan in October 2010 In July 2018 Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai China which was Teslas first Gigafactory outside the United States The factory building was finished in August 2019 and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019 In 2021 China accounted for 26 of Tesla sales revenue and was the secondlargest market for Tesla after the United States which accounted for 45 of its sales Tesla expressed interest in 2023 in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023 Partners Panasonic In January 2010 Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickelbased lithiumion battery cells for electric vehicles Beginning in 2010 Panasonic invested 30 million for a multiyear collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles In July 2014 Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic PV cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo New York The partnership started in mid2017 and ended in early 2020 before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021 In March 2021 the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves Other current partners Tesla has longterm contracts in place for lithium supply In September 2020 Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy highpurity lithium ore for up to ten years specifically to supply spodumene concentrate from Piedmonts North Carolina mineral deposit In 2022 Tesla contracted for 110000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithiums lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations Former partners Daimler Daimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007 On May 19 2009 Daimler bought a stake of less than 10 in Tesla for a reported 50 million As part of the collaboration Herbert Kohler vicepresident of EDrive and Future Mobility at Daimler took a Tesla board seat On July 13 2009 Daimler sold 40 of its acquisition to Aabar an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi In October 2014 Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported 780 million Tesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010 The company also built electricpowertrain components for the MercedesBenz AClass ECell with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011 Tesla produced and codeveloped the MercedesBenz B250es powertrain which ended production in 2017 The electric motor was rated 134 hp 100 kW and 230 pound forcefeet 310 Nm with a 36 kWh 130 MJ battery The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km 124 mi with a top speed of 150 kmh 93 mph Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14kilowatthour 50 MJ lithiumion battery from Tesla Toyota In May 2010 Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for 42 million Toyota purchased 50 million in Tesla stock and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle In July 2010 the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011 Tesla supplied the lithium metaloxide battery and other powertrain components based on components from the Roadster The production version was unveiled in August 2012 using battery pack electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan also launched in 2012 The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3000 vehicles being produced before it was discontinued in 2014 According to Bloomberg News the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was marred by clashes between engineers Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EVs battery pack Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosures design and strengthened it In 2014 Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedans battery after some debrisrelated crashes led to cars catching fire On June 5 2017 Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership Mobileye Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014 Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26 2016 citing disagreements about how the technology was deployed Lawsuits and controversies Sexual harassment In 2021 seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Teslas Fremont factory They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling unwanted advances unwanted touching and discrimination while at work I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief Brooks told The Washington Post That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants Musk himself is not indicted but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk They cite his crude remarks about womens bodies wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to TITS and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment What were addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla said attorney David A Lowe In 2017 another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired In a statement to the Guardian Tesla confirmed the company had terminated her employment saying it had thoroughly investigated the employees allegations with the help of a neutral thirdparty expert and concluded her complaints were unmerited In May 2022 a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court rejecting Teslas request for closeddoor arbitration Labor disputes United States In June 2016 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA took issue with Teslas use of nondisclosure agreements NDAs regarding customer repairs and in October 2021 the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees and customers to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage From 2014 to 2018 Teslas Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA violations as the ten largest US auto plants combined An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports to downplay the extent of injuries In January 2019 former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees phones and spied on them while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen In 2020 the court ordered Hansens case to arbitration In June 2022 the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen has failed to establish the claims Accordingly his claims are denied and he shall take nothing In September 2019 a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize In March 2021 the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities Later after appealing a federal appeals court upheld the decision The California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging a pattern of racial harassment and bias at the Tesla Fremont factory As of April 2023 the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation Europe In October 2023 a strike was initiated by the Swedish labor union IF Metall against a Tesla subsidiary due to the companys refusal to sign a collective agreement The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via solidarity strikes to include services provided by postmen electricians and other workers involved with Tesla operations In September 2024 in an attempt to crack down on worker absenteeism Teslas Berlinarea factory conducted unannounced visits to the homes of employees out on sick leave Fraud allegations There have been numerous concerns about Teslas financial reporting In 2013 Bloomberg News questioned whether Teslas financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP reporting standards Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits In 2018 analysts expressed concerns over Teslas accounts receivable balance In September 2019 the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Teslas warranty reserves and lease accounting In a letter to his clients hedge fund manager David Einhorn whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of significant fraud and publicly questioned Teslas accounting practices telling Musk that he was beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist From 2012 to 2014 Tesla earned more than 295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a batteryswapping technology that was never made available to customers Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was gaming the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal and failed to disclose troubling facts essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition The members of the board settled in 2020 leaving Musk as the only defendant In April 2022 the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023 In August 2018 Elon Musk tweeted Am considering taking Tesla private at 420 Funding secured The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false Musk settled fraud charges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC over his false statements in September 2018 According to the terms of the settlement Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Teslas inhouse counsel he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily and two new independent directors were appointed to the companys board Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of 20 million each A civil classaction shareholder lawsuit over Musks statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Teslas board of directors as then constituted regarding claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private In February 2023 a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the classaction lawsuit In September 2018 Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI regarding its Model 3 production figures Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers unrelated to the FBI investigation was dismissed in March 2019 In May 2024 Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about Autopilot and Full SelfDriving Tesla US dealership disputes Unlike other automakers Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of companyowned stores In some areas Tesla operates locations called galleries which educate and inform customers about our products but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles This is because some jurisdictions particularly in the United States prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete lowering the price a customer pays They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their dealers The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale which they concluded would save consumers 8 in average vehicle price Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gaspowered vehicles Doing this according to the company would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gaspowered vehicles creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce aftersales service revenue a large profit center for most dealerships Intellectual property In January 2021 Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a willful and malicious thief and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox for example Guangzhi Cao a Tesla engineer was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021 in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla Misappropriation In 2018 a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Teslas board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musks stockbased compensation plan Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout worth more than 700 million in May 2020 In July 2023 Tesla board members returned 735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk Kimbal Musk Larry Ellison and others from 2017 to 2020 Environmental violations In 2019 The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017 In June 2019 Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District the violations took place around Tesla Fremonts paint shop where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019 Environmental violations and permit deviations at Teslas Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3 In June 2018 Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40 of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory After Tesla fired him for the leak Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Teslas security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory The court ruled in Teslas favor on September 17 2020 In January 2024 25 California counties sued Tesla accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally disposing of hazardous waste Later that week the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US15 million and admit to acting intentionally and negligent Moreover Tesla also agreed to train its employees on hazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Teslas facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5 years Property damage In August 2019 Walmart filed a multimilliondollar lawsuit against Tesla claiming that Teslas negligent installation and maintenance of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012 Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019 the terms of the settlement were not disclosed In April 2021 a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 overtheair software update after they failed to respond to the lawsuit The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136000 Norwegian kroner each 16000 Racism Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as a hotbed of racist behavior As of December 2021 three percent of leadership at the company were AfricanAmerican A former Black worker described the work environment at Teslas Buffalo plant as a very racist place Tesla and SpaceXs treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that the company discriminates specifically against African Americans and allows a racist environment in its factories Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court and behind closed doors Fremont CA plant According to the states Department of Fair Employment and Housing the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial and physically demanding work The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for discriminating against its Black workers In July 2021 former employee Melvin Berry received 1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against the company after he claimed he was referred to by the nword and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant In October 2021 a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff 137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Teslas Fremont facility during 20152016 In a blog Tesla stressed that Diaz was never really a Tesla worker and that most uttering of the nword were expressed in a friendly manner In April 2022 federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Teslas liability but reduced the total damage down to 15 million Diaz was given a twoweek deadline to decide if he would collect the damages In June 2022 Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the 15 million award opening the door for a new trial In April 2023 Diaz was awarded 32 million in the new trial COVID19 pandemic Teslas initial response to the COVID19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County California from the governments stayathome orders In an earnings call in April he was heard calling the public health orders fascist He had also called the publics response to the pandemic dumb and had said online that there would be zero cases by April In May 2020 while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th Tesla also sued Alameda County questioning the legality of the orders but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen In June 2020 Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe however some employees still expressed concern for their health In May 2020 Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work But in June Tesla dismissed an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory Three more employees at Teslas Fremont Factory claimed they were laid off for staying home out of fear of catching COVID19 This was subsequently denied by Tesla which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll COVID19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020 with about 450 total cases in that time out of the approximately 10000 workers at the plant 45 In China Tesla had what one executive described as not a green light from the government to get back to work but a flashingsirens police escort Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China including tax breaks cheap financing and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds Musk has praised Chinas way of doing things a controversial stance due to deteriorating USChinese relations the Persecution of Uyghurs in China and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong Right to repair In March 2023 a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M Lambrix in San Francisco alleging that the company unlawfully monopolized the market for maintenance and repair of its vehicles in violation of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law as a result of which owners were forced to pay supracompetitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times for maintenance services and repair parts The lawsuit was later combined with four other similar suits While six out of eight alleged antitrust violations were dismissed in June 2024 US District Judge Trina Thompson allowed two claims to proceed including alleged violations of Californias Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law UCL with the court finding evidence of a repairs monopoly in Teslas designing of its vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide and evidence of a parts monopoly in Teslas restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling to anyone other than Tesla Criticism Data privacy Tesla was only the second product ever reviewed by the Mozilla Foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns A Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers car cameras with one another Internal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in serious data protection lapses The data Krupski retrieved included information about current and former Tesla staff including passport numbers medical details and salaries and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to As of November 2023 the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands was investigating whether Teslas alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws Short sellers TSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to shape the perception of Tesla and move its stock In January 2020 20 of Tesla stock was shorted the highest at that time of any stock in the US equity markets By early 2021 according to CNN short sellers had lost 40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher Michael Burry a short seller portrayed in The Big Short had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management but removed his position in October 2021 Teslas mission According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from the company This suggested according to Kitman that the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims Giga New York audit In 2020 the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project concluding that it presented many red flags including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only 054 in economic benefits for every 1 spent by the state Delays Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products By one count in 2016 Musk had missed 20 projections In October 2017 Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5000 units per week by December A month later he revised that target to sometime in March 2018 Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solarpowered have also lagged projections Musk responded in late 2018 punctuality is not my strong suitI never made a massproduced car How am I supposed to know with precision when its gonna get done Vehicle product issues Recalls On April 20 2017 Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53000 70 of the 76000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and prevent the vehicles from moving On March 29 2018 Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosionsusceptible power steering bolts which could fail and require the driver to use increased force to control the vehicle In October 2020 Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues Soon after in November the NHTSA announced it had opened its investigation into 115000 Tesla cars regarding front suspension safety issues citing specifically 20152017 Model S and 20162017 Model X years Cases of the whompy wheel phenomenon which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars have been documented through 2020 In February 2021 Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rearview camera safety systems Autopilot and other features The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device wearing it out prematurely Also in February 2021 the German Federal Motor Transport Authority KBA ordered Tesla to recall 12300 Model X cars because of body mouldings problems In June 2021 Tesla recalled 5974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose which could lead to loss of tire pressure potentially increasing the chance of a crash On December 30 2021 Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475000 US model vehicles This included 356309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rearview camera issues and a further 119009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021 Around 1 of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rearview camera and around 14 of recalled model S may have the defect The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585000 vehicles Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving In September 2022 Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 11 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction increasing the risk of injury In response Tesla announced an overtheair software fix In February 2023 Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA the recall applied to approximately 360000 cars NHTSA found that FSD caused unreasonable risk when used on city streets In March 2023 about 3500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars secondrow seats In December 2023 following a 2yearlong investigation by the NHTSA Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer including 20122023 Model S 20162023 Model X 20172023 Model 3 and 20202023 Model Y covering 2031220 vehicles in total The NHTSA concluded that Autosteers controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation and states that affected vehicles will receive an overtheair software remedy Fires Tesla customers have reported the company as being slow to address how their cars can ignite In 2013 a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent Washington Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object As a result of this and other incidents Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage In March 2014 the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs All Model S cars manufactured after March 6 2014 have had the 025inch 64 mm aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new threelayer shield In October 2019 the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Teslas Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause noncrash fires Autopilot crashes A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractortrailer in 2016 while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safetyrelated defect trend In March 2018 a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in selfdriving mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway Through investigation the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway According to a document released in June 2021 the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot with some involving fatalities In early September 2021 the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with firstresponder vehicles In late September 2021 Tesla released an overtheair software update to detect emergency lights at night In October 2021 the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update In June 2022 the NHTSA said it would expand its probe extending it to 830000 cars from all current Tesla models The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the drivers supervision A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full SelfDriving repeatedly hit a childsized mannequin in its path but there has been controversy over its conclusions Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own independent tests using children NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice Software hacking In August 2015 two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the cars entertainment system The hack required the researchers to physically access the car Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced In September 2016 researchers at Tencents Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus CAN bus when the vehicles web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious WiFi hotspot This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days before the exploit was made public Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017 In January 2018 security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining Tesla responded by securing the compromised system rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy nor vehicle safety or security Later in 2019 Tesla awarded a car and 375000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event In June 2022 Martin Herfurt a security researcher in Austria discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle allowing an attacker to enroll their keys to a vehicle Phantom braking In February 2022 Tesla drivers have reported a surge in phantom braking events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automakers removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021 In response NHTSA has opened an investigation In May 2023 German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants The 100 gigabytes of data contained over 1000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations Driving range performance Tesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of indash range meters When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates Vehicle sales In 2023 Tesla ranked as the worlds bestselling battery electric passenger car manufacturer with a market share of 199 Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 18 million units up 38 from 2022 In March 2024 Tesla produced its six millionth car In Q4 2023 BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped but Tesla regained the title in Q1 2024 Sales are getting negatively impacted by Elon Musk support for Donald Trump Production and sales by quarter Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration On March 9 2020 the company produced its 1 millionth electric car becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone In the third quarter of 2021 Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone In the first quarter of 2023 the Model Y became the worlds bestselling car surpassing the Toyota Corolla Finances For the fiscal and calendar year 2021 Tesla reported a net income of 552 billion The annual revenue was 538 billion an increase of 71 over the previous fiscal year Of the revenue number in 2021 314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters Tesla ended 2021 with 176 billion of cash on hand down 18 billion from the end of 2020 31 In February 2021 a 10K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some 15 billion in the cryptocurrency bitcoin and the company indicated it would soon accept bitcoin as a form of payment Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Teslas environmental goals Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020 due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits The key trends for Tesla are as at the financial year ending December 31 Corporate affairs List of chief executives Martin Eberhard 20042007 Zeev Drori 20072008 Elon Musk since October 2008 List of board chairs Elon Musk 20042018 Robyn Denholm since November 2018 Board of directors Tesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors In an April 2017 public letter a group of influential Tesla investors including the California State Teachers Retirement System asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk The investors wrote that five of six current nonexecutive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement Teslas directors at the time included Brad Buss who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity Steve Jurvetson a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX Elon Musks brother Kimbal and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias both of whom also invested in SpaceX The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink At first Musk responded on Twitter writing that the investors should buy Ford stock because their governance is amazing Two days later he promised he would add two independent board members Kathleen WilsonThompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018 Ellison stepped down in August 2022 Former Tesla CTO J B Straubel who left the company in 2019 was elected to the board in 2023 Another criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996 Other previous board members include businessman Steve Westly Daimler executive Herbert Kohler CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno As of May 2023 the board members are Ownership structure The 10 largest shareholders of Tesla

    title: "Moon",
    originalContent:
      "The Moon is Earths only natural satellite It orbits at an average distance of 384400 km 238900 mi about 30 times the diameter of Earth Tidal forces between Earth and the Moon have synchronized the Moons orbital period lunar month with its rotation period lunar day at 295 Earth days causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth The Moons gravitational pulland to a lesser extent the Sunsare the main drivers of Earths tides In geophysical terms the Moon is a planetarymass object or satellite planet Its mass is 12 that of the Earth and its diameter is 3474 km 2159 mi roughly onequarter of Earths about as wide as the United States from coast to coast Within the Solar System it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its parent planet the fifth largest and most massive moon overall and larger and more massive than all known dwarf planets Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earths about half of that of Mars and the second highest among all Solar System moons after Jupiters moon Io The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial with no significant hydrosphere atmosphere or magnetic field It formed 451 billion years ago not long after Earths formation out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Marssized body called Theia The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains impact craters their ejecta raylike streaks rilles and mostly on the near side of the Moon by dark maria seas which are plains of cooled lava These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins The Moon is except when passing through Earths shadow during a lunar eclipse always illuminated by the Sun but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit producing the lunar phases The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earths night sky This is mainly due to its large angular diameter while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun allowing it to cover the Sun completely during a total solar eclipse From Earth about 59 of the lunar surface is visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective libration making parts of the far side of the Moon visible The Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge for humans having been crucial to cosmography mythology religion art time keeping natural science and spaceflight The first humanmade objects to fly to an extraterrestrial body were sent to the Moon starting in 1959 with the flyby of the Soviet Unions Luna 1 and the intentional impact of Luna 2 In 1966 the first soft landing by Luna 9 and orbital insertion by Luna 10 followed On July 20 1969 humans for the first time stepped on an extraterrestrial body landing on the Moon at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander Eagle of the United States Apollo 11 mission Five more crews were sent between then and 1972 each with two men landing on the surface The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew Since then exploration of the Moon has continued robotically and crewed missions are being planned to return beginning in the late 2020s Names and etymology The usual English proper name for Earths natural satellite is simply Moon with a capital M The noun moon is derived from Old English mna which like all its Germanic cognates stems from ProtoGermanic mnn which in turn comes from ProtoIndoEuropean mnsis month from earlier mnt genitive mneses which may be related to the verb measure of time Occasionally the name Luna is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish the Earths moon from others while in poetry Luna has been used to denote personification of the Moon Cynthia is another poetic name though rare for the Moon personified as a goddess while Selene literally Moon is the Greek goddess of the Moon The English adjective pertaining to the Moon is lunar derived from the Latin word for the Moon lna Selenian is an adjective used to describe the Moon as a world rather than as a celestial object but its use is rare It is derived from seln the Greek word for the Moon and its cognate selenic was originally a rare synonym but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium The element name selenium and the prefix seleno as in selenography the study of the physical features of the Moon come from this Greek word Artemis the Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt came to also be identified as the goddess of the Moon Selene and was sometimes called Cynthia after her birthplace on Mount Cynthus Her Roman equivalent is Diana The names Luna Cynthia and Selene are reflected in technical terms for lunar orbits such as apolune pericynthion and selenocentric The astronomical symbol for the Moon is a crescentdecrescent for example in M lunar mass also ML Natural history Lunar geologic timescale The lunar geological periods are named after their characteristic features from most impact craters outside the dark mare to the mare and later craters and finally the young still bright and therefore readily visible craters with ray systems like Copernicus or Tycho Formation Isotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System Historically several formation mechanisms have been proposed but none satisfactorily explains the features of the EarthMoon system A fission of the Moon from Earths crust through centrifugal force would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth Gravitational capture of a preformed Moon depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon A coformation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon None of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the EarthMoon system The prevailing theory is that the EarthMoon system formed after a giant impact of a Marssized body named Theia with the protoEarth The oblique impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and the material accreted and formed the Moon just beyond the Earths Roche limit of 256 R Giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System Computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the EarthMoon system These simulations show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor rather than the protoEarth However models from 2007 and later suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the protoEarth Other bodies of the inner Solar System such as Mars and Vesta have according to meteorites from them very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to Earth However Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions The isotopic equalization of the EarthMoon system might be explained by the postimpact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two although this is debated The impact would have released enough energy to liquefy both the ejecta and the Earths crust forming a magma ocean The liquefied ejecta could have then reaccreted into the EarthMoon system The newly formed Moon would have had its own magma ocean its depth is estimated from about 500 km 300 miles to 1737 km 1079 miles While the giantimpact theory explains many lines of evidence some questions are still unresolved most of which involve the Moons composition Models that have the Moon acquiring a significant amount of the protoearth are more difficult to reconcile with geochemical data for the isotopes of zirconium oxygen silicon and other elements A study published in 2022 using highresolution simulations up to 108 particles found that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside Earths Roche limit Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider stable orbits On November 1 2023 scientists reported that according to computer simulations remnants of Theia could still be present inside the Earth Natural development The newly formed Moon settled into a much closer Earth orbit than it has today Each body therefore appeared much larger in the sky of the other eclipses were more frequent and tidal effects were stronger Due to tidal acceleration the Moons orbit around Earth has become significantly larger with a longer period Following formation the Moon has cooled and most of its atmosphere has been stripped The lunar surface has since been shaped by large impact events and many small ones forming a landscape featuring craters of all ages The Moon was volcanically active until 12 billion years ago which laid down the prominent lunar maria Most of the mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period 3337 billion years ago though some are as young as 12 billion years and some as old as 42 billion years There are differing explanations for the eruption of mare basalts particularly their uneven occurrence which mainly appear on the nearside Causes of the distribution of the lunar highlands on the far side are also not well understood Topological measurements show the near side crust is thinner than the far side One possible scenario then is that large impacts on the near side may have made it easier for lava to flow onto the surface Physical characteristics The Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching with its long axis displaced 30 from facing the Earth due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for This fossil bulge indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth and that it is now too cold for its shape to restore hydrostatic equilibrium at its current orbital distance Size and mass The Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the Solar System categorizable as one of its planetarymass moons making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System Pluto While the minorplanet moon Charon of the PlutoCharon system is larger relative to Pluto the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets The Moons diameter is about 3500 km more than a quarter of Earths with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of either Mainland Australia Europe or the Contiguous United States which excludes Alaska etc The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers comparable to North and South America combined the combined American landmass having an area excluding all islands of 377 million square kilometers The Moons mass is 181 of Earths being the second densest among the planetary moons and having the second highest surface gravity after Io at 01654 g and an escape velocity of 238 kms 8600 kmh 5300 mph Structure The Moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium but has since departed from this condition It has a geochemically distinct crust mantle and core The Moon has a solid ironrich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 kilometres 150 mi and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 kilometres 190 mi Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometres 310 mi This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moons formation 45 billion years ago Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene after about threequarters of the magma ocean had crystallized lowerdensity plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop The final liquids to crystallize would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle with a high abundance of incompatible and heatproducing elements Consistent with this perspective geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests a crust of mostly anorthosite The Moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition which is more ironrich than that of Earth The crust is on average about 50 kilometres 31 mi thick The Moon is the seconddensest satellite in the Solar System after Io However the inner core of the Moon is small with a radius of about 350 kilometres 220 mi or less around 20 of the radius of the Moon Its composition is not well understood but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel analyzes of the Moons timevariable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5 GPa 49000 atm Gravitational field On average the Moons surface gravity is 162 ms2 01654 g 5318 fts2 about half of the surface gravity of Mars and about a sixth of Earths The Moons gravitational field is not uniform The details of the gravitational field have been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft The main lunar gravity features are mascons large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon There are some puzzles lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism Magnetic field The Moon has an external magnetic field of less than 02 nanoteslas or less than one hundred thousandth that of Earth The Moon does not have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization likely acquired early in its history when a dynamo was still operating Early in its history 4 billion years ago its magnetic field strength was likely close to that of Earth today This early dynamo field apparently expired by about one billion years ago after the lunar core had crystallized Theoretically some of the remnant magnetization may originate from transient magnetic fields generated during large impacts through the expansion of plasma clouds These clouds are generated during large impacts in an ambient magnetic field This is supported by the location of the largest crustal magnetizations situated near the antipodes of the giant impact basins Atmosphere The Moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum with a total mass of less than 10 tonnes 98 long tons 11 short tons The surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 1015 atm 03 nPa it varies with the lunar day Its sources include outgassing and sputtering a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions Elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium produced by sputtering also found in the atmospheres of Mercury and Io helium4 and neon from the solar wind and argon40 radon222 and polonium210 outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle The absence of such neutral species atoms or molecules as oxygen nitrogen carbon hydrogen and magnesium which are present in the regolith is not understood Water vapor has been detected by Chandrayaan1 and found to vary with latitude with a maximum at 6070 degrees it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith These gases either return into the regolith because of the Moons gravity or are lost to space either through solar radiation pressure or if they are ionized by being swept away by the solar winds magnetic field Studies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions demonstrate that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago This atmosphere sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions was twice the thickness of that of presentday Mars The ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space A permanent Moon dust cloud exists around the Moon generated by small particles from comets Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moons surface every 24 hours resulting in the ejection of dust particles The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes taking 5 minutes to rise and 5 minutes to fall On average 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon rising up to 100 kilometers above the surface Dust counts made by LADEEs Lunar Dust EXperiment LDEX found particle counts peaked during the Geminid Quadrantid Northern Taurid and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers when the Earth and Moon pass through comet debris The lunar dust cloud is asymmetric being more dense near the boundary between the Moons dayside and nightside Surface conditions Ionizing radiation from cosmic rays the Sun and the resulting neutron radiation produce radiation levels on average of 1369 millisieverts per day during lunar daytime which is about 26 times more than on the International Space Station with 053 millisieverts per day at about 400 km above Earth in orbit 510 times more than during a transAtlantic flight 200 times more than on Earths surface For further comparison radiation on a flight to Mars is about 184 millisieverts per day and on Mars on average 064 millisieverts per day with some locations on Mars possibly having levels as low as 0342 millisieverts per day The Moons axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 15427 much less than the 2344 of Earth Because of this small tilt the Moons solar illumination varies much less with season than on Earth and it allows for the existence of some peaks of eternal light at the Moons north pole at the rim of the crater Peary The surface is exposed to drastic temperature differences ranging from 120 C to 171 C depending on the solar irradiance Because of the lack of atmosphere temperatures of different areas vary particularly upon whether they are in sunlight or shadow making topographical details play a decisive role on local surface temperatures Parts of many craters particularly the bottoms of many polar craters are permanently shadowed these craters of eternal darkness have extremely low temperatures The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at 35 K 238 C 397 F and just 26 K 247 C 413 F close to the winter solstice in the north polar crater Hermite This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a spacecraft colder even than the surface of Pluto Blanketed on top of the Moons crust is a highly comminuted broken into ever smaller particles and impact gardened mostly gray surface layer called regolith formed by impact processes The finer regolith the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder The regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces it varies in thickness from 1015 m 3349 ft in the highlands and 45 m 1316 ft in the maria Beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the megaregolith a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometers thick These extreme conditions are considered to make it unlikely for spacecraft to harbor bacterial spores at the Moon for longer than just one lunar orbit Surface features The topography of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis Its most extensive topographic feature is the giant farside South PoleAitken basin some 2240 km 1390 mi in diameter the largest crater on the Moon and the secondlargest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System At 13 km 81 mi deep its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon The highest elevations of the Moons surface are located directly to the northeast which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South PoleAitken basin Other large impact basins such as Imbrium Serenitatis Crisium Smythii and Orientale possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims The far side of the lunar surface is on average about 19 km 12 mi higher than that of the near side The discovery of fault scarp cliffs suggest that the Moon has shrunk by about 90 metres 300 ft within the past billion years Similar shrinkage features exist on Mercury Mare Frigoris a basin near the north pole long assumed to be geologically dead has cracked and shifted Since the Moon does not have tectonic plates its tectonic activity is slow and cracks develop as it loses heat Scientists have confirmed the presence of a cave on the Moon near the Sea of Tranquillity not far from the 1969 Apollo 11 landing site The cave identified as an entry point to a collapsed lava tube is roughly 45 meters wide and up to 80 m long This discovery marks the first confirmed entry point to a lunar cave The analysis was based on photos taken in 2010 by NASAs Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter The caves stable temperature of around 17 C could provide a hospitable environment for future astronauts protecting them from extreme temperatures solar radiation and micrometeorites However challenges include accessibility and risks of avalanches and caveins This discovery offers potential for future lunar bases or emergency shelters Volcanic features The main features visible from Earth by the naked eye are dark and relatively featureless lunar plains called maria singular mare Latin for seas as they were once believed to be filled with water are vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava Although similar to terrestrial basalts lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water The majority of these lava deposits erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins though the Moons largest expanse of basalt flooding Oceanus Procellarum does not correspond to an obvious impact basin Different episodes of lava flows in maria can often be recognized by variations in surface albedo and distinct flow margins As the maria formed cooling and contraction of the basaltic lava created wrinkle ridges in some areas These low sinuous ridges can extend for hundreds of kilometers and often outline buried structures within the mare Another result of maria formation is the creation of concentric depressions along the edges known as arcuate rilles These features occur as the mare basalts sink inward under their own weight causing the edges to fracture and separate In addition to the visible maria the Moon has mare deposits covered by ejecta from impacts Called cryptomares these hidden mares are likely older than the exposed ones Conversely mare lava has obscured many impact melt sheets and pools Impact melts are formed when intense shock pressures from collisions vaporize and melt zones around the impact site Where still exposed impact melt can be distinguished from mare lava by its distribution albedo and texture Sinuous rilles found in and around maria are likely extinct lava channels or collapsed lava tubes They typically originate from volcanic vents meandering and sometimes branching as they progress The largest examples such as Schroters Valley and Rima Hadley are significantly longer wider and deeper than terrestrial lava channels sometimes featuring bends and sharp turns that again are uncommon on Earth Mare volcanism has altered impact craters in various ways including filling them to varying degrees and raising and fracturing their floors from uplift of mare material beneath their interiors Examples of such craters include Taruntius and Gassendi Some craters such as Hyginus are of wholly volcanic origin forming as calderas or collapse pits Such craters are relatively rare and tend to be smaller typically a few kilometers wide shallower and more irregularly shaped than impact craters They also lack the upturned rims characteristic of impact craters Several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side maria There are also some regions of pyroclastic deposits scoria cones and nonbasaltic domes made of particularly high viscosity lava Almost all maria are on the near side of the Moon and cover 31 of the surface of the near side compared with 2 of the far side This is likely due to a concentration of heatproducing elements under the crust on the near side which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up partially melt rise to the surface and erupt Most of the Moons mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period 3337 billion years ago though some being as young as 12 billion years and as old as 42 billion years In 2006 a study of Ina a tiny depression in Lacus Felicitatis found jagged relatively dustfree features that because of the lack of erosion by infalling debris appeared to be only 2 million years old Moonquakes and releases of gas indicate continued lunar activity Evidence of recent lunar volcanism has been identified at 70 irregular mare patches some less than 50 million years old This raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer because of the greater concentration of radioactive elements Evidence has been found for 210 million years old basaltic volcanism within the crater Lowell inside the Orientale basin Some combination of an initially hotter mantle and local enrichment of heatproducing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities on the far side in the Orientale basin The lightercolored regions of the Moon are called terrae or more commonly highlands because they are higher than most maria They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 44 billion years ago and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean In contrast to Earth no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events The concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side which may have formed in a slowvelocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moons formation Alternatively it may be a consequence of asymmetrical tidal heating when the Moon was much closer to the Earth Impact craters A major geologic process that has affected the Moons surface is impact cratering with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface There are estimated to be roughly 300000 craters wider than 1 km 06 mi on the Moons near side Lunar craters exhibit a variety of forms depending on their size In order of increasing diameter the basic types are simple craters with smooth bowl shaped interiors and upturned rims complex craters with flat floors terraced walls and central peaks peak ring basins and multiring basins with two or more concentric rings of peaks The vast majority of impact craters are circular but some like Cantor and Janssen have more polygonal outlines possibly guided by underlying faults and joints Others such as the Messier pair Schiller and Daniell are elongated Such elongation can result from highly oblique impacts binary asteroid impacts fragmentation of impactors before surface strike or closely spaced secondary impacts The lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events such as multiring formations like Nectaris Imbrium and Orientale that are between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon The lack of an atmosphere weather and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are wellpreserved Although only a few multiring basins have been definitively dated they are useful for assigning relative ages Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface However care needs to be exercised with the crater counting technique due to the potential presence of secondary craters Ejecta from impacts can create secondary craters that often appear in clusters or chains but can also occur as isolated formations at a considerable distance from the impact These can resemble primary craters and may even dominate small crater populations so their unidentified presence can distort age estimates The radiometric ages of impactmelted rocks collected during the Apollo missions cluster between 38 and 41 billion years old this has been used to propose a Late Heavy Bombardment period of increased impacts Highresolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in the 2010s show a contemporary craterproduction rate significantly higher than was previously estimated A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimeters of regolith on a timescale of 81000 years This rate is 100 times faster than the rate computed from models based solely on direct micrometeorite impacts Lunar swirls Lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moons surface They are characterized by a high albedo appear optically immature ie the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith and often have a sinuous shape Their shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls They are located in places with enhanced surface magnetic fields and many are located at the antipodal point of major impacts Well known swirls include the Reiner Gamma feature and Mare Ingenii They are hypothesized to be areas that have been partially shielded from the solar wind resulting in slower space weathering Presence of water Liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface When exposed to solar radiation water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space However since the 1960s scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygenrich lunar rocks and hydrogen from solar wind leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon Computer simulations suggest that up to 14000 km2 5400 sq mi of the surface may be in permanent shadow The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a costeffective plan the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive In years since signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface In 1994 the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft indicated the existence of small frozen pockets of water close to the surface However later radar observations by Arecibo suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters In 1998 the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions Volcanic lava beads brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15 showed small amounts of water in their interior The 2008 Chandrayaan1 spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice using the onboard Moon Mineralogy Mapper The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl in reflected sunlight providing evidence of large quantities of water ice on the lunar surface The spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1000 ppm Using the mappers reflectance spectra indirect lighting of areas in shadow confirmed water ice within 20 latitude of both poles in 2018 In 2009 LCROSS sent a 2300 kg 5100 lb impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater and detected at least 100 kg 220 lb of water in a plume of ejected material Another examination of the LCROSS data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 12 kg 342 26 lb In May 2011 6151410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 was reported the famous hightitanium orange glass soil of volcanic origin collected during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 37 billion years ago This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earths upper mantle Although of considerable selenological interest this insight does not mean that water is easily available since the sample originated many kilometers below the surface and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a stateoftheart ion microprobe instrument Analysis of the findings of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper M3 revealed in August 2018 for the first time definitive evidence for waterice on the lunar surface The data revealed the distinct reflective signatures of waterice as opposed to dust and other reflective substances The ice deposits were found on the North and South poles although it is more abundant in the South where water is trapped in permanently shadowed craters and crevices allowing it to persist as ice on the surface since they are shielded from the sun In October 2020 astronomers reported detecting molecular water on the sunlit surface of the Moon by several independent spacecraft including the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy SOFIA EarthMoon system Orbit The Earth and the Moon form the EarthMoon satellite system with a shared center of mass or barycenter This barycenter is 1700 km 1100 mi about a quarter of Earths radius beneath the Earths surface The Moons orbit is slightly elliptical with an orbital eccentricity of 0055 The semimajor axis of the geocentric lunar orbit called the lunar distance is approximately 400000 km 250000 miles or 128 lightseconds comparable to going around Earth 95 times The Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars its sidereal period about once every 273 days However because the EarthMoon system moves at the same time in its orbit around the Sun it takes slightly longer 295 days to return at the same lunar phase completing a full cycle as seen from Earth This synodic period or synodic month is commonly known as the lunar month and is equal to the length of the solar day on the Moon Due to tidal locking the Moon has a 11 spinorbit resonance This rotationorbit ratio makes the Moons orbital periods around Earth equal to its corresponding rotation periods This is the reason for only one side of the Moon its socalled near side being visible from Earth That said while the movement of the Moon is in resonance it still is not without nuances such as libration resulting in slightly changing perspectives making over time and location on Earth about 59 of the Moons surface visible from Earth Unlike most satellites of other planets the Moons orbital plane is closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planets equatorial plane The Moons orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small complex and interacting ways For example the plane of the Moons orbit gradually rotates once every 1861 years which affects other aspects of lunar motion These followon effects are mathematically described by Cassinis laws Tidal effects The gravitational attraction that Earth and the Moon as well as the Sun exert on each other manifests in a slightly greater attraction on the sides closest to each other resulting in tidal forces Ocean tides are the most widely experienced result of this but tidal forces also considerably affect other mechanics of Earth as well as the Moon and their system The lunar solid crust experiences tides of around 10 cm 4 in amplitude over 27 days with three components a fixed one due to Earth because they are in synchronous rotation a variable tide due to orbital eccentricity and inclination and a small varying component from the Sun The Earthinduced variable component arises from changing distance and libration a result of the Moons orbital eccentricity and inclination if the Moons orbit were perfectly circular and uninclined there would only be solar tides According to recent research scientists suggest that the Moons influence on the Earth may contribute to maintaining Earths magnetic field The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes although moonquakes can last for up to an hour significantly longer than terrestrial quakes because of scattering of the seismic vibrations in the dry fragmented upper crust The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972 The most commonly known effect of tidal forces are elevated sea levels called ocean tides While the Moon exerts most of the tidal forces the Sun also exerts tidal forces and therefore contributes to the tides as much as 40 of the Moons tidal force producing in interplay the spring and neap tides The tides are two bulges in the Earths oceans one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite As the Earth rotates on its axis one of the ocean bulges high tide is held in place under the Moon while another such tide is opposite The tide under the Moon is explained by the Moons gravity being stronger on the water close to it The tide on the opposite side can be explained either by the centrifugal force as the Earth orbits the barycenter or by the waters inertia as the Moons gravity is stronger on the solid Earth close to it and it is pull away from the farther water Thus there are two high tides and two low tides in about 24 hours Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earths rotation the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes the 25 minutes is due to the Moons time to orbit the Earth If the Earth were a water world one with no continents it would produce a tide of only one meter and that tide would be very predictable but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects the frictional coupling of water to Earths rotation through the ocean floors the inertia of waters movement ocean basins that grow shallower near land the sloshing of water between different ocean basins As a result the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained incidentally by theory System evolution Delays in the tidal peaks of both ocean and solidbody tides cause torque in opposition to the Earths rotation This drains angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from Earths rotation slowing the Earths rotation That angular momentum lost from the Earth is transferred to the Moon in a process known as tidal acceleration which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit while lowering orbital speed around the Earth Thus the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing and the Earths rotation is slowing in reaction Measurements from laser reflectors left during the Apollo missions lunar ranging experiments have found that the Moons distance increases by 38 mm 15 in per year roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow Atomic clocks show that Earths day lengthens by about 17 microseconds every year slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds This tidal drag makes the rotation of the Earth and the orbital period of the Moon very slowly match This matching first results in tidally locking the lighter body of the orbital system as is already the case with the Moon Theoretically in 50 billion years the Earths rotation will have slowed to the point of matching the Moons orbital period causing the Earth to always present the same side to the Moon However the Sun will become a red giant most likely engulfing the EarthMoon system long before then If the EarthMoon system isnt engulfed by the enlarged Sun the drag from the solar atmosphere can cause the orbit of the Moon to decay Once the orbit of the Moon closes to a distance of 18470 km 11480 mi it will cross Earths Roche limit meaning that tidal interaction with Earth would break apart the Moon turning it into a ring system Most of the orbiting rings will begin to decay and the debris will impact Earth Hence even if the Sun does not swallow up Earth the planet may be left moonless Position and appearance The Moons highest altitude at culmination varies by its lunar phase or more correctly its orbital position and time of the year or more correctly the position of the Earths axis The full moon is highest in the sky during winter and lowest during summer for each hemisphere respectively with its altitude changing towards dark moon to the opposite At the North and South Poles the Moon is 24 hours above the horizon for two weeks every tropical month about 273 days comparable to the polar day of the tropical year Zooplankton in the Arctic use moonlight when the Sun is below the horizon for months on end The apparent orientation of the Moon depends on its position in the sky and the hemisphere of the Earth from which it is being viewed In the northern hemisphere it appears upside down compared to the view from the southern hemisphere Sometimes the horns of a crescent moon appear to be pointing more upwards than sideways This phenomenon is called a wet moon and occurs more frequently in the tropics The distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356400 km 221500 mi perigee to 406700 km 252700 mi apogee making the Moons distance and apparent size fluctuate up to 14 On average the Moons angular diameter is about 052 roughly the same apparent size as the Sun see Eclipses In addition a purely psychological effect known as the Moon illusion makes the Moon appear larger when close to the horizon Rotation The tidally locked synchronous rotation of the Moon as it orbits the Earth results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards the planet The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side and the opposite the far side The far side is often inaccurately called the dark side but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side once every 295 Earth days During dark moon to new moon the near side is dark The Moon originally rotated at a faster rate but early in its history its rotation slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by Earth With time the energy of rotation of the Moon on its axis was dissipated as heat until there was no rotation of the Moon relative to Earth In 2016 planetary scientists using data collected on the 199899 NASA Lunar Prospector mission found two hydrogenrich areas most likely former water ice on opposite sides of the Moon It is speculated that these patches were the poles of the Moon billions of years ago before it was tidally locked to Earth Illumination and phases Half of the Moons surface is always illuminated by the Sun except during a lunar eclipse Earth also reflects light onto the Moon observable at times as Earthlight when it is reflected back to Earth from areas of the near side of the Moon that are not illuminated by the Sun Since the Moons axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is 15427 in every draconic year 34662 days the Sun moves from being 15427 north of the lunar equator to being 15427 south of it and then back just as on Earth the Sun moves from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn and back once every tropical year The poles of the Moon are therefore in the dark for half a draconic year or with only part of the Sun visible and then lit for half a draconic year The amount of sunlight falling on horizontal areas near the poles depends on the altitude angle of the Sun But these seasons have little effect in more equatorial areas With the different positions of the Moon different areas of it are illuminated by the Sun This illumination of different lunar areas as viewed from Earth produces the different lunar phases during the synodic month The phase is equal to the area of the visible lunar sphere that is illuminated by the Sun This area or degree of illumination is given by 1 cos e 2 sin 2 e 2 displaystyle 1cos e2sin 2e2 where e displaystyle e is the elongation ie the angle between Moon the observer on Earth and the Sun Brightness and apparent size of the Moon changes also due to its elliptic orbit around Earth At perigee closest since the Moon is up to 14 closer to Earth than at apogee most distant it subtends a solid angle which is up to 30 larger Consequently given the same phase the Moons brightness also varies by up to 30 between apogee and perigee A full or new moon at such a position is called a supermoon Observational phenomena There has been historical controversy over whether observed features on the Moons surface change over time Today many of these claims are thought to be illusory resulting from observation under different lighting conditions poor astronomical seeing or inadequate drawings However outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena Recently it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km 19 mi diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago Albedo and color The Moon has an exceptionally low albedo giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt Despite this it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun This is due partly to the brightness enhancement of the opposition surge the Moon at quarter phase is only onetenth as bright rather than half as bright as at full moon Additionally color constancy in the visual system recalibrates the relations between the colors of an object and its surroundings and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark the sunlit Moon is perceived as a bright object The edges of the full moon seem as bright as the center without limb darkening because of the reflective properties of lunar soil which retroreflects light more towards the Sun than in other directions The Moons color depends on the light the Moon reflects which in turn depends on the Moons surface and its features having for example large darker regions In general the lunar surface reflects a browntinged gray light At times the Moon can appear red or blue It may appear red during a lunar eclipse because of the red spectrum of the Suns light being refracted onto the Moon by Earths atmosphere Because of this red color lunar eclipses are also sometimes called blood moons The Moon can also seem red when it appears at low angles and through a thick atmosphere The Moon may appear blue depending on the presence of certain particles in the air such as volcanic particles in which case it can be called a blue moon Because the words red moon and blue moon can also be used to refer to specific full moons of the year they do not always refer to the presence of red or blue moonlight Eclipses Eclipses only occur when the Sun Earth and Moon are all in a straight line termed syzygy Solar eclipses occur at new moon when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth In contrast lunar eclipses occur at full moon when Earth is between the Sun and Moon The apparent size of the Moon is roughly the same as that of the Sun with both being viewed at close to onehalf a degree wide The Sun is much larger than the Moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller Moon from the perspective of Earth The variations in apparent size due to the noncircular orbits are nearly the same as well though occurring in different cycles This makes possible both total with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun and annular with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun solar eclipses In a total eclipse the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing As it evolves toward becoming a red giant the size of the Sun and its apparent diameter in the sky are slowly increasing The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses and no annular eclipses were possible Likewise hundreds of millions of years in the future the Moon will no longer cover the Sun completely and total solar eclipses will not occur As the Moons orbit around Earth is inclined by about 5145 5 9 to the orbit of Earth around the Sun eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon For an eclipse to occur the Moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon and of the Moon by Earth is described by the saros which has a period of approximately 18 years Because the Moon continuously blocks the view of a halfdegreewide circular area of the sky the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted hidden from view In this way a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet nor at the same time Because of the precession of the lunar orbit each year different stars are occulted History of exploration and human presence Pretelescopic observation before 1609 It is believed by some that the oldest cave paintings from up to 40000 BP of bulls and geometric shapes or 2030000 year old tally sticks were used to observe the phases of the Moon keeping time using the waxing and waning of the Moons phases One of the earliestdiscovered possible depictions of the Moon is a 3000 BCE rock carving Orthostat 47 at Knowth Ireland Lunar deities like NannaSin featuring crescents are found since the 3rd millennium BCE Though the oldest found and identified astronomical depiction of the Moon is the Nebra sky disc from c 18001600 BCE The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras d 428 BC reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks and that the latter reflected the light of the former 227 Elsewhere in the 5th century BC to 4th century BC Babylonian astronomers had recorded the 18year Saros cycle of lunar eclipses and Indian astronomers had described the Moons monthly elongation The Chinese astronomer Shi Shen fl 4th century BC gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses 411 In Aristotles 384322 BC description of the universe the Moon marked the boundary between the spheres of the mutable elements earth water air and fire and the imperishable stars of aether an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries Archimedes 287212 BC designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the Moon and other objects in the Solar System In the 2nd century BC Seleucus of Seleucia correctly thought that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon and that their height depends on the Moons position relative to the Sun In the same century Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance The Chinese of the Han dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to qi and their radiating influence theory recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun Jing Fang 7837 BC noted the sphericity of the Moon 413414 Ptolemy 90168 AD greatly improved on the numbers of Aristarchus calculating a mean distance of 59 times Earths radius and a diameter of 0292 Earth diameters close to the correct values of about 60 and 0273 respectively In the 2nd century AD Lucian wrote the novel A True Story in which the heroes travel to the Moon and meet its inhabitants In 510 AD the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his Aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the Moon The astronomer and physicist Ibn alHaytham 9651039 found that sunlight was not reflected from the Moon like a mirror but that light was emitted from every part of the Moons sunlit surface in all directions Shen Kuo 10311095 of the Song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that when doused with white powder and viewed from the side would appear to be a crescent 415416 During the Middle Ages before the invention of the telescope the Moon was increasingly recognized as a sphere though many believed that it was perfectly smooth Telescopic exploration 16091959 In 1609 Galileo Galilei used an early telescope to make drawings of the Moon for his book Sidereus Nuncius and deduced that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters Thomas Harriot had made but not published such drawings a few months earlier Telescopic mapping of the Moon followed later in the 17th century the efforts of Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today The more exact 18341836 Mappa Selenographica of Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich von Mdler and their associated 1837 book Der Mond the first trigonometrically accurate study of lunar features included the heights of more than a thousand mountains and introduced the study of the Moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography Lunar craters first noted by Galileo were thought to be volcanic until the 1870s proposal of Richard Proctor that they were formed by collisions This view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist Grove Karl Gilbert and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of astrogeology First missions to the Moon 19591976 After World War II the first launch systems were developed and by the end of the 1950s they reached capabilities that allowed the Soviet Union and the United States to launch spacecraft into space The Cold War fueled a closely followed development of launch systems by the two states resulting in the socalled Space Race and its later phase the Moon Race accelerating efforts and interest in exploration of the Moon After the first spaceflight of Sputnik 1 in 1957 during International Geophysical Year the spacecraft of the Soviet Unions Luna program were the first to accomplish a number of goals Following three unnamed failed missions in 1958 the first humanmade object Luna 1 escaped Earths gravity and passed near the Moon in 1959 Later that year the first humanmade object Luna 2 reached the Moons surface by intentionally impacting By the end of the year Luna 3 reached as the first humanmade object the normally occluded far side of the Moon taking the first photographs of it The first spacecraft to perform a successful lunar soft landing was Luna 9 and the first vehicle to orbit the Moon was Luna 10 both in 1966 Following President John F Kennedys 1961 commitment to a crewed Moon landing before the end of the decade the United States under NASA leadership launched a series of uncrewed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for human missions the Jet Propulsion Laboratorys Ranger program the Lunar Orbiter program and the Surveyor program The crewed Apollo program was developed in parallel after a series of uncrewed and crewed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar human landing in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first human mission to lunar orbit the first Earthlings two tortoises had circled the Moon three months earlier on the Soviet Unions Zond 5 followed by turtles on Zond 6 The first time a person landed on the Moon and any extraterrestrial body was when Neil Armstrong the commander of the American mission Apollo 11 set foot on the Moon at 0256 UTC on July 21 1969 Considered the culmination of the Space Race an estimated 500 million people worldwide watched the transmission by the Apollo TV camera the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time While at the same time another mission the robotic sample return mission Luna 15 by the Soviet Union had been in orbit around the Moon becoming together with Apollo 11 the first ever case of two extraterrestrial missions being conducted at the same time The Apollo missions 11 to 17 except Apollo 13 which aborted its planned lunar landing removed 38005 kilograms 83787 lb of lunar rock and soil in 2196 separate samples Scientific instrument packages were installed on the lunar surface during all the Apollo landings Longlived instrument stations including heat flow probes seismometers and magnetometers were installed at the Apollo 12 14 15 16 and 17 landing sites Direct transmission of data to Earth concluded in late 1977 because of budgetary considerations but as the stations lunar laser ranging cornercube retroreflector arrays are passive instruments they are still being used Apollo 17 in 1972 remains the last crewed mission to the Moon Explorer 49 in 1973 was the last dedicated US probe to the Moon until the 1990s The Soviet Union continued sending robotic missions to the Moon until 1976 deploying in 1970 with Luna 17 the first remote controlled rover Lunokhod 1 on an extraterrestrial surface and collecting and returning 03 kg of rock and soil samples with three Luna sample return missions Luna 16 in 1970 Luna 20 in 1972 and Luna 24 in 1976 Moon Treaty and explorational absence 19761990 Following the last Soviet mission to the Moon of 1976 there was little further lunar exploration for fourteen years Astronautics had shifted its focus towards the exploration of the inner eg Venera program and outer eg Pioneer 10 1972 Solar System planets but also towards Earth orbit developing and continuously operating beside communication satellites Earth observation satellites eg Landsat program 1972 space telescopes and particularly space stations eg Salyut program 1971 Negotiation in 1979 of Moon treaty and its subsequent ratification in 1984 was the only major activity regarding the Moon until 1990 Renewed exploration 1990present In 1990 HitenHagoromo the first dedicated lunar mission since 1976 reached the Moon Sent by Japan it became the first mission that was not a Soviet Union or US mission to the Moon In 1994 the US dedicated a mission to fly a spacecraft Clementine to the Moon again for the first time since 1973 This mission obtained the first nearglobal topographic map of the Moon and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface In 1998 this was followed by the Lunar Prospector mission whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles which is likely to have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters The next years saw a row of first missions to the Moon by a new group of states actively exploring the Moon Between 2004 and 2006 the first spacecraft by the European Space Agency ESA SMART1 reached the Moon recording the first detailed survey of chemical elements on the lunar surface The Chinese Lunar Exploration Program reached the Moon for the first time with the orbiter Change 1 20072009 obtaining a full image map of the Moon India reached orbited and impacted the Moon in 2008 for the first time with its Chandrayaan1 and Moon Impact Probe becoming the fifth and sixth state to do so creating a highresolution chemical mineralogical and photogeological map of the lunar surface and confirming the presence of water molecules in lunar soil The US launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter LRO and the LCROSS impactor on June 18 2009 LCROSS completed its mission by making a planned and widely observed impact in the crater Cabeus on October 9 2009 whereas LRO is currently in operation obtaining precise lunar altimetry and highresolution imagery China continued its lunar program in 2010 with Change 2 mapping the surface at a higher resolution over an eightmonth period and in 2013 with Change 3 a lunar lander along with a lunar rover named Yutu Chinese lit Jade Rabbit This was the first lunar rover mission since Lunokhod 2 in 1973 and the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 in 1976 making China the third country to achieve this In 2014 the first privately funded probe the Manfred Memorial Moon Mission reached the Moon Another Chinese rover mission Change 4 achieved the first landing on the Moons far side in early 2019 Also in 2019 India successfully sent its second probe Chandrayaan2 to the Moon In 2020 China carried out its first robotic sample return mission Change 5 bringing back 1731 grams of lunar material to Earth The US developed plans for returning to the Moon beginning in 2004 and with the signing of the USled Artemis Accords in 2020 the Artemis program aims to return the astronauts to the Moon in the 2020s The Accords have been joined by a growing number of countries The introduction of the Artemis Accords has fueled a renewed discussion about the international framework and cooperation of lunar activity building on the Moon Treaty and the ESAled Moon Village concept 2023 and 2024 India and Japan became the fourth and fifth country to soft land a spacecraft on the Moon following the Soviet Union and United States in the 1960s and China in the 2010s Notably Japans spacecraft the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon survived 3 lunar nights The IM1 lander became the first commercially built lander to land on the Moon in 2024 China launched the Change 6 on May 3 2024 which conducted another lunar sample return from the far side of the Moon It also carried a Chinese rover to conduct infrared spectroscopy of lunar surface Pakistan sent a lunar orbiter called ICUBEQ along with Change 6 NovaC 2 iSpace Lander and Blue Ghost are all planned to launch to the Moon in 2024 Future Beside the progressing Artemis program and supporting Commercial Lunar Payload Services leading an international and commercial crewed opening up of the Moon and sending the first woman person of color and nonUS citizen to the Moon in the 2020s China is continuing its ambitious Change program having announced with Russias struggling LunaGlob program joint missions Both the Chinese and US lunar programs have the goal to establish in the 2030s a lunar base with their international partners though the US and its partners will first establish an orbital Lunar Gateway station in the 2020s from which Artemis missions will land the Human Landing System to set up temporary surface camps While the Apollo missions were explorational in nature the Artemis program plans to establish a more permanent presence To this end NASA is partnering with industry leaders to establish key elements such as modern communication infrastructure A 4G connectivity demonstration is to be launched aboard an Intuitive Machines NovaC lander in 2024 Another focus is on in situ resource utilization which is a key part of the DARPA lunar programs DARPA has requested that industry partners develop a 10year lunar architecture plan to enable the beginning of a lunar economy Human presence In 1959 the first extraterrestrial probes reached the Moon Luna program just a year into the space age after the first ever orbital flight Since then humans have sent a range of probes and people to the Moon The first stay of people on the Moon was conducted in 1969 in a series of crewed exploration missions the Apollo Program the last having taken place in 1972 Uninterrupted presence has been the case through the remains of impactors landings and lunar orbiters Some landings and orbiters have maintained a small lunar infrastructure providing continuous observation and communication at the Moon Increasing human activity in cislunar space as well as on the Moons surface particularly missions at the far side of the Moon or the lunar north and south polar regions are in need for a lunar infrastructure For that purpose orbiters in orbits around the Moon or the EarthMoon Lagrange points have since 2006 been operated With highly eccentric orbits providing continuous communication as with the orbit of Queqiao and Queqiao2 relay satellite or the planned first extraterrestrial space station the Lunar Gateway Human impact While the Moon has the lowest planetary protection targetcategorization its degradation as a pristine body and scientific place has been discussed If there is astronomy performed from the Moon it will need to be free from any physical and radio pollution While the Moon has no significant atmosphere traffic and impacts on the Moon causes clouds of dust that can spread far and possibly contaminate the original state of the Moon and its special scientific content Scholar Alice Gorman asserts that although the Moon is inhospitable it is not dead and that sustainable human activity would require treating the Moons ecology as a coparticipant The socalled Tardigrade affair of the 2019 crashed Beresheet lander and its carrying of tardigrades has been discussed as an example for lacking measures and lacking international regulation for planetary protection Space debris beyond Earth around the Moon has been considered as a future challenge with increasing numbers of missions to the Moon particularly as a danger for such missions As such lunar waste management has been raised as an issue which future lunar missions particularly on the surface need to tackle Human remains have been transported to the Moon including by private companies such as Celestis and Elysium Space Because the Moon has been sacred or significant to many cultures the practice of space burials have attracted criticism from indigenous peoples leaders For example thenNavajo Nation president Albert Hale criticized NASA for sending the cremated ashes of scientist Eugene Shoemaker to the Moon in 1998 Beside the remains of human activity on the Moon there have been some intended permanent installations like the Moon Museum art piece Apollo 11 goodwill messages six lunar plaques the Fallen Astronaut memorial and other artifacts Longterm missions continuing to be active are some orbiters such as the 2009launched Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter surveilling the Moon for future missions as well as some Landers such as the 2013launched Change 3 with its Lunar Ultraviolet Telescope still operational Five retroreflectors have been installed on the Moon since the 1970s and since used for accurate measurements of the physical librations through laser ranging to the Moon There are several missions by different agencies and companies planned to establish a longterm human presence on the Moon with the Lunar Gateway as the currently most advanced project as part of the Artemis program Astronomy from the Moon The Moon has been used as a site for astronomical and Earth observations The Earth appears in the Moons sky with an apparent size of 1 48 to 2 three to four times the size of the Moon or Sun in Earths sky or about the apparent width of two little fingers at an arms length away Observations from the Moon started as early as 1966 with the first images of Earth from the Moon taken by Lunar Orbiter 1 Of particular cultural significance is the 1968 photograph called Earthrise taken by Bill Anders of Apollo 8 in 1968 In April 1972 the Apollo 16 mission set up the first dedicated telescope the Far Ultraviolet CameraSpectrograph recording various astronomical photos and spectra The Moon is recognized as an excellent site for telescopes It is relatively nearby certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold and especially useful for infrared telescopes and radio telescopes on the far side would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth The lunar soil although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with an ionic liquid Living on the Moon The only instances of humans living on the Moon have taken place in an Apollo Lunar Module for several days at a time for example during the Apollo 17 mission One challenge to astronauts during their stay on the surface is that lunar dust sticks to their suits and is carried into their quarters Astronauts could taste and smell the dust which smells like gunpowder and was called the Apollo aroma This fine lunar dust can cause health issues In 2019 at least one plant seed sprouted in an experiment on the Change 4 lander It was carried from Earth along with other small life in its Lunar Micro Ecosystem Legal status Although Luna landers scattered pennants of the Soviet Union on the Moon and US flags were symbolically planted at their landing sites by the Apollo astronauts no nation claims ownership of any part of the Moons surface Likewise no private ownership of parts of the Moon or as a whole is considered credible The 1967 Outer Space Treaty defines the Moon and all outer space as the province of all mankind It restricts the use of the Moon to peaceful purposes explicitly banning military installations and weapons of mass destruction A majority of countries are parties of this treaty The 1979 Moon Agreement was created to elaborate and restrict the exploitation of the Moons resources by any single nation leaving it to a yet unspecified international regulatory regime As of January 2020 it has been signed and ratified by 18 nations none of which have human spaceflight capabilities Since 2020 countries have joined the US in their Artemis Accords which are challenging the treaty The US has furthermore emphasized in a presidential executive order Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources that the United States does not view outer space as a global commons and calls the Moon Agreement a failed attempt at constraining free enterprise With Australia signing and ratifying both the Moon Treaty in 1986 as well as the Artemis Accords in 2020 there has been a discussion if they can be harmonized In this light an Implementation Agreement for the Moon Treaty has been advocated for as a way to compensate for the shortcomings of the Moon Treaty and to harmonize it with other laws and agreements such as the Artemis Accords allowing it to be more widely accepted In the face of such increasing commercial and national interest particularly prospecting territories US lawmakers have introduced in late 2020 specific regulation for the conservation of historic landing sites and interest groups have argued for making such sites World Heritage Sites and zones of scientific value protected zones all of which add to the legal availability and territorialization of the Moon In 2021 the Declaration of the Rights of the Moon was created by a group of lawyers space archaeologists and concerned citizens drawing on precedents in the Rights of Nature movement and the concept of legal personality for nonhuman entities in space Coordination and regulation Increasing human activity at the Moon has raised the need for coordination to safeguard international and commercial lunar activity Issues from cooperation to mere coordination through for example the development of a shared Lunar time have been raised In particular the establishment of an international or United Nations regulatory regime for lunar human activity has been called for by the Moon Treaty and suggested through an Implementation Agreement but remains contentious Current lunar programs are multilateral with the USled Artemis program and the Chinaled International Lunar Research Station For broader international cooperation and coordination the International Lunar Exploration Working Group ILEWG the Moon Village Association MVA and more generally the International Space Exploration Coordination Group ISECG has been established In culture and life Timekeeping Since prehistoric times people have taken note of the Moons phases and its waxing and waning cycle and used it to keep record of time Tally sticks notched bones dating as far back as 2030000 years ago are believed by some to mark the phases of the Moon The counting of the days between the Moons phases gave eventually rise to generalized time periods of lunar cycles as months and possibly of its phases as weeks The words for the month in a range of different languages carry this relation between the period of the month and the Moon etymologically The English month as well as moon and its cognates in other IndoEuropean languages eg the Latin mensis and Ancient Greek meis or mn meaning month stem from the ProtoIndoEuropean PIE root of moon mh1nt derived from the PIE verbal root meh1 to measure indicating a functional conception of the Moon ie marker of the month cf the English words measure and menstrual To give another example from a different language family the Chinese language uses the same word for moon as well as for month which furthermore can be found in the symbols for the word week This lunar timekeeping gave rise to the historically dominant but varied lunisolar calendars The 7thcentury Islamic calendar is an example of a purely lunar calendar where months are traditionally determined by the visual sighting of the hilal or earliest crescent moon over the horizon Of particular significance has been the occasion of full moon highlighted and celebrated in a range of calendars and cultures an example being the Buddhist Vesak The full moon around the southern or northern autumnal equinox is often called the harvest moon and is celebrated with festivities such as the Harvest Moon Festival of the Chinese lunar calendar its second most important celebration after the Chinese lunisolar Lunar New Year Furthermore association of time with the Moon can also be found in religion such as the ancient Egyptian temporal and lunar deity Khonsu Cultural representation Since prehistoric times humans have depicted and later described their perception of the Moon and its importance for them and their cosmologies It has been characterized and associated in many different ways from having a spirit or being a deity and an aspect thereof or an aspect in astrology Crescent For the representation of the Moon especially its lunar phases the crescent has been a recurring symbol in a range of cultures since at least 3000 BCE or possibly earlier with bull horns dating to the earliest cave paintings at 40000 BP In writing systems such as Chinese the crescent has developed into the symbol the word for Moon and in ancient Egyptian it was the symbol meaning Moon and spelled like the ancient Egyptian lunar deity Iah which the other ancient Egyptian lunar deities Khonsu and Thoth were associated with Iconographically the crescent was used in Mesopotamia as the primary symbol of NannaSn the ancient Sumerian lunar deity who was the father of InannaIshtar the goddess of the planet Venus symbolized as the eight pointed Star of Ishtar and UtuShamash the god of the Sun symbolized as a disc optionally with eight rays all three often depicted next to each other NannaSn is like some other lunar deities for example Iah and Khonsu of ancient Egypt MeneSelene of ancient Greece and Luna of ancient Rome depicted as a horned deity featuring crescent shaped headgears or crowns The particular arrangement of the crescent with a star known as the star and crescent goes back to the Bronze Age representing either the Sun and Moon or the Moon and the planet Venus in combination It came to represent the selene goddess Artemis and via the patronage of Hecate which as triple deity under the epithet trimorphostrivia included aspects of ArtemisDiana came to be used as a symbol of Byzantium with Virgin Mary Queen of Heaven later taking her place becoming depicted in Marian veneration on a crescent and adorned with stars Since then the heraldric use of the star and crescent proliferated Byzantiums symbolism possibly influencing the development of the Ottoman flag specifically the combination of the Turkish crescent with a star and becoming a popular symbol for Islam as the hilal of the Islamic calendar and for a range of nations Other association The features of the Moon the contrasting brighter highlands and darker maria have been seen by different cultures forming abstract shapes Such shapes are among others the Man in the Moon eg Coyolxuhqui or the Moon Rabbit eg the Chinese Tuer Ye or in Indigenous American mythologies the aspect of the Mayan Moon goddess from which possibly Awilix is derived or of MetztliTcciztcatl Occasionally some lunar deities have been also depicted driving a chariot across the sky such as the Hindu ChandraSoma the Greek Artemis which is associated with Selene or Luna Selenes ancient Roman equivalent Color and material wise the Moon has been associated in Western alchemy with silver while gold is associated with the Sun Through a miracle the socalled splitting of the Moon Arabic in Islam association with the Moon applies also to Muhammad Modern culture representation The perception of the Moon in modern times has been informed by telescope enabled modern astronomy and later by spaceflight enabled actual human activity at the Moon particularly the culturally impactful lunar landings These new insights inspired cultural references connecting romantic reflections about the Moon and speculative fiction such as sciencefiction dealing with the Moon Contemporarily the Moon has been seen as a place for economic expansion into space with missions prospecting for lunar resources This has been accompanied with renewed public and critical reflection on humanitys cultural and legal relation to the celestial body especially regarding colonialism as in the 1970 poem Whitey on the Moon In this light the Moons nature has been invoked particularly for lunar conservation and as a common In 2021 20 July the date of the first crewed Moon landing became the annual International Moon Day Lunar effect The lunar effect is a purported unproven correlation between specific stages of the roughly 295day lunar cycle and behavior and physiological changes in living beings on Earth including humans The Moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality the words lunacy and lunatic are derived from the Latin name for the Moon Luna Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals believing that the brain which is mostly water must be affected by the Moon and its power over the tides but the Moons gravity is too slight to affect any single person Even today people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals traffic accidents homicides or suicides increase during a full moon but dozens of studies invalidate these claims See also List of natural satellites Selenography geography of the Moon Coordinated Lunar Time

    title: "Mount Everest",
    originalContent:
      "Mount Everest known locally as Sagarmatha or Qomolangma is Earths highest mountain above sea level located in the Mahalangur Himal subrange of the Himalayas The ChinaNepal border runs across its summit point Its elevation snow height of 884886 m 29031 ft 812 in was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities Mount Everest attracts many climbers including highly experienced mountaineers There are two main climbing routes one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal known as the standard route and the other from the north in Tibet While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness weather and wind as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall As of May 2024 340 people have died on Everest Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions Climbers typically ascend only part of Mount Everests elevation as the mountains full elevation is measured from the geoid which approximates sea level The closest sea to Mount Everests summit is the Bay of Bengal almost 700 km 430 mi away To approximate a climb of the entire height of Mount Everest one would need to start from this coastline a feat accomplished by Tim MacartneySnapes team in 1990 Climbers usually begin their ascent from base camps above 5000 m 16404 ft The amount of elevation climbed from below these camps varies On the Tibetan side most climbers drive directly to the North Base Camp On the Nepalese side climbers generally fly into Kathmandu then Lukla and trek to the South Base Camp making the climb from Lukla to the summit about 6000 m 19685 ft in elevation gain The first recorded efforts to reach Everests summit were made by British mountaineers As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7000 m 22970 ft on the North Col the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8320 m 27300 ft marking the first time a human had climbed above 8000 m 26247 ft The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953 using the southeast ridge route Norgay had reached 8595 m 28199 ft the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou Gonpo and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on 25 May 1960 Name Mount Everests NepaliSanskrit name is Sagarmth IAST transcription or SagarMatha srmata lit goddess of the sky which means the head in the great blue sky being derived from sagar meaning sky and mth meaning head The Tibetan name for Everest is Qomolangma lit holy mother The name was first recorded in a Chinese transcription in the 1721 Kangxi Atlas issued during the reign of Qing Emperor Kangxi it first appeared in the West in 1733 as Tchoumour Lancma on a map prepared by the French geographer DAnville and based on Kangxi Atlas The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as Chomolungma and in Wylie as Jomoglangma The official Chinese transcription is t or Zhmlngm Fng in pinyin While other Chinese names have been used historically including Shngm Fng t s lit holy mother peak these names were largely phased out after the Chinese Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a decree to adopt a sole name in May 1952 The British geographic survey of 1849 attempted to preserve local names when possible eg Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri However Andrew Waugh the British Surveyor General of India claimed that he could not find a commonly used local name and that his search for one had been hampered by the Nepalese and Tibetan policy of exclusion of foreigners Waugh argued that because there were many local names it would be difficult to favour one name over all others he therefore decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest his predecessor as Surveyor General of India Everest himself opposed the honor and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that Everest could neither be written in Hindi nor pronounced by the native of India Despite Everests objections Waughs proposed name prevailed and the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted the name Mount Everest in 1865 The modern pronunciation of Everest is different from Sir Georges pronunciation of his surname EEVrist In the late 19th century many European cartographers incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was Gaurishankar a mountain between Kathmandu and Everest Other names Peak XV temporary assigned by British Imperial Survey Deodungha Old Darjeeling Gauri Shankar Gaurishankar or Gaurisankar misattribution used occasionally until about 1900 In modern times the name is used for a different peak about 30 miles 48 kilometres away Surveys 19th century In 1802 the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix the locations heights and names of the worlds highest mountains Starting in southern India the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites each weighing 500 kg 1100 lb and requiring 12 men to carry to measure heights as accurately as possible They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied The British were forced to continue their observations from Terai a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and malaria Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health Nonetheless in 1847 the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to 240 km 150 mi distant Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year In November 1847 Andrew Scott Waugh the British Surveyor General of India made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas Kangchenjunga was then considered the highest peak in the world and with interest he noted a peak beyond it about 230 km 140 mi away John Armstrong one of Waughs subordinates also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak b Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak b was higher than Kangchenjunga but closer observations were required for verification The following year Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak b but clouds thwarted his attempts In 1849 Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area who made two observations from Jirol 190 km 120 mi away Nicolson then took the largest theodolite and headed east obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations with the closest being 174 km 108 mi from the peak Nicolson retreated to Patna on the Ganges to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations His raw data gave an average height of 9200 m 30200 ft for peak b but this did not consider light refraction which distorts heights However the number clearly indicated that peak b was higher than Kangchenjunga Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations Michael Hennessy one of Waughs assistants had begun designating peaks based on Roman numerals with Kangchenjunga named Peak IX Peak b now became known as Peak XV In 1852 stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun Radhanath Sikdar an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the worlds highest peak using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolsons measurements An official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified Waugh began work on Nicolsons data in 1854 and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers having to deal with the problems of light refraction barometric pressure and temperature over the vast distances of the observations Finally in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8582 m 28156 ft while Peak XV was given the height of 8840 m 29002 ft Waugh concluded that Peak XV was most probably the highest in the world Peak XV measured in feet was calculated to be exactly 29000 ft 88392 m high but was publicly declared to be 29002 ft 88398 m in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29000 feet 88392 m was nothing more than a rounded estimate Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest 20th century In 1856 Andrew Waugh announced Everest then known as Peak XV as 8840 m 29002 ft high after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey From 1952 to 1954 the Survey of India using triangulation methods determined that the height of Everest was 884773 m 29028 ft In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 884813 m 2902930 ft In both cases the snow cap not the rock head was measured The 8848 m 29029 ft height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain In May 1999 an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock A rock head elevation of 8850 m 29035 ft and a snowice elevation 1 m 3 ft higher were obtained via this device Although as of 2001 it has not been officially recognised by Nepal this figure is widely quoted Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 see 21stcentury surveys surveys In 1955 a detailed photogrammetric map at a scale of 150000 of the Khumbu region including the south side of Mount Everest was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition which also attempted Lhotse In the late 1980s an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn using extensive aerial photography 21st century On 9 October 2005 after several months of measurement and calculation the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 884443 m 2901716 ft with accuracy of 021 m 83 in claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it The Chinese team measured a snowice depth of 35 m 11 ft which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8848 m 29029 ft An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height 8844 m China or the snow height 8848 m Nepal In 2010 both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8848 m and Nepal recognises Chinas claim that the rock height of Everest is 8844 m On 8 December 2020 it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 884886 metres 290317 ft It is thought that the plate tectonics of the Main Himalayan Thrust and related faults which form the convergent boundary between the Eurasian Plate and Indian Plate are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4 mm 016 in per year vertically and 3 to 6 mm 012 to 024 in per year horizontally but another account mentions more lateral movement 27 mm or 11 in and even shrinkage has been suggested Comparisons The summit of Everest is the point at which Earths surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the tallest mountains on Earth Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base it rises over 10200 m 334646 ft from its base on the midocean floor but only attains 4205 m 13796 ft above sea level By the same measure of base to summit Denali in Alaska formerly known as Mount McKinley is taller than Everest as well Despite its height above sea level of only 6190 m 20308 ft Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300 to 900 m 980 to 2950 ft yielding a height above base in the range of 5300 to 5900 m 17400 to 19400 ft a commonly quoted figure is 5600 m 18400 ft By comparison reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4200 m 13800 ft on the south side to 5200 m 17100 ft on the Tibetan Plateau yielding a height above base in the range of 3650 to 4650 m 11980 to 15260 ft The summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is 2168 m 7113 ft farther from Earths centre 63844 km 39671 mi than that of Everest 63823 km 39658 mi because the Earth bulges at the equator This is despite Chimborazo having a peak of 6268 m 205643 ft above sea level versus Mount Everests 8848 m 290289 ft Context and maps Nearby peaks include Lhotse 8516 m 27940 ft Nuptse 7855 m 25771 ft and Changtse 7580 m 24870 ft among others Another nearby peak is Khumbutse and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest On the southwest side a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps Geology Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations Each formation is separated from the other by lowangle faults called detachments along which they have been thrust southward over each other From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation the North Col Formation and the Rongbuk Formation The Qomolangma Formation also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band about 8600 m 28200 ft above sea level It consists of greyish to dark grey or white parallel laminated and bedded Ordovician limestone interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with argillaceous laminae and siltstone Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites crinoids and ostracods Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined A thick whiteweathering thrombolite bed that is 60 m 200 ft thick comprises the foot of the Third Step and base of the summit pyramid of Everest This bed which crops out starting about 70 m 230 ft below the summit of Mount Everest consists of sediments trapped bound and cemented by the biofilms of microorganisms especially cyanobacteria in shallow marine waters The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several highangle faults that terminate at the low angle normal fault the Qomolangma Detachment This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed The bulk of Mount Everest between 7000 and 8600 m 23000 and 28200 ft consists of the North Col Formation of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part between 8200 to 8600 m 26900 to 28200 ft The Yellow Band consists of intercalated beds of Middle Cambrian diopsideepidotebearing marble which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown and muscovitebiotite phyllite and semischist Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about 8300 m 27200 ft found it to consist as much as five per cent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed A 540 cm 20157 in thick fault breccia separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation The remainder of the North Col Formation exposed between 7000 to 8200 m 23000 to 26900 ft on Mount Everest consists of interlayered and deformed schist phyllite and minor marble Between 7600 and 8200 m 24900 and 26900 ft the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotitequartz phyllite and chloritebiotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotitesericitequartz schist Between 7000 and 7600 m 23000 and 24900 ft the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotitequartz schist intercalated with epidotequartz schist biotitecalcitequartz schist and thin layers of quartzose marble These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea flysch composed of interbedded mudstone shale clayey sandstone calcareous sandstone graywacke and sandy limestone The base of the North Col Formation is a regional lowangle normal fault called the Lhotse detachment Below 7000 m 23000 ft the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest It consists of sillimaniteKfeldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1 cm to 1500 m 04 in to 4900 ft These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late OligoceneMiocene intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician highgrade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate Mount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia Current interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it collided with Asia The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them southward and upward The Rongbuk Formation consists of a sequence of highgrade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived from the alteration of highgrade metasedimentary rocks During the collision of India with Asia these rocks were thrust downward and to the north as they were overridden by other strata heated metamorphosed and partially melted at depths of over 15 to 20 kilometres 93 to 124 mi below sea level and then forced upward to surface by thrusting towards the south between two major detachments Mount Everest is rising by about 2 mm per year IUGS geological heritage site In respect of the recognition of the highest rocks on the planet as fossiliferous marine limestone the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences IUGS in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022 The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as a key place with geological elements andor processes of international scientific relevance used as a reference andor with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history Flora and fauna There is very little native flora or fauna on Everest A type of moss grows at 6480 metres 21260 ft on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species An alpine cushion plant called Arenaria is known to grow below 5500 metres 18000 ft in the region According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018 vegetation is expanding in the Everest region Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare A minute black jumping spider of the genus Euophrys has been found at elevations as high as 6700 metres 22000 ft possibly making it the highest confirmed nonmicroscopic permanent resident on Earth Another Euophrys species E everestensis has been found at 5030 metres 16500 ft and may feed on insects that have been blown there by the wind There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes The barheaded goose migrates over the Himalayas and have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain In 1953 George Lowe part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary said that he saw barheaded geese flying over Everests summit Another bird species the chough have been spotted as high as the South Col at 7920 metres 25980 ft and yellowbilled choughs have been seen as high as 7900 metres 26000 ft Yaks are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs They can haul around 100 kg 220 pounds have thick fur and large lungs Other animals in the region include the Himalayan tahr which is sometimes the prey of the snow leopard The Himalayan black bear can be found up to about 4300 metres 14000 ft and the red panda is also present in the region One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants Conservation From the Nepalese side Everest is protected as part of Sagarmatha National Park while from the Chinese side the mountain is protected as part of Qomolangma National Nature Reserve Climate Mount Everest has an ice cap climate Kppen EF with all months averaging well below freezing Climate change The base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change making it unsafe for climbers As recommended by the committee formed by Nepals government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region Taranath Adhikarithe director general of Nepals tourism departmentsaid they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1 However the present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for three to four years The move may happen by 2024 per officials Meteorology In 2008 a new weather station at about 8000 m 26000 ft elevation went online The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment SHARE which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011 The solarpowered weather station is on the South Col Mount Everest extends into the upper troposphere and penetrates the stratosphere The air pressure at the summit is generally about onethird what it is at sea level The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream Winds commonly attain 160 kmh 100 mph in February 2004 a wind speed of 280 kmh 175 mph was recorded at the summit These winds can hamper or endanger climbers by blowing them into chasms or by Bernoullis principle by lowering the air pressure further reducing available oxygen by up to 14 percent To avoid the harshest winds climbers typically aim for a 7 to 10day window in the spring and fall when the Asian monsoon season is starting up or ending Mount Everest hosts several weather stations that collect important data on highaltitude weather conditions Among them is the Balcony Station the highest weather station on the planet located at about 8430 meters 27657 feet above sea level Set up by climate scientists Tom Matthews and Baker Perry in 2019 this station is positioned just below the summit of Everest which is the highest point on Earth As of January 20 2020 the Balcony Station ceased transmitting data Expeditions Because Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown It may have been climbed in 1924 although this has never been confirmed as neither of the men making the attempt returned Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain Everests summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953 and interest from climbers increased thereafter Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions only about 200 people had summited by 1987 Everest remained a difficult climb for decades even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s By March 2012 Everest had been climbed 5656 times with 223 deaths By 2013 The Himalayan Database recorded 6871 summits by 4042 different people Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 kmh 200 mph when the weather shifts At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north providing periods of relative calm at the mountain Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches Early attempts In 1885 Clinton Thomas Dent president of the Alpine Club suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book Above the Snow Line The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain With Mallory leading and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everests flanks they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7005 metres 22982 ft From there Mallory espied a route to the top but the party was unprepared to climb any further and descended The British returned for a 1922 expedition George Finch climbed using oxygen for the first time He ascended at a remarkable speed290 metres 951 ft per hourand reached an altitude of 8320 m 27300 ft the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8000 m Mallory and Col Felix Norton made a second unsuccessful attempt The next expedition was in 1924 The initial attempt by Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp VI The next attempt was that of Norton and Somervell who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather traversing the North Face into the Great Couloir Norton managed to reach 8550 m 28050 ft though he ascended only 30 m 98 ft or so in the last hour Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a lastditch effort He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner On 8 June 1924 George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made an attempt on the summit via the North ColNorth RidgeNortheast Ridge route from which they never returned On 1 May 1999 the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallorys body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp VI Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29 years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 In 1933 Lady Houston a British millionairess funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 which saw a formation of two aeroplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the Everest summit Early expeditionssuch as Charles Bruces in the 1920s and Hugh Ruttledges two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936tried to ascend the mountain from Tibet via the North Face Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet In 1950 Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston Oscar Houston and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south The 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition led by Edouard WyssDunant was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7986 m 26201 ft Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about 8595 m 28199 ft on the southeast ridge setting a new climbing altitude record Tenzings experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953 The Swiss decided to make another postmonsoon attempt in the autumn they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary 1953 In 1953 a ninth British expedition led by John Hunt returned to Nepal Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit The first pair Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans came within 100 m 330 ft of the summit on 26 May 1953 but turned back after running into oxygen problems As planned their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair Two days later the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay a Nepali Sherpa climber They reached the summit at 1130 am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route At the time both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending 1950s1960s On 23 May 1956 Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended This was followed by Dlf Reist and HansRudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957 Wang Fuzhou Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960 The first American to climb Everest Jim Whittaker joined by Nawang Gombu reached the summit on 1 May 1963 on the American Mount Everest expedition and on 22 May on the same expedition Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld were the first the traverse the mountain by climbing via the North Face and descending via the South Col 1970s In 1970 Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition The centrepiece was a large siegestyle expedition led by Saburo Matsukata working on finding a new route up the southwest face Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes However Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes For example Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Colhe descended nearly 1300 vertical metres 4200 ft from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route Miuras exploits became the subject of film and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80 In 1975 Junko Tabei became the first woman to summit Mount Everest The 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led and organised by Chris Bonington made the first ascent of the south west face of Everest from the Western Cwm The 1976 British and Nepalese Army Expedition to Everest led by Tony Streather put Bronco Lane and Brummy Stokes on the summit by the normal route In 1978 Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen 19791980 Winter Himalaism The Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest the first winter ascent of an eightthousander The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier in early January 1980 On 15 January the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea level but further action was stopped by hurricaneforce winds The weather improved after 11 February when Leszek Cichy Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col 7906 m Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 650 am on 17 February At 240 pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers voices over the radio We are on the summit The strong wind blows all the time It is unimaginably cold The successful winter ascent of Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism which became a Polish specialisation After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks which earned Polish climbers a reputation of Ice Warriors Lho La tragedy 1989 In May 1989 Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit On 24 May Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak starting from camp V at 8200 m overcame the ridge and reached the summit But on 27 May during an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass four Polish climbers were killed Mirosaw Dsal Mirosaw Gardzielewski Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wacaw Otrba The following day due to his injuries Chrobak also died Marciniak who was also injured was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part inter alia Reinhold Messner Elizabeth Hawley Carlos Carsolio and the US consul 1996 disaster On 10 and 11 May 1996 eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May During the 1996 season 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event and for a single season until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest Journalist Jon Krakauer on assignment from Outside magazine was in one of the affected guided parties and afterward published the bestseller Into Thin Air which related his experience Krakauer was critical of guide Anatoli Boukreev in his recollection of the expedition A year later Boukreev coauthored The Climb in part as a rebuttal of Krakauers portrayal The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community Boukreev was later awarded The American Alpine Clubs David Sowles Award for his rescue efforts on the expedition In May 2004 physicist Kent Moore and surgeon John L Semple both researchers from the University of Toronto told New Scientist magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge about 14 per cent One of the survivors was Beck Weathers left for dead about 275 metres 900 feet from Camp 4 at 7950 metres 26085 feet After spending a night on the mountain Weathers managed to make it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness When he arrived at Camp 4 fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight Weathers was lowered to Camp 2 and eventually a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the Nepali Army The storms impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest where several climbers also died was detailed in a firsthand account by British filmmaker and writer Matt Dickinson in his book The Other Side of Everest Sixteenyearold Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account Within Reach My Everest Story The 2015 feature film Everest directed by Baltasar Kormkur is based on the events of this guiding disaster 2006 mountaineering season In 2006 12 people died One death in particular see below triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics The season was also remembered for the rescue of Lincoln Hall who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain David Sharp ethics controversy 2006 There was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber David Sharp who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media with a series of interviews allegations and critiques The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal He went with a lowbudget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp after which climbers go as a loose group offering a high degree of independence The manager at Sharps guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble and if they did know whether they were qualified or capable of helping him Doubleamputee climber Mark Inglis said in an interview that on 15 May his climbing party and many others had passed Sharp sheltering under a rock overhang 450 metres 1480 ft below the summit without attempting a rescue Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed Green Boots but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down a Turkish woman Burak Poan There has also been some discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp In regard to Ingliss initial comments he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was physically and mentally exhausted and in a lot of pain He had suffered severe frostbite he later had five fingertips amputated It was estimated that Sharp summited Mount Everest on 14 May and began his descent down but on 15 May he was in trouble and being passed by climbers on their way up and down It is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 300 m 1000 ft from the summit on the North Side route Dawa from Arun Treks also gave oxygen to David and tried to help him move repeatedly for perhaps an hour But he could not get David to stand alone or even stand to rest on his shoulders and crying Dawa had to leave him too Even with two Sherpas it was not going to be possible to get David down the tricky sections below The Tribune of Chandigarh India quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering In addition to Sharps death at least nine other climbers perished that year including multiple Sherpas working for various guiding companies Much of this controversy was captured by the Discovery Channel while filming the television program Everest Beyond the Limit A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp is shown in the program where an early returning climber Lebanese adventurer Maxim Chaya is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager Russell Brice that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress Chaya is unable to identify Sharp who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself As Sharps condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him his opportunities for rescue diminish his legs and feet curl from frostbite preventing him from walking the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him David Sharps body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to Green Boots they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them Sharps body was removed from the cave in 2007 according to the BBC and since 2014 Green Boots has been missing presumably removed or buried Lincoln Hall rescue 2006 As the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006 Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left for dead the day before He was found by a party of four climbers Dan Mazur Andrew Brash Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa who giving up their own summit attempt stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down Hall later fully recovered His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema and they were instructed to cover him with rocks There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family The next day he was discovered alive by another party 2007 On 21 May 2007 Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful highaltitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista Major McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal Ascent statistics up to 2010 season By the end of the 2010 climbing season there had been 5104 ascents to the summit by about 3142 individuals with 77 per cent of these ascents being accomplished since 2000 The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014 In 2007 the record number of 633 ascents was recorded by 350 climbers and 253 sherpas An illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers 33 to 36 attempting to summit on the same day this was considered unusually high at the time By comparison on 23 May 2010 the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers more summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 through 1983 There have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition through the end of 2010 a rate of 43 fatalities for every 100 summits this is a general rate and includes fatalities amongst support climbers those who turned back before the peak those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak Of the 219 fatalities 58 265 per cent were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 14 fatalities for every 100 summits with 3938 summits since 2000 the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000 33 on the northeast ridge 17 on the southeast ridge 2 on the southwest face and 2 on the north face Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year In 200507 more than half of all climbers elected to use the more challenging but cheaper northeast route In 2008 the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for carrying the Olympic torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics The route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the runup to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lamas exile These closures led to declining interest in the north route and in 2010 twothirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south 2010s The 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain with backtoback disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades However other years set records for numbers of summits 2013s record number of summiters around 667 was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters 2014 avalanche and season On 18 April 2014 an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2 Sixteen people were killed all Nepali guides and nine more were injured In response to the tragedy numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss During the season 13yearold Malavath Purna reached the summit becoming the youngest female climber to do so One team used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall then reached the Everest summit This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb A team member Jing Wang donated US30000 to a local hospital She was named the Nepali International Mountaineer of the Year Over 100 people summited Everest from China Tibet region and six from Nepal in the 2014 season This included 72yearold Bill Burke the Indian teenage girl and a Chinese woman Jing Wang Another teen girl summiter was Ming Kipa Sherpa who summited with her elder sister Lhakpa Sherpa in 2003 and who had achieved the most times for woman to the summit of Mount Everest at that time see also Santosh Yadav 2015 avalanche earthquake season 2015 was set to be a recordbreaking season of climbs with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet China However on 25 April 2015 an earthquake measuring 78 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season 18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team The avalanche began on Pumori moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Mount Everest and slammed into the South Base Camp 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks over 50 per cent according to the United States Geological Survey Just weeks after the first quake the region was rattled again by a 73 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks The quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies The quake shifted the route through the ice fall making it essentially impassable to climbers Bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult The Everest tragedy was small compared to the impact overall on Nepal with almost nine thousand dead and about 22000 injured In Tibet by 28 April at least 25 had died and 117 were injured By 29 April 2015 the Tibet Mountaineering Association NorthChinese side closed Everest and other peaks to climbing stranding 25 teams and about 300 people on the north side of Everest On the south side helicopters evacuated 180 people trapped at Camps 1 and 2 On 24 August 2015 Nepal reopened Everest to tourism including mountain climbers The only climber permit for the autumn season was awarded to Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki who had tried four times previously to summit Everest without success He made his fifth attempt in October but had to give up just 700 m 2300 ft from the summit due to strong winds and deep snow Some sections of the trail from Lukla to Everest Base Camp Nepal were damaged in the earthquakes earlier in the year and needed repairs to handle trekkers 2016 season Hawleys database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016 2017 season 2017 was the biggest season yet permitwise yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths On 27 May 2017 Kami Rita made his 21st climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition one of three people in the World along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit of Mount Everest 21 times The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck of Switzerland who died from a fall during a warmup climb There was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the Hillary Step Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648 449 summited via Nepal from the South and 120 from Chinese Tibet North side 2018 807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018 including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet side This broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013 and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season Various records were broken including a summit by doubleamputee Xia Boyu who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the Nepali Supreme Court There were no major disasters but seven climbers including sherpas as well as international climbers died in various situations Although record numbers of climbers reached the summit oldtime summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding feces and cost Figures for the number of permits issued by Nepal range from 347 to 375 2019 The spring or premonsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of a number of climbers Worldwide publication of images of hundreds of mountaineers queuing to reach the summit and sensational media reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world There were reports of various winter expeditions in the Himalayas including K2 Nanga Parbat and Meru with the buzz for the Everest 2019 beginning just 14 weeks to the weather window Noted climber Cory Richards announced on Twitter that he was hoping to establish a new climbing route to the summit in 2019 Also announced was an expedition to remeasure the height of Everest particularly in light of the 2015 earthquakes China closed the basecamp to those without climbing permits in February 2019 on the northern side of Mount Everest By early April climbing teams from around the world were arriving for the 2019 spring climbing season Among the teams was a scientific expedition with a planned study of pollution and how things like snow and vegetation influence the availability of food and water in the region In the 2019 spring mountaineering season there were roughly 40 teams with almost 400 climbers and several hundred guides attempting to summit on the Nepali side Nepal issued 381 climbing permits for 2019 For the northern routes in Chinese Tibet several hundred more permits were issued for climbing by authorities there In May 2019 Nepali mountaineering guide Kami Rita summited Mount Everest twice within a week his 23rd and 24th ascents making international news headlines He first summited Everest in 1994 and has summited several other extremely high mountains such as K2 and Lhotse By 23 May 2019 about seven people had died possibly due to crowding leading to delays high on the mountain and shorter weather windows One 19yearold who summited previously noted that when the weather window opens long lines form as everyone rushes to get the top and back down In Chinese Tibet one Austrian climber died from a fall and by 26 May 2019 the overall number of deaths for the spring climbing season rose to 10 By 28 May the death toll increased to 11 when a climber died at about 7900 m 26000 ft during the descent and a 12th climber missing and presumed dead Despite the number of deaths reports indicated that a record 891 climbers summited in the spring 2019 climbing season Although China has had various permit restrictions and Nepal requires a doctor to sign off on climbing permits the natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with medical issues aggravated by Everests extreme altitude led to 2019 being a year with a comparatively high death toll 2020s Both Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020 season due to the COVID19 pandemic 2020 was the third year in this decade after 2014 and 2015 which saw no summits from the Nepal South Side A team of Chinese surveyors climbed Mt Everest from the North side during AprilMay 2020 becoming the only climbers to summit the worlds highest peak during the pandemic at least through May The team was there to remeasure the height of Mount Everest On 12 May 2022 the first allBlack team summited Mt Everest Seven men and two women climbers from the US and Kenya guided by eight sherpas comprised the expedition Climbing Permits In 2014 Nepal issued 334 climbing permits which were extended until 2019 due to the closure In 2015 Nepal issued 357 permits but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake and these permits were given a twoyear extension to 2017 In 2017 a person who tried to climb Everest without the 11000 permit was caught after he made it past the Khumbu icefall He faced among other penalties a 22000 fine and a possible four years in jail In the end he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years The number of permits issued each year by Nepal is 2008 160 2009 220 2010 209 2011 225 2012 208 2013 316 2014 326 extended for use through 2019 2015 356 extended for use through 2017 2016 289 2017 366 to 373 2018 346 2019 381 2020 0 no permits issued during the pandemic 2021 408 current record The Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest They did not issue permits in 2008 due to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest In March 2020 the governments of China and Nepal cancelled all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the COVID19 pandemic In April 2020 a group of Chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the Chinese side The mountain remained closed on the Chinese side to all foreign climbers On 10 May 2021 a separation line was announced by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of coronavirus from climbers ascending Nepals side Commercial climbing According to Jon Krakauer the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985 when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass a wealthy 55yearold businessman and an amateur mountain climber with four years of climbing experience By the early1990s several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain Rob Hall one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident 24 42 By 2016 most guiding services cost between US35000 and US200000 Going with a celebrity guide usually a wellknown mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits can cost over 100000 as of 2015 However the services offered vary widely and it is buyer beware when doing deals in Nepal one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world Tourism contributed 79 per cent of the gross domestic product GDP in 2019 in a country with high unemployment but an Everest porter can make nearly double the nations average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking Costs beyond the guiding service can vary widely It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses and there are budget travel agencies that offer logistical support for such trips A limited support service offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit can cost as little as US7000 as of 2007 However this is considered difficult and dangerous as illustrated by the case of David Sharp Climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US8000 and most climbers also use bottled oxygen which adds around US3000 The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US10000 to US30000 per person depending on the size of the team The ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain both of which are approximately 100 kilometres 60 mi from Kathmandu and 300 kilometres 190 mi from Lhasa the two nearest cities with major airports Transferring ones equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US2000 Many climbers hire full service guide companies which provide a wide spectrum of services including the acquisition of permits transportation tofrom base camp food tents fixed ropes medical assistance while on the mountain an experienced mountaineer guide and even personal porters to carry ones backpack and cook ones meals The cost of such a guide service may range from US40000 to 80000 per person Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas clients of fullservice guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under 10 kilograms 22 lb or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them By contrast climbers attempting less commercialised peaks like Denali are often expected to carry backpacks over 30 kilograms 66 lb and occasionally to tow a sled with 35 kilograms 77 lb of gear and food The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism Jamling Tenzing Norgay the son of Tenzing Norgay said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrillseekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet But the spirit of adventure is not there any more It is lost There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on crampons They are climbing because they have paid someone 65000 It is very selfish It endangers the lives of others One example of this is Shriya ShahKlorfine who had to be taught how to put on crampons during her summit attempt in 2012 She paid at least US40000 to a new guiding company for the trip and died when she ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours straight Reinhold Messner concurred in 2004 You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself We were real mountaineers careful aware and even afraid By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were We were finding out how breakable how weak and how full of fear we are You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountainHigh altitude alpinism has become tourism and show These commercial trips to Everest they are still dangerous But the guides and organisers tell clients Dont worry its all organised The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas Extra oxygen is available in all camps right up to the summit People will cook for you and lay out your beds Clients feel safe and dont care about the risks By 2015 Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some experience hoping this would both make the mountain safer and increase revenue One barrier to this is that lowbudget firms make money not taking inexperienced climbers to the summit Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a pricethat they return home soon after arriving after base camp or part way up the mountain However not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers have been strictly negative For example Edmund Hillary stated in 2003 that while Having people pay 65000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guidesisnt really mountaineering at all he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners I dont have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people When we first went in there they didnt have any schools they didnt have any medical facilities all over the years we have established 27 schools we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then weve built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas weve done a lot to benefit them One of the early guided summiters Richard Bass of Seven Summits fame stated in 2003 that Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains People dont realise the difference between a 20000foot 6100 m mountain and 29000foot 8800 m Its not just arithmetic The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright but the effect on the human body is disproportionatean exponential curve People climb Denali 6190 m or 20320 ft or Aconcagua 6960 m or 22834 ft and think Heck I feel great up here Im going to try Everest But its not like that Routes Mount Everest has two main climbing routes the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet as well as many other less frequently climbed routes Of the two main routes the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996 This was however a route decision dictated more by politics than by design as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s after the Peoples Republic of China invaded Tibet Most attempts are made during May before the summer monsoon season As the monsoon season approaches the jet stream shifts northward thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain While attempts are sometimes made in September and October after the monsoons when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons tail end makes climbing extremely difficult Southeast ridge The ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5380 m 17700 ft on the south side of Everest in Nepal Expeditions usually fly into Lukla 2860 m from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar Climbers then hike to Base Camp which usually takes six to eight days allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks dzopkyos yakcow hybrids and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953 the British expedition they were part of comprising over 400 climbers porters and Sherpas at that point started from the Kathmandu Valley as there were no roads further east at that time Climbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp acclimatising to the altitude During that time Sherpas and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall Seracs crevasses and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section To reduce the hazard climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place Above the icefall is Camp I at 6065 metres 19900 ft From Camp I climbers make their way up the Western Cwm to the base of the Lhotse face where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp ABC is established at 6500 m 21300 ft The Western Cwm is a flat gently rising glacial valley marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm Climbers are forced to cross on the far right near the base of Nuptse to a small passageway known as the Nuptse corner The Western Cwm is also called the Valley of Silence as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route The high altitude and a clear windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers From Camp II climbers ascend the Lhotse face on fixed ropes up to Camp III located on a small ledge at 7470 m 24500 ft From there it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the South Col at 7920 m 26000 ft From Camp III to Camp IV climbers are faced with two additional challenges the Geneva Spur and the Yellow Band The Geneva Spur is an anvilshaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snowcovered rock band The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble phyllite and semischist which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it On the South Col climbers enter the death zone Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude If the weather is not clear with low winds during these short few days climbers are forced to descend many all the way back down to Base Camp From Camp IV climbers begin their summit push around midnight with hopes of reaching the summit still another 1000 metres above within 10 to 12 hours Climbers first reach The Balcony at 8400 m 27600 ft a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn Continuing up the ridge climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waistdeep snow a serious avalanche hazard At 8750 m 28700 ft a small tablesized dome of ice and snow marks the South Summit From the South Summit climbers follow the knifeedge southeast ridge along what is known as the Cornice traverse where snow clings to intermittent rock This is the most exposed section of the climb and a misstep to the left would send one 2400 m 7900 ft down the southwest face while to the immediate right is the 3050 m 10010 ft Kangshung Face At the end of this traverse is an imposing 12 m 39 ft rock wall the Hillary Step at 8790 m 28840 ft Hillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step and they did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes Nowadays climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas Once above the step it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopesthough the exposure on the ridge is extreme especially while traversing large cornices of snow With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent years the Step has frequently become a bottleneck with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain After the Hillary Step climbers also must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out North ridge route The north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest in Tibet Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier setting up base camp at 5180 m 16990 ft on a gravel plain just below the glacier To reach Camp II climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse at around 6100 m 20000 ft Camp III ABC Advanced Base Camp is situated below the North Col at 6500 m 21300 ft To reach Camp IV on the North Col climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at 7010 m 23000 ft From the North Col climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around 7775 m 25500 ft The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band reaching the site of Camp VI at 8230 m 27000 ft From Camp VI climbers make their final summit push Climbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step ascending from 8501 to 8534 m 27890 to 28000 ft to the crux of the climb the Second Step ascending from 8577 to 8626 m 28140 to 28300 ft The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the Chinese ladder a metal ladder placed semipermanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers It has been almost continuously in place since and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over ascending from 8690 to 8800 m 28510 to 28870 ft Once above these steps the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached Summit The summit of Everest has been described as the size of a dining room table The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock and the layer of snow varies from year to year The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a lowgrade metamorphic rock See the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit Below the summit there is an area known as rainbow valley filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear Down to about 8000 m 26000 ft is an area commonly called the death zone due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure Below the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides or faces of Mount Everest the North Face the SouthWest Face and the EastKangshung Face Death zone At the higher regions of Mount Everest climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone altitudes higher than 8000 metres 26000 ft and face significant challenges to survival Temperatures can dip to very low levels resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air Since temperatures are so low snow is wellfrozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers Another significant threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or 0333 standard atmospheres 337 mbar resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe Debilitating effects of the death zone are so great that it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 172 kilometres 107 mi from South Col to the summit Achieving even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude acclimatisation which takes 4060 days for a typical expedition A sealevel dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above 8500 m 27900 ft without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within two to three minutes In May 2007 the Caudwell Xtreme Everest undertook a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests were performed to examine blood oxygen levels A small team also performed tests on the way to the summit Even at base camp the low partial pressure of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels At sea level blood oxygen saturation is generally 98 to 99 per cent At base camp blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87 per cent Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate often 8090 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 2030 Exhaustion can occur merely by attempting to breathe Lack of oxygen exhaustion extreme cold and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky People who die during the climb are typically left behind As of 2015 over 200 bodies remain on the mountain Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest Profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early features associated with subsequent death A 2008 study noted that the death zone is indeed where most Everest deaths occur but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit A 2014 article in The Atlantic about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes Despite this Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements but it depends on the period Some examples are Kangchenjunga K2 Annapurna Nanga Parbat and the Eiger especially the nordwand Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain the skill of those climbing and the difficulty of the climb Another health hazard is retinal haemorrhages which can damage eyesight and cause blindness Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes in 2010 a climber went blind and died in the death zone At one oclock in the afternoon the British climber Peter Kinloch was on the roof of the world in bright sunlight taking photographs of the Himalayas below elated cheery and bubbly But Mount Everest is now his grave because only minutes later he suddenly went blind and had to be abandoned to die from the cold The team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain but to no avail as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections Even for the able the Everest NorthEast ridge is recognised as a challenge It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save anyone in such a difficult spot One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011 who had intended to paraglide off the summit They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies They successfully launched off the summit and paraglided down to Namche Bazaar in just 42 minutes without having to climb down the mountain Supplemental oxygen Most expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above 8000 m 26000 ft Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk Humans ability to think clearly is hindered with low oxygen and the combination of extreme weather low temperatures and steep slopes often requires quick accurate decisions While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen Travelling above 2400 m 8000 ft altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition by George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce who climbed up to 7800 m 25600 ft at a spectacular speed of 300 vertical metres 1000 ft per hour Pinned down by a fierce storm they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a juryrigged setup during the night The next day they climbed to 8100 m 26600 ft at 270 mh 900 fth nearly three times as fast as nonoxygen users Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate George Mallory described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924 When Tenzing and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953 they also used opencircuit bottled oxygen sets with the expeditions physiologist Griffith Pugh referring to the oxygen debate as a futile controversy noting that oxygen greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing For the next twentyfive years bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function Reinhold Messner was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978 with Peter Habeler made the first successful climb without it In 1980 Messner summited the mountain solo without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners on the more difficult northwest route Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it should be climbed 154 The aftermath of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate Jon Krakauers Into Thin Air 1997 expressed the authors personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit leading to dangerous situations and more deaths The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers 34 on that day attempting to ascend causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers most of whom summited after the usual 1400 turnaround time He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everestmany bottles have accumulated on its slopesand keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain The 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guides role in using bottled oxygen Guide Anatoli Boukreevs decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer Boukreevs supporters who include G Weston DeWalt who cowrote The Climb state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security Krakauer and his supporters point out that without bottled oxygen Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend The low oxygen can cause a mental foglike impairment of cognitive abilities described as delayed and lethargic thought process clinically defined as bradypsychia even after returning to lower altitudes In severe cases climbers can experience hallucinations Some studies have found that highaltitude climbers including Everest climbers experience altered brain structure The effects of high altitude on the brain particularly if it can cause permanent brain damage continue to be studied Autumn climbing Although generally less popular than spring Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn also called the postmonsoon season For example in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years The autumn season when the monsoon ends is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable However this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973 Chris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the Los Angeles Times By the 21st century summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest During the 1980s climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring US astronaut Karl Gordon Henize died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition conducting an experiment on radiation The amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes The mountain has also been climbed in the winter but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days By January the peak is typically battered by 170 mph 270 kmh winds and the average temperature of the summit is around 33 F 36 C Thefts and crime Some climbers have reported lifethreatening thefts from supply caches In May 2006 Vitor Negrete the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharps party died during his descent and theft of gear and food from his highaltitude camp may have contributed In addition to theft Michael Kodas describes in his book High Crimes The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed 2008 unethical guides and Sherpas prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as out of control in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa Another Sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles which can be worth hundreds of dollars each Hundreds of climbers pass by peoples tents making it hard to safeguard against theft In the late 2010s the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common Selected climbing records By the end of the 2010 climbing season there had been 5104 ascents to the summit by about 3142 individuals Some notable firsts by climbers include 1922 First climb to 8000 metres 26247 ft by George Finch and Captain Geoffrey Bruce 1952 First climb to South Col by 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition 1953 First ascent by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary on 1953 British Mount Everest expedition 1960 First reported ascent from the North Ridge by Wang Fuzhou Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China 1975 First female ascent by Junko Tabei 16 May 1975 First female ascent from the North Ridge by Phanthog deputy head of the second Chinese Everest expedition that sent nine climbers to the summit 27 May 1978 First ascent without supplemental oxygen by Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler 1978 First solo ascent by Franz Oppurg 1980 First winter ascent by Polish National Expedition Winter 19791980 Leszek Cichy and Krzysztof Wielicki 1980 Second solo ascent and the first without supplemental oxygen by Reinhold Messner 1981 Third solo ascent by Peter Hackett 1988 First crossover climb by Chinese Japanese and Nepali teams which ascended the peak simultaneously from both the North and South sides of the mountain and descended down the other side The crossover climb was also the first to be recorded on live broadcast television 1988 First descent by paraglider by JeanMarc Boivin 1988 First female ascent without

summit Summiting with disabilities Summiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013 A teenager with Down syndrome made it to Base camp which has become a substitute for more extreme recordbreaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery Danger lurks even at base camp though which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis no legs Hari Budha Magar no legs Paul Hockey one arm only and Arunima Sinha one leg only In 2001 Erik Weihenmayer became the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest while blind Aviation 1933 Flight over Everest Lucy Lady Houston a British millionaire former showgirl funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain 1988 First climb and glide On 26 September 1988 having climbed the mountain via the southeast ridge JeanMarc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight Boivin said I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail and to run at this altitude was quite hard Boivin ran 18 m 60 ft from below the summit on 40degree slopes to launch his paraglider reaching Camp II at 5900 m 19400 ft in 12 minutes some sources say 11 minutes Boivin would not repeat this feat as he was killed two years later in 1990 BASE jumping off Venezuelas Angel Falls 1991 Hot air balloon flyover In 1991 four men in two balloons achieved the first hotair balloon flight over Mount Everest In one balloon were Andy Elson and Eric Jones cameraman and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson cameraman Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called Ballooning Over Everest The hotair balloons were modified to function at up to 12000 m 40000 ft altitude Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinsons panoramic views of Everest captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film the best snap on Earth according to UK newspaper The Telegraph Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US26 million per passenger 2005 Pilot summits with helicopter In May 2005 pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest He needed to land for two minutes to set the Fdration Aronautique Internationale FAI official record but he stayed for about four minutes twice In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft The flight set rotorcraft world records for highest of both landing and takeoff Some press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at 4880 m 16000 ft while he was there One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue 2011 Paraglide off summit On 21 May 2011 Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Bapu Sunuwar paraglided from Everests summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes After the flight they hiked biked and kayaked to the Indian Ocean reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011 thereby becoming the first persons to complete a continuous summittosea descent from Everest They accomplished the groundbreaking feat despite Bapu having never previously climbed and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program Nightline 2014 Helicopterassisted ascent In 2014 a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp II to avoid the Khumbu Icefall and thence climbed to the Everest summit This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb Nepal ended up investigating Wang who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp II admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp over the Khumbu Icefall In August 2014 however she stated that she had flown to Camp II because the icefall was impassable If you dont fly to Camp II you just go home she said in an interview In that same interview she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact Her team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb Ultimately the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepals interests allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and providing the opportunity for a new hybrid aviationmountaineering style triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US30000 to the towns hospital Wang won the International Mountaineer of the Year Award from the Nepal government in June 2014 2016 Helicopter business increases In 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014 the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain so this was then implemented in 2016 helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though That summer Bell tested the 412EPI which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 5500 m 18000 ft and flying as high as 6100 m 20000 ft altitude near Mount Everest Extreme sports Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering including snowboarding skiing paragliding and BASE jumping Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s He descended nearly 1300 vertical metres 4200 ft from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001 Other Everest skiers include Davo Karniar of Slovenia who completed a top to south base camp descent in 2000 Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006 In 2006 Swede Tomas Olsson and Norwegian Tormod Granheim skied together down the north face Olssons anchor broke while they were rappelling down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8500 metres resulting in his death from a two and a halfkilometre fall Granheim skied down to camp III Also Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snowboarding expedition Various types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps In 1986 Steve McKinney led an expedition to Mount Everest during which he became the first person to fly a hangglider off the mountain Frenchman JeanMarc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988 descending in minutes from the southeast ridge to a lower camp In 2011 two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down 5000 metres 16400 ft in 45 minutes On 5 May 2013 the beverage company Red Bull sponsored Valery Rozov who successfully BASE jumped off of the mountain while wearing a wingsuit setting a record for worlds highest BASE jump in the process Religious significance The southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several hidden valleys of refuge designated by Padmasambhava a ninthcentury lotusborn Buddhist saint Near the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery which has been called the sacred threshold to Mount Everest with the most dramatic views of the world For Sherpas living on the slopes of Everest in the Khumbu region of Nepal Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La Miyolangsangma a Tibetan Buddhist Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving is believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest According to Sherpa Buddhist monks Mount Everest is Miyolangsangmas palace and playground and all climbers are only partially welcome guests having arrived without invitation The Sherpa people also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape Here the karmic effects of ones actions are magnified and impure thoughts are best avoided Waste management In 2015 the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution especially human waste has reached critical levels As much as 12000 kg 26500 lb of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everests south side minefields of human excrement Climbers above Base Campfor the 62year history of climbing on the mountainhave most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow or slung it into crevasses or simply defecated wherever convenient often within metres of their tents The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp At approximately 5500 m 18000 ft Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there In the late1990s expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 190litre 50USgallon barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste spent oxygen tanks abandoned tents empty cans and bottles The Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain In February 2019 due to the mounting waste problem China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits Tourists are allowed to go as far as the Rongbuk Monastery In April 2019 the Solukhumbu districts Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10000 kg of garbage from Everest Five years later 2024 waste removal is receiving continuing attention

    title: "Democracy",
    originalContent:
      "Democracy from Ancient Greek romanized dmokrata dmos people and kratos rule is a system of government in which state power is vested in the people or the general population of a state Under a minimalist definition of democracy rulers are elected through competitive elections while more expansive definitions link democracy to guarantees of civil liberties and human rights in addition to competitive elections In a direct democracy the people have the direct authority to deliberate and decide legislation In a representative democracy the people choose governing officials through elections to do so The definition of the people and the ways authority is shared among them or delegated by them have changed over time and at varying rates in different countries Features of democracy oftentimes include freedom of assembly association personal property freedom of religion and speech citizenship consent of the governed voting rights freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty and minority rights The notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time Throughout history one can find evidence of direct democracy in which communities make decisions through popular assembly Today the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy Most democracies apply in most cases majority rule but in some cases plurality rule supermajority rule or consensus rule are applied They serve the crucial purpose of inclusiveness and broader legitimacy on sensitive issuescounterbalancing majoritarianismand therefore mostly take precedence on a constitutional level In the common variant of liberal democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minorityusually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights such as freedom of speech or freedom of association The term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek citystates notably Classical Athens to mean rule of the people in contrast to aristocracy aristokrata meaning rule of an elite Western democracy as distinct from that which existed in antiquity is generally considered to have originated in citystates such as those in Classical Athens and the Roman Republic where various degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class which was later extended to all adult citizens In most modern democracies this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state such as authoritarian systems World public opinion strongly favors democratic systems of government According to the VDem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index less than half the worlds population lives in a democracy as of 2022 Characteristics Although democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy Karl Popper says that the classical view of democracy is in brief the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule One study identified 2234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language Democratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes For example in a representative democracy every vote has in theory equal weight and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution while other uses of democracy may encompass direct democracy in which citizens vote on issues directly According to the United Nations democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised One theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles upward control sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority political equality and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality Legal equality political freedom and rule of law are often identified by commentators as foundational characteristics for a wellfunctioning democracy In some countries notably in the United Kingdom which originated the Westminster system the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty while maintaining judicial independence In India parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review Though the term democracy is typically used in the context of a political state the principles also are potentially applicable to private organisations such as clubs societies and firms Democracies may use many different decisionmaking methods but majority rule is the dominant form Without compensation like legal protections of individual or group rights political minorities can be oppressed by the tyranny of the majority Majority rule involves a competitive approach opposed to consensus democracy creating the need that elections and generally deliberation be substantively and procedurally fair ie just and equitable In some countries freedom of political expression freedom of speech and freedom of the press are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed enabling them to vote according to their own interests and beliefs It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters democracy can also be characterised as a form of political collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking Republics though often popularly associated with democracy because of the shared principle of rule by consent of the governed are not necessarily democracies as republicanism does not specify how the people are to rule Classically the term republic encompassed both democracies and aristocracies In a modern sense the republican form of government is a form of government without a monarch Because of this democracies can be republics or constitutional monarchies such as the United Kingdom History Democratic assemblies are as old as the human species and are found throughout human history but up until the nineteenth century major political figures have largely opposed democracy Republican theorists linked democracy to small size as political units grew in size the likelihood increased that the government would turn despotic At the same time small political units were vulnerable to conquest Montesquieu wrote If a republic be small it is destroyed by a foreign force if it is large it is ruined by an internal imperfection According to Johns Hopkins University political scientist Daniel Deudney the creation of the United States with its large size and its system of checks and balances was a solution to the dual problems of size Forms of democracy occurred organically in societies around the world that had no contact with each other Origins Greece and Rome The term democracy first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the citystate of Athens during classical antiquity The word comes from dmos common people and krtos forcemight Under Cleisthenes what is generally held as the first example of a type of democracy in 508507 BC was established in Athens Cleisthenes is referred to as the father of Athenian democracy The first attested use of the word democracy is found in prose works of the 430s BC such as Herodotus Histories but its usage was older by several decades as two Athenians born in the 470s were named Democrates a new political namelikely in support of democracygiven at a time of debates over constitutional issues in Athens Aeschylus also strongly alludes to the word in his play The Suppliants staged in c463 BC where he mentions the demoss ruling hand demou kratousa cheir Before that time the word used to define the new political system of Cleisthenes was probably isonomia meaning political equality Athenian democracy took the form of direct democracy and it had two distinguishing features the random selection of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices and a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens All eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly which set the laws of the citystate However Athenian citizenship excluded women slaves foreigners mtoikoi and youths below the age of military service Effectively only 1 in 4 residents in Athens qualified as citizens Owning land was not a requirement for citizenship The exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship In most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns Athenian democracy was not only direct in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people but also the most direct in the sense that the people through the assembly boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense the ancient Greeks had no word for rights those who were citizens of Athens enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person Range voting appeared in Sparta as early as 700 BC The Spartan ecclesia was an assembly of the people held once a month in which every male citizen of at least 20 years of age could participate In the assembly Spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting the vote is then decided on how loudly the crowd shouts Aristotle called this childish as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the Athenian citizenry Sparta adopted it because of its simplicity and to prevent any biased voting buying or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections Even though the Roman Republic contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of weighted voting so most high officials including members of the Senate came from a few wealthy and noble families In addition the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom was the first case in the Western world of a polity being formed with the explicit purpose of being a republic although it didnt have much of a democracy The Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries Ancient India Vaishali capital city of the Vajjika League Vrijji mahajanapada of India is considered one of the first examples of a republic around the 6th century BC Americas Other cultures such as the Iroquois in the Americas also developed a form of democratic society between 1450 and 1660 and possibly in 1142 well before contact with the Europeans This democracy continues to the present day and is the worlds oldest standing representative democracy Africa Middle Ages While most regions in Europe during the Middle Ages were ruled by clergy or feudal lords there existed various systems involving elections or assemblies although often only involving a small part of the population In Scandinavia bodies known as things consisted of freemen presided by a lawspeaker These deliberative bodies were responsible for settling political questions and variants included the Althing in Iceland and the Lgting in the Faeroe Islands The veche found in Eastern Europe was a similar body to the Scandinavian thing In the Roman Catholic Church the pope has been elected by a papal conclave composed of cardinals since 1059 The first documented parliamentary body in Europe was the Cortes of Len Established by Alfonso IX in 1188 the Cortes had authority over setting taxation foreign affairs and legislating though the exact nature of its role remains disputed The Republic of Ragusa established in 1358 and centered around the city of Dubrovnik provided representation and voting rights to its male aristocracy only Various Italian citystates and polities had republic forms of government For instance the Republic of Florence established in 1115 was led by the Signoria whose members were chosen by sortition In the 10th15th century Frisia a distinctly nonfeudal society the right to vote on local matters and on county officials was based on land size The Kouroukan Fouga divided the Mali Empire into ruling clans lineages that were represented at a great assembly called the Gbara However the charter made Mali more similar to a constitutional monarchy than a democratic republic The Parliament of England had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into Magna Carta 1215 which explicitly protected certain rights of the Kings subjects and implicitly supported what became the English writ of habeas corpus safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with the right to appeal The first representative national assembly in England was Simon de Montforts Parliament in 1265 The emergence of petitioning is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people However the power to call parliament remained at the pleasure of the monarch Studies have linked the emergence of parliamentary institutions in Europe during the medieval period to urban agglomeration and the creation of new classes such as artisans as well as the presence of nobility and religious elites Scholars have also linked the emergence of representative government to Europes relative political fragmentation Political scientist David Stasavage links the fragmentation of Europe and its subsequent democratization to the manner in which the Roman Empire collapsed Roman territory was conquered by small fragmented groups of Germanic tribes thus leading to the creation of small political units where rulers were relatively weak and needed the consent of the governed to ward off foreign threats In Poland noble democracy was characterized by an increase in the activity of the middle nobility which wanted to increase their share in exercising power at the expense of the magnates Magnates dominated the most important offices in the state secular and ecclesiastical and sat on the royal council later the senate The growing importance of the middle nobility had an impact on the establishment of the institution of the land sejmik local assembly which subsequently obtained more rights During the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth century sejmiks received more and more power and became the most important institutions of local power In 1454 Casimir IV Jagiellon granted the sejmiks the right to decide on taxes and to convene a mass mobilization in the Nieszawa Statutes He also pledged not to create new laws without their consent Modern era Early modern period In 17th century England there was renewed interest in Magna Carta The Parliament of England passed the Petition of Right in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects The English Civil War 16421651 was fought between the King and an oligarchic but elected Parliament during which the idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the Putney Debates of 1647 Subsequently the Protectorate 165359 and the English Restoration 1660 restored more autocratic rule although Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act in 1679 which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence After the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the Bill of Rights was enacted in 1689 which codified certain rights and liberties and is still in effect The Bill set out the requirement for regular elections rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch ensuring that unlike much of Europe at the time royal absolutism would not prevail Economic historians Douglass North and Barry Weingast have characterized the institutions implemented in the Glorious Revolution as a resounding success in terms of restraining the government and ensuring protection for property rights Renewed interest in the Magna Carta the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution in the 17th century prompted the growth of political philosophy on the British Isles Thomas Hobbes was the first philosopher to articulate a detailed social contract theory Writing in the Leviathan 1651 Hobbes theorized that individuals living in the state of nature led lives that were solitary poor nasty brutish and short and constantly waged a war of all against all In order to prevent the occurrence of an anarchic state of nature Hobbes reasoned that individuals ceded their rights to a strong authoritarian power In other words Hobbes advocated for an absolute monarchy which in his opinion was the best form of government Later philosopher and physician John Locke would posit a different interpretation of social contract theory Writing in his Two Treatises of Government 1689 Locke posited that all individuals possessed the inalienable rights to life liberty and estate property According to Locke individuals would voluntarily come together to form a state for the purposes of defending their rights Particularly important for Locke were property rights whose protection Locke deemed to be a governments primary purpose Furthermore Locke asserted that governments were legitimate only if they held the consent of the governed For Locke citizens had the right to revolt against a government that acted against their interest or became tyrannical Although they were not widely read during his lifetime Lockes works are considered the founding documents of liberal thought and profoundly influenced the leaders of the American Revolution and later the French Revolution His liberal democratic framework of governance remains the preeminent form of democracy in the world In the Cossack republics of Ukraine in the 16th and 17th centuries the Cossack Hetmanate and Zaporizhian Sich the holder of the highest post of Hetman was elected by the representatives from the countrys districts In North America representative government began in Jamestown Virginia with the election of the House of Burgesses forerunner of the Virginia General Assembly in 1619 English Puritans who migrated from 1620 established colonies in New England whose local governance was democratic although these local assemblies had some small amounts of devolved power the ultimate authority was held by the Crown and the English Parliament The Puritans Pilgrim Fathers Baptists and Quakers who founded these colonies applied the democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in worldly matters 18th and 19th centuries The first Parliament of Great Britain was established in 1707 after the merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland under the Acts of Union Two key documents of the UKs uncodified constitution the English Declaration of Right 1689 restated in the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Scottish Claim of Right 1689 had both cemented Parliaments position as the supreme lawmaking body and said that the election of members of Parliament ought to be free However Parliament was only elected by male property owners which amounted to 3 of the population in 1780 The first known British person of African heritage to vote in a general election Ignatius Sancho voted in 1774 and 1780 During the Age of Liberty in Sweden 17181772 civil rights were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament The taxed peasantry was represented in parliament although with little influence but commoners without taxed property had no suffrage The creation of the shortlived Corsican Republic in 1755 was an early attempt to adopt a democratic constitution all men and women above age of 25 could vote This Corsican Constitution was the first based on Enlightenment principles and included female suffrage something that was not included in most other democracies until the 20th century Colonial America had similar property qualifications as Britain and in the period before 1776 the abundance and availability of land meant that large numbers of colonists met such requirements with at least 60 per cent of adult white males able to vote The great majority of white men were farmers who met the property ownership or taxpaying requirements With few exceptions no blacks or women could vote Vermont which on declaring independence of Great Britain in 1777 adopted a constitution modelled on Pennsylvanias citizenship and democratic suffrage for males with or without property The United States Constitution of 1787 is the oldest surviving still active governmental codified constitution The Constitution provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties but did not end slavery nor extend voting rights in the United States instead leaving the issue of suffrage to the individual states Generally states limited suffrage to white male property owners and taxpayers At the time of the first Presidential election in 1789 about 6 of the population was eligible to vote The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited US citizenship to whites only The Bill of Rights in 1791 set limits on government power to protect personal freedoms but had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification In 1789 Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and although shortlived the National Convention was elected by all men in 1792 The PolishLithuanian Constitution of 3 May 1791 sought to implement a more effective constitutional monarchy introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom In force for less than 19 months it was declared null and void by the Grodno Sejm that met in 1793 Nonetheless the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the countrys sovereignty over a century later In the United States the 1828 presidential election was the first in which nonpropertyholding white males could vote in the vast majority of states Voter turnout soared during the 1830s reaching about 80 of the adult white male population in the 1840 presidential election North Carolina was the last state to abolish property qualification in 1856 resulting in a close approximation to universal white male suffrage however taxpaying requirements remained in five states in 1860 and survived in two states until the 20th century In the 1860 United States census the slave population had grown to four million and in Reconstruction after the Civil War three constitutional amendments were passed the 13th Amendment 1865 that ended slavery the 14th Amendment 1869 that gave black people citizenship and the 15th Amendment 1870 that gave black males a nominal right to vote Full enfranchisement of citizens was not secured until after the civil rights movement gained passage by the US Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 The voting franchise in the United Kingdom was expanded and made more uniform in a series of reforms that began with the Reform Act 1832 and continued into the 20th century notably with the Representation of the People Act 1918 and the Equal Franchise Act 1928 Universal male suffrage was established in France in March 1848 in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848 During that year several revolutions broke out in Europe as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government In 1876 the Ottoman Empire transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one and held two elections the next year to elect members to her newly formed parliament Provisional Electoral Regulations were issued stating that the elected members of the Provincial Administrative Councils would elect members to the first Parliament Later that year a new constitution was promulgated which provided for a bicameral Parliament with a Senate appointed by the Sultan and a popularly elected Chamber of Deputies Only men above the age of 30 who were competent in Turkish and had full civil rights were allowed to stand for election Reasons for disqualification included holding dual citizenship being employed by a foreign government being bankrupt employed as a servant or having notoriety for ill deeds Full universal suffrage was achieved in 1934 In 1893 the selfgoverning colony New Zealand became the first country in the world except for the shortlived 18thcentury Corsican Republic to establish active universal suffrage by recognizing women as having the right to vote 20th and 21st centuries 20thcentury transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive waves of democracy variously resulting from wars revolutions decolonisation and religious and economic circumstances Global waves of democratic regression reversing democratization have also occurred in the 1920s and 30s in the 1960s and 1970s and in the 2010s World War I and the dissolution of the autocratic Ottoman and AustroHungarian empires resulted in the creation of new nationstates in Europe most of them at least nominally democratic In the 1920s democratic movements flourished and womens suffrage advanced but the Great Depression brought disenchantment and most of the countries of Europe Latin America and Asia turned to strongman rule or dictatorships Fascism and dictatorships flourished in Nazi Germany Italy Spain and Portugal as well as nondemocratic governments in the Baltics the Balkans Brazil Cuba China and Japan among others World War II brought a definitive reversal of this trend in Western Europe The democratisation of the American British and French sectors of occupied Germany disputed Austria Italy and the occupied Japan served as a model for the later theory of government change However most of Eastern Europe including the Soviet sector of Germany fell into the nondemocratic Sovietdominated bloc The war was followed by decolonisation and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions India emerged as the worlds largest democracy and continues to be so Countries that were once part of the British Empire often adopted the British Westminster system In 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights mandated democracy 3 The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures By 1960 the vast majority of countrystates were nominally democracies although most of the worlds populations lived in nominal democracies that experienced sham elections and other forms of subterfuge particularly in Communist states and the former colonies A subsequent wave of democratisation brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many states dubbed third wave of democracy Portugal Spain and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the 1970s and 1980s This was followed by countries in East and South Asia by the midtolate 1980s Economic malaise in the 1980s along with resentment of Soviet oppression contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union the associated end of the Cold War and the democratisation and liberalisation of the former Eastern bloc countries The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe and they are now either part of the European Union or candidate states In 1986 after the toppling of the most prominent Asian dictatorship the only democratic state of its kind at the time emerged in the Philippines with the rise of Corazon Aquino who would later be known as the mother of Asian democracy The liberal trend spread to some states in Africa in the 1990s most prominently in South Africa Some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the Indonesian Revolution of 1998 the Bulldozer Revolution in Yugoslavia the Rose Revolution in Georgia the Orange Revolution in Ukraine the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan and the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia According to Freedom House in 2007 there were 123 electoral democracies up from 40 in 1972 According to World Forum on Democracy electoral democracies now represent 120 of the 192 existing countries and constitute 582 per cent of the worlds population At the same time liberal democracies ie countries Freedom House regards as free and respectful of basic human rights and the rule of law are 85 in number and represent 38 per cent of the global population Also in 2007 the United Nations declared 15 September the International Day of Democracy Many countries reduced their voting age to 18 years the major democracies began to do so in the 1970s starting in Western Europe and North America Most electoral democracies continue to exclude those younger than 18 from voting The voting age has been lowered to 16 for national elections in a number of countries including Brazil Austria Cuba and Nicaragua In California a 2004 proposal to permit a quarter vote at 14 and a half vote at 16 was ultimately defeated In 2008 the German parliament proposed but shelved a bill that would grant the vote to each citizen at birth to be used by a parent until the child claims it for themselves According to Freedom House starting in 2005 there have been 17 consecutive years in which declines in political rights and civil liberties throughout the world have outnumbered improvements as populist and nationalist political forces have gained ground everywhere from Poland under the Law and Justice Party to the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte In a Freedom House report released in 2018 Democracy Scores for most countries declined for the 12th consecutive year The Christian Science Monitor reported that nationalist and populist political ideologies were gaining ground at the expense of rule of law in countries like Poland Turkey and Hungary For example in Poland the President appointed 27 new Supreme Court judges over legal objections from the European Commission In Turkey thousands of judges were removed from their positions following a failed coup attempt during a government crackdown Democratic backsliding in the 2010s were attributed to economic inequality and social discontent personalism poor governments management of the COVID19 pandemic as well as other factors such as manipulation of civil society toxic polarization foreign disinformation campaigns racism and nativism excessive executive power and decreased power of the opposition Within Englishspeaking Western democracies protectionbased attitudes combining cultural conservatism and leftist economic attitudes were the strongest predictor of support for authoritarian modes of governance Theory Early theory Aristotle contrasted rule by the many democracytimocracy with rule by the few oligarchyaristocracy and with rule by a single person tyranny or today autocracyabsolute monarchy He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy A common view among early and renaissance Republican theorists was that democracy could only survive in small political communities Heeding the lessons of the Roman Republics shift to monarchism as it grew larger or smaller these Republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny Democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically as it could only survive in small political units which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units Montesquieu famously said if a republic is small it is destroyed by an outside force if it is large it is destroyed by an internal vice Rousseau asserted It is therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic of middling ones to be subject to a monarch and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince Contemporary theory Among modern political theorists there are three contending conceptions of democracy aggregative democracy deliberative democracy and radical democracy Aggregative The theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt Therefore proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting where the policy with the most votes gets implemented Different variants of aggregative democracy exist Under minimalism democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections According to this minimalist conception citizens cannot and should not rule because for example on most issues most of the time they have no clear views or their views are not wellfounded Joseph Schumpeter articulated this view most famously in his book Capitalism Socialism and Democracy Contemporary proponents of minimalism include William H Riker Adam Przeworski Richard Posner According to the theory of direct democracy on the other hand citizens should vote directly not through their representatives on legislative proposals Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view Political activity can be valuable in itself it socialises and educates citizens and popular participation can check powerful elites Most importantly citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voterwith half to their left and the other half to their right This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of selfinterested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes Anthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book An Economic Theory of Democracy Robert A Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that when it comes to binding collective decisions each person in a political community is entitled to have hisher interests be given equal consideration not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society However these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if for example poverty prevents political participation Similarly Ronald Dworkin argues that democracy is a substantive not a merely procedural ideal Deliberative Deliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation Unlike aggregative democracy deliberative democracy holds that for a democratic decision to be legitimate it must be preceded by authentic deliberation not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decisionmakers that is free from distortions of unequal political power such as power a decisionmaker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups If the decisionmakers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule Citizens assemblies are considered by many scholars as practical examples of deliberative democracy with a recent OECD report identifying citizens assemblies as an increasingly popular mechanism to involve citizens in governmental decisionmaking Radical Radical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society Democracys role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference dissent and antagonisms in decisionmaking processes Measurement of democracy Democracy indices Difficulties in measuring democracy Types of governmental democracies Democracy has taken a number of forms both in theory and practice Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others However if any democracy is not structured to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its favour then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy The following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can coexist in a single system Basic forms Several variants of democracy exist but there are two basic forms both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will One form of democracy is direct democracy in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making for example voting on policy initiatives directly In most modern democracies the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives this is called a representative democracy Direct Direct democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decisionmaking personally contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to Change constitutional laws Put forth initiatives referendums and suggestions for laws Within modernday representative governments certain electoral tools like referendums citizens initiatives and recall elections are referred to as forms of direct democracy However some advocates of direct democracy argue for local assemblies of facetoface discussion Direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities communities affiliated with the CIPORFM the Bolivian city councils of FEJUVE and Kurdish cantons of Rojava Semidirect Some modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic These democracies which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy are termed semidirect democracies or participatory democracies Examples include Switzerland and some US states where frequent use is made of referendums and initiatives The Swiss confederation is a semidirect democracy At the federal level citizens can propose changes to the constitution federal popular initiative or ask for a referendum to be held on any law voted by the parliament Between January 1995 and June 2005 Swiss citizens voted 31 times to answer 103 questions during the same period French citizens participated in only two referendums Although in the past 120 years less than 250 initiatives have been put to referendum Examples include the extensive use of referendums in the US state of California which is a state that has more than 20 million voters In New England town meetings are often used especially in rural areas to manage local government This creates a hybrid form of government with a local direct democracy and a representative state government For example most Vermont towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected budgets for the town and schools are voted on and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters Lot system The use of a lot system a characteristic of Athenian democracy is a feature of some versions of direct democracies In this system important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery Representative Representative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented If the head of state is also democratically elected then it is called a democratic republic The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a plurality of the votes Most western countries have representative systems Representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district or constituency or represent the entire electorate through proportional systems with some using a combination of the two Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy such as referendums A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the peoples interest they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy Parliamentary Parliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by or can be dismissed by representatives as opposed to a presidential rule wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters Under a parliamentary democracy government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people In a parliamentary system the prime minister may be dismissed by the legislature at any point in time for not meeting the expectations of the legislature This is done through a vote of no confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the prime minister from office with majority support for dismissal In some countries the prime minister can also call an election at any point in time typically when the prime minister believes that they are in good favour with the public as to get reelected In other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the loyal opposition The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party or opposition opposes the governing party or coalition while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles Presidential Presidential democracy is a system where the public elects the president through an election The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time The legislature often has limited ability to remove a president from office Elections typically have a fixed date and arent easily changed The president has direct control over the cabinet specifically appointing the cabinet members The executive usually has the responsibility to execute or implement legislation and may have the limited legislative powers such as a veto However a legislative branch passes legislation and budgets This provides some measure of separation of powers In consequence however the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas Africa and Central and Southeast Asia A semipresidential system is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country Typology Constitutional monarchy Many countries such as the United Kingdom Spain the Netherlands Belgium Scandinavian countries Thailand Japan and Bhutan turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs often gradually with limited or symbolic roles For example in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689 Strongly limited constitutional monarchies such as the United Kingdom have been referred to as crowned republics by writers such as H G Wells In other countries the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system as in France China Russia Germany Austria Hungary Italy Greece and Egypt An elected person with or without significant powers became the head of state in these countries Elite upper houses of legislatures which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure were common in many states Over time these either had their powers limited as with the British House of Lords or else became elective and remained powerful as with the Australian Senate Republic The term republic has many different meanings but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected head of state such as a president serving for a limited term in contrast to states with a hereditary monarch as a head of state even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed head of government such as a prime minister The Founding Fathers of the United States often criticised direct democracy which in their view often came without the protection of a constitution enshrining inalienable rights James Madison argued especially in The Federalist No 10 that what distinguished a direct democracy from a republic was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure Professors Richard Ellis of Willamette University and Michael Nelson of Rhodes College argue that much constitutional thought from Madison to Lincoln and beyond has focused on the problem of majority tyranny They conclude The principles of republican government embedded in the Constitution represent an effort by the framers to ensure that the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness would not be trampled by majorities What was critical to American values John Adams insisted was that the government be bound by fixed laws which the people have a voice in making and a right to defend As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the US Constitution Elizabeth Willing Powel asked him Well Doctor what have we gota republic or a monarchy He replied A republicif you can keep it Liberal A liberal democracy is a representative democracy which enshrines a liberal political philosophy where the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decisionmaking power is subject to the rule of law moderated by a constitution or laws that such as the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals and constrained on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities Socialist Socialist thought has several different views on democracy Social democracy democratic socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat are some examples Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of participatory industrial economic andor workplace democracy combined with a representative democracy Trotskyist groups have interpreted socialist democracy to be synonymous with multiparty socialist representation autonomous union organizations workers control of production internal party democracy and the mass participation of the working masses Marxist Within Marxist orthodoxy there is a hostility to what is commonly called liberal democracy which is referred to as parliamentary democracy because of its centralised nature Because of orthodox Marxists desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism Marxists Leninists and Trotskyists believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of communes which are sometimes called soviets This system can begin with workplace democracy and ultimately manifests itself as council democracy Anarchist Anarchists are split in this domain depending on whether they believe that a majorityrule is tyrannic or not To many anarchists the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy PierreJoseph Proudhon argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority even when unanimous However anarchocommunist Murray Bookchin criticised individualist anarchists for opposing democracy and says majority rule is consistent with anarchism Some anarchocommunists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy feeling that it can impede individual liberty and optin favour of a nonmajoritarian form of consensus democracy similar to Proudhons position on direct democracy Sortition Sortition is the process of choosing decisionmaking bodies via a random selection These bodies can be more representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large than an elected legislature or other decisionmaker The technique was in widespread use in Athenian Democracy and Renaissance Florence and is still used in modern jury selection and citizens assemblies Consociational Consociational democracy also called consociationalism is a form of democracy based on powersharing formula between elites representing the social groups within the society In 1969 Arendt Lijphart argued this would stabilize democracies with factions A consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethnoreligious constituencies and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them The Qualified majority voting rule in European Council of Ministers is a consociational democracy approach for supranational democracies This system in Treaty of Rome allocates votes to member states in part according to their population but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states A consociational democracy requires consensus of representatives while consensus democracy requires consensus of electorate Consensus Consensus democracy requires consensus decisionmaking and supermajority to obtain a larger support than majority In contrast in majoritarian democracy minority opinions can potentially be ignored by votewinning majorities Constitutions typically require consensus or supermajorities Ethnic Inclusive Inclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for direct democracy in all fields of social life political democracy in the form of facetoface assemblies which are confederated economic democracy in a stateless moneyless and marketless economy democracy in the social realm ie selfmanagement in places of work and education and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher Takis Fotopoulos in Towards An Inclusive Democracy and was further developed in the journal Democracy Nature and its successor The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy Participatory A parpolity or participatory polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a nested council structure The guiding philosophy is that people should have decisionmaking power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision Local councils of 2550 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council A council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the tyranny of the majority and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council Delegates are recallable at any time Referendums are possible at any time via votes of lowerlevel councils however not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a participatory economy Religious Cosmopolitan Cosmopolitan democracy also known as global democracy or world federalism is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale either directly or through representatives An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who by definition cannot vote By contrast in a cosmopolitan democracy the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them According to its supporters any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy including the rule of law the nonviolent resolution of conflicts and equality among citizens beyond the limits of the state To be fully implemented this would require reforming existing international organisations eg the United Nations as well as the creation of new institutions such as a World Parliament which ideally would enhance public control over and accountability in international politics Cosmopolitan democracy has been promoted among others by physicist Albert Einstein writer Kurt Vonnegut columnist George Monbiot and professors David Held and Daniele Archibugi The creation of the International Criminal Court in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy Creative Creative democracy is advocated by American philosopher John Dewey The main idea about creative democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of Creative Democracy The Task Before Us and an experience built on faith in human nature faith in human beings and faith in working with others Democracy in Deweys view is a moral ideal requiring actual effort and work by people it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves The task of democracy Dewey concludes is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute Guided Guided democracy is a form of democracy that incorporates regular popular elections but which often carefully guides the choices offered to the electorate in a manner that may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority Russianstyle democracy has often been referred to as a guided democracy Russian politicians have referred to their government as having only one center of power authority as opposed to most other forms of democracy which usually attempt to incorporate two or more naturally competing sources of authority within the same government Nongovernmental democracy Aside from the public sphere similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups Many nongovernmental organisations decide policy and leadership by voting Most trade unions and cooperatives are governed by democratic elections Corporations are ultimately governed by their shareholders through shareholder democracy Corporations may also employ systems such as workplace democracy to handle internal governance Amitai Etzioni has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with sharia law termed Islamocracy There is also a growing number of Democratic educational institutions such as Sudbury schools that are cogoverned by students and staff Shareholder democracy Shareholder democracy is a concept relating to the governance of corporations by their shareholders In the United States shareholders are typically granted voting rights according to the one share one vote principle Shareholders may vote annually to elect the companys board of directors who themselves may choose the companys executives The shareholder democracy framework may be inaccurate for companies which have different classes of stock that further alter the distribution of voting rights Justification Several justifications for democracy have been postulated Legitimacy Social contract theory argues that the legitimacy of government is based on consent of the governed ie an election and that political decisions must reflect the general will Some proponents of the theory like JeanJacques Rousseau advocate for a direct democracy on this basis Better decisionmaking Condorcets jury theorem is logical proof that if each decisionmaker has a better than chance probability of making the right decision then having the largest number of decisionmakers ie a democracy will result in the best decisions This has also been argued by theories of the wisdom of the crowd Democracy tends to improve conflict resolution Economic success In Why Nations Fail economists Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson argue that democracies are more economically successful because undemocratic political systems tend to limit markets and favor monopolies at the expense of the creative destruction which is necessary for sustained economic growth A 2019 study by Acemoglu and others estimated that countries switching to democratic from authoritarian rule had on average a 20 higher GDP after 25 years than if they had remained authoritarian The study examined 122 transitions to democracy and 71 transitions to authoritarian rule occurring from 1960 to 2010 Acemoglu said this was because democracies tended to invest more in health care and human capital and reduce special treatment of regime allies A 2023 study analyzed the longterm effects of democracy on economic prosperity using new data on GDP per capita and democracy for a dataset between 1789 and 2019 The results indicate that democracy substantially increases economic development Democracy promotion Democracy promotion can increase the quality of already existing democracies reduce political apathy and the chance of democratic backsliding Democracy promotion measures include voting advice applications participatory democracy increasing youth suffrage increasing civic education reducing barriers to entry for new political parties increasing proportionality and reducing presidentialism Democratic transitions A democratic transition describes a phase in a countrys political system often created as a result of an incomplete change from an authoritarian regime to a democratic one or vice versa Democratization Several philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy Other commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development In a related theory Ronald Inglehart suggests that improved livingstandards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted leading to increased emphasis on selfexpression values which correlates closely with democracy Douglas M Gibler and Andrew Owsiak in their study argued about the importance of peace and stable borders for the development of democracy It has often been assumed that democracy causes peace but this study shows that historically peace has almost always predated the establishment of democracy Carroll Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy Democracythis scenariotends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use By the 1800s guns were the best personal weapons available and in the United States of America already nominally democratic almost everyone could afford to buy a gun and could learn how to use it fairly easily Governments could not do any better it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns Similarly Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and democracy Other theories stressed the relevance of education and of human capitaland within them of cognitive ability to increasing tolerance rationality political literacy and participation Two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished a cognitive effect competence to make rational choices better informationprocessing an ethical effect support of democratic values freedom human rights etc which itself depends on intelligence Evidence consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by Statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier more educated or less unequal In fact empirical evidence shows that economic growth and education may not lead to increased demand for democratization as modernization theory suggests historically most countries attained high levels of access to primary education well before transitioning to democracy Rather than acting as a catalyst for democratization in some situations education provision may instead be used by nondemocratic regimes to indoctrinate their subjects and strengthen their power The assumed link between education and economic growth is called into question when analyzing empirical evidence Across different countries the correlation between education attainment and math test scores is very weak 07 A similarly weak relationship exists between perpupil expenditures and math competency 26 Additionally historical evidence suggests that average human capital measured using literacy rates of the masses does not explain the onset of industrialization in France from 1750 to 1850 despite arguments to the contrary Together these findings show that education does not always promote human capital and economic growth as is generally argued to be the case Instead the evidence implies that education provision often falls short of its expressed goals or alternatively that political actors use education to promote goals other than economic growth and development Some scholars have searched for the deep determinants of contemporary political institutions be they geographical or demographic An example of this is the disease environment Places with different mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world For example in Africa the tsetse flywhich afflicts humans and livestockreduced the ability of Africans to plough the land This made Africa less settled As a consequence political power was less concentrated This also affected the colonial institutions European countries established in Africa Whether colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths This also affected the distribution of power and the collective actions people could take As a result some African countries ended up having democracies and others autocracies An example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of trade Trade brought economic development which in turn broadened power Rulers wanting to increase revenues had to protect propertyrights to create incentives for people to invest As more people had more power more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many places this process lead to democracy These determinants defined the structure of the society moving the balance of political power Robert Michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy The peasant in the fable when on his deathbed tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field After the old mans death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure They do not find it But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative wellbeing The treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy Democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government and many times it has faced opposition from social elites The implementation of a democratic government from a nondemocratic state is typically brought by peaceful or violent democratic revolution Autocratization Disruption Some democratic governments have experienced sudden state collapse and regime change to an undemocratic form of government Domestic military coups or rebellions are the most common means by which democratic governments have been overthrown See List of coups and coup attempts by country and List of civil wars Examples include the Spanish Civil War the Coup of 18 Brumaire that ended the French First Republic and the 28 May 1926 coup dtat which ended the First Portuguese Republic Some military coups are supported by foreign governments such as the 1954 Guatemalan coup dtat and the 1953 Iranian coup dtat Other types of a sudden end to democracy include Invasion for example the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the fall of South Vietnam Selfcoup in which the leader of the government extralegally seizes all power or unlawfully extends the term in office This can be done through Suspension of the constitution by decree such as with the 1992 Peruvian coup dtat An electoral selfcoup using election fraud to obtain reelection of a previously fairly elected official or political party For example in the 1999 Ukrainian presidential election 2003 Russian legislative election and 2004 Russian presidential election Royal coup in which a monarch not normally involved in government seizes all power For example the 6 January Dictatorship begun in 1929 when King Alexander I of Yugoslavia dismissed parliament and started ruling by decree Democratic backsliding can end democracy in a gradual manner by increasing emphasis on national security and eroding free and fair elections freedom of expression independence of the judiciary rule of law A famous example is the Enabling Act of 1933 which lawfully ended democracy in Weimar Germany and marked the transition to Nazi Germany Temporary or longterm political violence and government interference can prevent free and fair elections which erode the democratic nature of governments This has happened on a local level even in wellestablished democracies like the United States for example the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 and AfricanAmerican disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era Debates on democracy Importance of mass media The theory of democracy relies on the implicit assumption that voters are well informed about social issues policies and candidates so that they can make a truly informed decision Since the late 20th century there has been a growing concern that voters may be poorly informed due to the news medias focusing more on entertainment and gossip and less on serious journalistic research on political issues The media professors Michael Gurevitch and Jay Blumler have proposed a number of functions that the mass media are expected to fulfill in a democracy Surveillance of the sociopolitical environment Meaningful agenda setting Platforms for an intelligible and illuminating advocacy Dialogue across a diverse range of views Mechanisms for holding officials to account for how they have exercised power Incentives for citizens to learn choose and become involved A principled resistance to the efforts of forces outside the media to subvert their independence integrity and ability to serve the audience A sense of respect for the audience member as potentially concerned and able to make sense of his or her political environment This proposal has inspired a lot of discussions over whether the news media are actually fulfilling the requirements that a well functioning democracy requires Commercial mass media are generally not accountable to anybody but their owners and they have no obligation to serve a democratic function They are controlled mainly by economic market forces Fierce economic competition may force the mass media to divert themselves from any democratic ideals and focus entirely on how to survive the competition The tabloidization and popularization of the news media is seen in an increasing focus on human examples rather than statistics and principles There is more focus on politicians as personalities and less focus on political issues in the popular media Election campaigns are covered more as horse races and less as debates about ideologies and issues The dominating media focus on spin conflict and competitive strategies has made voters perceive the politicians as egoists rather than idealists This fosters mistrust and a cynical attitude to politics less civic engagement and less interest in voting The ability to find effective political solutions to social problems is hampered when problems tend to be blamed on individuals rather than on structural causes This personcentered focus may have farreaching consequences not only for domestic problems but also for foreign policy when international conflicts are blamed on foreign heads of state rather than on political and economic structures A strong media focus on fear and terrorism has allowed military logic to penetrate public institutions leading to increased surveillance and the erosion of civil rights The responsiveness and accountability of the democratic system is compromised when lack of access to substantive diverse and undistorted information is handicapping the citizens capability of evaluating the political process The fast pace and trivialization in the competitive news media is dumbing down the political debate Thorough and balanced investigation of complex political issues does not fit into this format The political communication is characterized by short time horizons short slogans simple explanations and simple solutions This is conducive to political populism rather than serious deliberation Commercial mass media are often differentiated along the political spectrum so that people can hear mainly opinions that they already agree with Too much controversy and diverse opinions are not always profitable for the commercial news media Political polarization is emerging when different people read different news and watch different TV channels This polarization has been worsened by the emergence of the social media that allow people to communicate mainly with groups of likeminded people the socalled echo chambers Extreme political polarization may undermine the trust in democratic institutions leading to erosion of civil rights and free speech and in some cases even reversion to autocracy Many media scholars have discussed noncommercial news media with public service obligations as a means to improve the democratic process by providing the kind of political contents that a free market does not provide The World Bank has recommended public service broadcasting in order to strengthen democracy in developing countries These broadcasting services should be accountable to an independent regulatory body that is adequately protected from interference from political and economic interests Public service media have an obligation to provide reliable information to voters Many countries have publicly funded radio and television stations with public service obligations especially in Europe and Japan while such media are weak or nonexistent in other countries including the US Several studies have shown that the stronger the dominance of commercial broadcast media over public service media the less the amount of policyrelevant information in the media and the more focus on horse race journalism personalities and the pecadillos of politicians Public service broadcasters are characterized by more policyrelevant information and more respect for journalistic norms and impartiality than the commercial media However the trend of deregulation has put the public service model under increased pressure from competition with commercial media The emergence of the internet and the social media has profoundly altered the conditions for political communication The social media have given ordinary citizens easy access to voice their opinion and share information while bypassing the filters of the large news media This is often seen as an advantage for democracy The new possibilities for communication have fundamentally changed the way social movements and protest movements operate and organize The internet and social media have provided powerful new tools for democracy movements in developing countries and emerging democracies enabling them to bypass censorship voice their opinions and organize protests A serious problem with the social media is that they have no truth filters The established news media have to guard their reputation as trustworthy while ordinary citizens may post unreliable information In fact studies show that false stories are going more viral than true stories The proliferation of false stories and conspiracy theories may undermine public trust in the political system and public officials Reliable information sources are essential for the democratic process Less democratic governments rely heavily on censorship propaganda and misinformation in order to stay in power while independent sources of information are able to undermine their legitimacy See also Footnotes References Works cited Further reading Cartledge Paul 2016 Democracy A Life Oxford University Press ISBN 9780199697670 Provost Claire Kennard Matt 2023

    title: "Socialism",
    originalContent:
      "Socialism is an economic and political philosophy encompassing diverse economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production as opposed to private ownership It describes the economic political and social theories and movements associated with the implementation of such systems Social ownership can take various forms including public community collective cooperative or employee As one of the main ideologies on the political spectrum socialism is considered as the standard leftwing ideology in most countries Types of socialism vary based on the role of markets and planning in resource allocation and the structure of management in organizations Socialist systems divide into nonmarket and market forms A nonmarket socialist system seeks to eliminate the perceived inefficiencies irrationalities unpredictability and crises that socialists traditionally associate with capital accumulation and the profit system Market socialism retains the use of monetary prices factor markets and sometimes the profit motive As a political force socialist parties and ideas exercise varying degrees of power and influence heading national governments in several countries Socialist politics have been internationalist and nationalist organised through political parties and opposed to party politics at times overlapping with trade unions and other times independent and critical of them and present in industrialised and developing nations Social democracy originated within the socialist movement supporting economic and social interventions to promote social justice While retaining socialism as a longterm goal in the postwar period social democracy embraced a mixed economy based on Keynesianism within a predominantly developed capitalist market economy and liberal democratic polity that expands state intervention to include income redistribution regulation and a welfare state The socialist political movement includes political philosophies that originated in the revolutionary movements of the midtolate 18th century and out of concern for the social problems that socialists associated with capitalism By the late 19th century after the work of Karl Marx and his collaborator Friedrich Engels socialism had come to signify anticapitalism and advocacy for a postcapitalist system based on some form of social ownership of the means of production By the early 1920s communism and social democracy had become the two dominant political tendencies within the international socialist movement with socialism itself becoming the most influential secular movement of the 20th century Many socialists also adopted the causes of other social movements such as feminism environmentalism and progressivism While the emergence of the Soviet Union as the worlds first nominally socialist state led to socialisms widespread association with the Soviet economic model academics have noted that some Western European countries have been governed by socialist parties or have mixed economies that are sometimes called democratic socialist Following the revolutions of 1989 many of these countries moved away from socialism as a neoliberal consensus replaced the social democratic consensus in the advanced capitalist world while many former socialist politicians and political parties embraced Third Way politics remaining committed to equality and welfare while abandoning public ownership and classbased politics Socialism experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 2010s most prominently in the form of democratic socialism Etymology According to Andrew Vincent the word socialism finds its root in the Latin sociare which means to combine or to share The related more technical term in Roman and then medieval law was societas This latter word could mean companionship and fellowship as well as the more legalistic idea of a consensual contract between freemen Initial use of socialism was claimed by Pierre Leroux who alleged he first used the term in the Parisian journal Le Globe in 1832 Leroux was a follower of Henri de SaintSimon one of the founders of what would later be labelled utopian socialism Socialism contrasted with the liberal doctrine of individualism that emphasized the moral worth of the individual while stressing that people act or should act as if they are in isolation from one another The original utopian socialists condemned this doctrine of individualism for failing to address social concerns during the Industrial Revolution including poverty oppression and vast wealth inequality They viewed their society as harming community life by basing society on competition They presented socialism as an alternative to liberal individualism based on the shared ownership of resources SaintSimon proposed economic planning scientific administration and the application of scientific understanding to the organisation of society By contrast Robert Owen proposed to organise production and ownership via cooperatives Socialism is also attributed in France to Marie Roch Louis Reybaud while in Britain it is attributed to Owen who became one of the fathers of the cooperative movement The definition and usage of socialism settled by the 1860s with the term socialist replacing associationist cooperative mutualist and collectivist which had been used as synonyms while the term communism fell out of use during this period An early distinction between communism and socialism was that the latter aimed to only socialise production while the former aimed to socialise both production and consumption in the form of free access to final goods By 1888 Marxists employed socialism in place of communism as the latter had come to be considered an oldfashioned synonym for socialism It was not until after the Bolshevik Revolution that socialism was appropriated by Vladimir Lenin to mean a stage between capitalism and communism He used it to defend the Bolshevik program from Marxist criticism that Russias productive forces were not sufficiently developed for communism The distinction between communism and socialism became salient in 1918 after the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party renamed itself to the AllRussian Communist Party interpreting communism specifically to mean socialists who supported the politics and theories of Bolshevism Leninism and later that of MarxismLeninism although communist parties continued to describe themselves as socialists dedicated to socialism According to The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx Marx used many terms to refer to a postcapitalist societypositive humanism socialism communism realm of free individuality free association of producers etc He used these terms completely interchangeably The notion that socialism and communism are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death In Christian Europe communists were believed to have adopted atheism In Protestant England communism was too close to the Roman Catholic communion rite hence socialist was the preferred term Engels wrote that in 1848 when The Communist Manifesto was published socialism was respectable in Europe while communism was not The Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France were considered respectable socialists while workingclass movements that proclaimed the necessity of total social change denoted themselves communists This branch of socialism produced the communist work of tienne Cabet in France and Wilhelm Weitling in Germany British moral philosopher John Stuart Mill discussed a form of economic socialism within free market In later editions of his Principles of Political Economy 1848 Mill posited that as far as economic theory was concerned there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies and promoted substituting capitalist businesses with worker cooperatives While democrats looked to the Revolutions of 1848 as a democratic revolution which in the long run ensured liberty equality and fraternity Marxists denounced it as a betrayal of workingclass ideals by a bourgeoisie indifferent to the proletariat History The history of socialism has its origins in the Age of Enlightenment and the 1789 French Revolution along with the changes that brought although it has precedents in earlier movements and ideas The Communist Manifesto was written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 184748 just before the Revolutions of 1848 swept Europe expressing what they termed scientific socialism In the last third of the 19th century parties dedicated to Democratic socialism arose in Europe drawing mainly from Marxism The Australian Labor Party was the first elected socialist party when it formed government in the Colony of Queensland for a week in 1899 In the first half of the 20th century the Soviet Union and the communist parties of the Third International around the world came to represent socialism in terms of the Soviet model of economic development and the creation of centrally planned economies directed by a state that owns all the means of production although other trends condemned what they saw as the lack of democracy The establishment of the Peoples Republic of China in 1949 saw socialism introduced China experienced land redistribution and the AntiRightist Movement followed by the disastrous Great Leap Forward In the UK Herbert Morrison said that socialism is what the Labour government does whereas Aneurin Bevan argued socialism requires that the main streams of economic activity are brought under public direction with an economic plan and workers democracy Some argued that capitalism had been abolished Socialist governments established the mixed economy with partial nationalisations and social welfare By 1968 the prolonged Vietnam War gave rise to the New Left socialists who tended to be critical of the Soviet Union and social democracy Anarchosyndicalists and some elements of the New Left and others favoured decentralised collective ownership in the form of cooperatives or workers councils In 1989 the Soviet Union saw the end of communism marked by the Revolutions of 1989 across Eastern Europe culminating in the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 Socialists have adopted the causes of other social movements such as environmentalism feminism and progressivism Early 21st century In 1990 the So Paulo Forum was launched by the Workers Party Brazil linking leftwing socialist parties in Latin America Its members were associated with the Pink tide of leftwing governments on the continent in the early 21st century Member parties ruling countries included the Front for Victory in Argentina the PAIS Alliance in Ecuador Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front in El Salvador Peru Wins in Peru and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela whose leader Hugo Chvez initiated what he called Socialism of the 21st century Many mainstream democratic socialist and social democratic parties continued to drift rightwards On the right of the socialist movement the Progressive Alliance was founded in 2013 by current or former members of the Socialist International The organisation states the aim of becoming the global network of the progressive democratic socialdemocratic socialist and labour movement Mainstream social democratic and socialist parties are also networked in Europe in the Party of European Socialists formed in 1992 Many of these parties lost large parts of their electoral base in the early 21st century This phenomenon is known as Pasokification from the Greek party PASOK which saw a declining share of the vote in national electionsfrom 439 in 2009 to 132 in May 2012 to 123 in June 2012 and 47 in 2015due to its poor handling of the Greek governmentdebt crisis and implementation of harsh austerity measures In Europe the share of votes for such socialist parties was at its 70year lowest in 2015 For example the Socialist Party after winning the 2012 French presidential election rapidly lost its vote share the Social Democratic Party of Germanys fortunes declined rapidly from 2005 to 2019 and outside Europe the Israeli Labor Party fell from being the dominant force in Israeli politics to 443 of the vote in the April 2019 Israeli legislative election and the Peruvian Aprista Party went from ruling party in 2011 to a minor party The decline of these mainstream parties opened space for more radical and populist left parties in some countries such as Spains Podemos Greeces Syriza in government 201519 Germanys Die Linke and Frances La France Insoumise In other countries leftwing revivals have taken place within mainstream democratic socialist and centrist parties as with Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom and Bernie Sanders in the United States Few of these radical left parties have won national government in Europe while some more mainstream socialist parties have managed to such as Portugals Socialist Party Bhaskar Sunkara the founding editor of the American socialist magazine Jacobin argued that the appeal of socialism persists due to the inequality and tremendous suffering under current global capitalism the use of wage labor which rests on the exploitation and domination of humans by other humans and ecological crises such as climate change In contrast Mark J Perry of the conservative American Enterprise Institute AEI argued that despite socialisms resurgence it is still a flawed system based on completely faulty principles that arent consistent with human behavior and cant nurture the human spirit adding that While it promised prosperity equality and security it delivered poverty misery and tyranny Some in the scientific community have suggested that a contemporary radical response to social and ecological problems could be seen in the emergence of movements associated with degrowth ecosocialism and ecoanarchism Social and political theory Early socialist thought took influences from a diverse range of philosophies such as civic republicanism Enlightenment rationalism romanticism forms of materialism Christianity both Catholic and Protestant natural law and natural rights theory utilitarianism and liberal political economy Another philosophical basis for a great deal of early socialism was the emergence of positivism during the European Enlightenment Positivism held that both the natural and social worlds could be understood through scientific knowledge and be analysed using scientific methods The fundamental objective of socialism is to attain an advanced level of material production and therefore greater productivity efficiency and rationality as compared to capitalism and all previous systems under the view that an expansion of human productive capability is the basis for the extension of freedom and equality in society Many forms of socialist theory hold that human behaviour is largely shaped by the social environment In particular socialism holds that social mores values cultural traits and economic practices are social creations and not the result of an immutable natural law The object of their critique is thus not human avarice or human consciousness but the material conditions and manmade social systems ie the economic structure of society which give rise to observed social problems and inefficiencies Bertrand Russell often considered to be the father of analytic philosophy identified as a socialist Russell opposed the class struggle aspects of Marxism viewing socialism solely as an adjustment of economic relations to accommodate modern machine production to benefit all of humanity through the progressive reduction of necessary work time Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature and define freedom as a state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions The socialist concept of individuality is intertwined with the concept of individual creative expression Karl Marx believed that expansion of the productive forces and technology was the basis for the expansion of human freedom and that socialism being a system that is consistent with modern developments in technology would enable the flourishing of free individualities through the progressive reduction of necessary labour time The reduction of necessary labour time to a minimum would grant individuals the opportunity to pursue the development of their true individuality and creativity Criticism of capitalism Socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalities that require costly corrective regulatory measures They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products such as highpressure advertisement to be sold at a profit thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates rather than for consumption even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need and therefore a crucial criticism often made by socialists is that making money or accumulation of capital does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand the production of usevalues The fundamental criterion for economic activity in capitalism is the accumulation of capital for reinvestment in production but this spurs the development of new nonproductive industries that do not produce usevalue and only exist to keep the accumulation process afloat otherwise the system goes into crisis such as the spread of the financial industry contributing to the formation of economic bubbles Such accumulation and reinvestment when it demands a constant rate of profit causes problems if the earnings in the rest of society do not increase in proportion Socialists view private property relations as limiting the potential of productive forces in the economy According to socialists private property becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralised socialised institutions based on private appropriation of revenuebut based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputsuntil the role of the capitalist becomes redundant With no need for capital accumulation and a class of owners private property in the means of production is perceived as being an outdated form of economic organisation that should be replaced by a free association of individuals based on public or common ownership of these socialised assets Private ownership imposes constraints on planning leading to uncoordinated economic decisions that result in business fluctuations unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis of overproduction Excessive disparities in income distribution lead to social instability and require costly corrective measures in the form of redistributive taxation which incurs heavy administrative costs while weakening the incentive to work inviting dishonesty and increasing the likelihood of tax evasion while the corrective measures reduce the overall efficiency of the market economy These corrective policies limit the incentive system of the market by providing things such as minimum wages unemployment insurance taxing profits and reducing the reserve army of labour resulting in reduced incentives for capitalists to invest in more production In essence social welfare policies cripple capitalism and its incentive system and are thus unsustainable in the long run Marxists argue that the establishment of a socialist mode of production is the only way to overcome these deficiencies Socialists and specifically Marxian socialists argue that the inherent conflict of interests between the working class and capital prevent optimal use of available human resources and leads to contradictory interest groups labour and business striving to influence the state to intervene in the economy in their favour at the expense of overall economic efficiency Early socialists utopian socialists and Ricardian socialists criticised capitalism for concentrating power and wealth within a small segment of society In addition they complained that capitalism does not use available technology and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public Marxism Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels argued that socialism would emerge from historical necessity as capitalism rendered itself obsolete and unsustainable from increasing internal contradictions emerging from the development of the productive forces and technology It was these advances in the productive forces combined with the old social relations of production of capitalism that would generate contradictions leading to workingclass consciousness Marx and Engels held the view that the consciousness of those who earn a wage or salary the working class in the broadest Marxist sense would be moulded by their conditions of wage slavery leading to a tendency to seek their freedom or emancipation by overthrowing ownership of the means of production by capitalists and consequently overthrowing the state that upheld this economic order For Marx and Engels conditions determine consciousness and ending the role of the capitalist class leads eventually to a classless society in which the state would wither away Marx and Engels used the terms socialism and communism interchangeably but many later Marxists defined socialism as a specific historical phase that would displace capitalism and precede communism The major characteristics of socialism particularly as conceived by Marx and Engels after the Paris Commune of 1871 are that the proletariat would control the means of production through a workers state erected by the workers in their interests For orthodox Marxists socialism is the lower stage of communism based on the principle of from each according to his ability to each according to his contribution while upper stage communism is based on the principle of from each according to his ability to each according to his need the upper stage becoming possible only after the socialist stage further develops economic efficiency and the automation of production has led to a superabundance of goods and services Marx argued that the material productive forces in industry and commerce brought into existence by capitalism predicated a cooperative society since production had become a mass social collective activity of the working class to create commodities but with private ownership the relations of production or property relations This conflict between collective effort in large factories and private ownership would bring about a conscious desire in the working class to establish collective ownership commensurate with the collective efforts their daily experience Role of the state Socialists have taken different perspectives on the state and the role it should play in revolutionary struggles in constructing socialism and within an established socialist economy In the 19th century the philosophy of state socialism was first explicitly expounded by the German political philosopher Ferdinand Lassalle In contrast to Karl Marxs perspective of the state Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a classbased power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state was destined to wither away Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for achieving socialism Preceding the Bolshevikled revolution in Russia many socialists including reformists orthodox Marxist currents such as council communism anarchists and libertarian socialists criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism Following the victory of Leninism in Russia the idea of state socialism spread rapidly throughout the socialist movement and eventually state socialism came to be identified with the Soviet economic model Joseph Schumpeter rejected the association of socialism and social ownership with state ownership over the means of production because the state as it exists in its current form is a product of capitalist society and cannot be transplanted to a different institutional framework Schumpeter argued that there would be different institutions within socialism than those that exist within modern capitalism just as feudalism had its own distinct and unique institutional forms The state along with concepts like property and taxation were concepts exclusive to commercial society capitalism and attempting to place them within the context of a future socialist society would amount to a distortion of these concepts by using them out of context Utopian versus scientific Utopian socialism is a term used to define the first currents of modern socialist thought as exemplified by the work of Henri de SaintSimon Charles Fourier and Robert Owen which inspired Karl Marx and other early socialists Visions of imaginary ideal societies which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as reactionary Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label utopian by later socialists as a negative term to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic Religious sects whose members live communally such as the Hutterites are not usually called utopian socialists although their way of living is a prime example They have been categorised as religious socialists by some Similarly modern intentional communities based on socialist ideas could also be categorised as utopian socialist For Marxists the development of capitalism in Western Europe provided a material basis for the possibility of bringing about socialism because according to The Communist Manifesto what the bourgeoisie produces above all is its own grave diggers namely the working class which must become conscious of the historical objectives set it by society Reform versus revolution Revolutionary socialists believe that a social revolution is necessary to effect structural changes to the socioeconomic structure of society Among revolutionary socialists there are differences in strategy theory and the definition of revolution Orthodox Marxists and left communists take an impossibilist stance believing that revolution should be spontaneous as a result of contradictions in society due to technological changes in the productive forces Lenin theorised that under capitalism the workers cannot achieve class consciousness beyond organising into trade unions and making demands of the capitalists Therefore Leninists argue that it is historically necessary for a vanguard of class conscious revolutionaries to take a central role in coordinating the social revolution to overthrow the capitalist state and eventually the institution of the state altogether Revolution is not necessarily defined by revolutionary socialists as violent insurrection but as a complete dismantling and rapid transformation of all areas of class society led by the majority of the masses the working class Reformism is generally associated with social democracy and gradualist democratic socialism Reformism is the belief that socialists should stand in parliamentary elections within capitalist society and if elected use the machinery of government to pass political and social reforms for the purposes of ameliorating the instabilities and inequities of capitalism Within socialism reformism is used in two different ways One has no intention of bringing about socialism or fundamental economic change to society and is used to oppose such structural changes The other is based on the assumption that while reforms are not socialist in themselves they can help rally supporters to the cause of revolution by popularizing the cause of socialism to the working class The debate on the ability for social democratic reformism to lead to a socialist transformation of society is over a century old Reformism is criticized for being paradoxical as it seeks to overcome the existing economic system of capitalism while trying to improve the conditions of capitalism thereby making it appear more tolerable to society According to Rosa Luxemburg capitalism is not overthrown but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms In a similar vein Stan Parker of the Socialist Party of Great Britain argues that reforms are a diversion of energy for socialists and are limited because they must adhere to the logic of capitalism French social theorist Andr Gorz criticized reformism by advocating a third alternative to reformism and social revolution that he called nonreformist reforms specifically focused on structural changes to capitalism as opposed to reforms to improve living conditions within capitalism or to prop it up through economic interventions Culture In the Leninist conception the role of the vanguard party was to politically educate the workers and peasants to dispel the societal false consciousness of institutional religion and nationalism that constitute the cultural status quo taught by the bourgeoisie to the proletariat to facilitate their economic exploitation of peasants and workers Influenced by Lenin the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party stated that the development of the socialist workers culture should not be hamstrung from above and opposed the Proletkult 19171925 organisational control of the national culture Similarly Trotsky viewed the party as transmitters of culture to the masses for raising the standards of education as well as entry into the cultural sphere but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner According to political scientist Baruch KneiPaz in his book The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky this represented one of several distinctions between Trotskys approach on cultural matters and Stalins policy in the 1930s In Literature and Revolution Trotsky examined aesthetic issues in relation to class and the Russian revolution Soviet scholar Robert Bird considered his work as the first systematic treatment of art by a Communist leader and a catalyst for later Marxist cultural and critical theories He would later coauthor the 1938 Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art with the endorsement of prominent artists Andre Breton and Diego Rivera Trotskys writings on literature such as his 1923 survey which advocated tolerance limited censorship and respect for literary tradition had strong appeal to the New York Intellectuals Prior to Stalins rule literary religious and national representatives had some level of autonomy in Soviet Russia throughout the 1920s but these groups were later rigorously repressed during the Stalinist era Socialist realism was imposed under Stalin in artistic production and other creative industries such as music film along with sports were subject to extreme levels of political control The countercultural phenomenon which emerged in the 1960s shaped the intellectual and radical outlook of the New Left this movement placed a heavy emphasis on antiracism antiimperialism and direct democracy in opposition to the dominant culture of advanced industrial capitalism Socialist groups have also been closely involved with a number of countercultural movements such as Vietnam Solidarity Campaign Stop the War Coalition Love Music Hate Racism AntiNazi League and Unite Against Fascism Economics Socialist economics starts from the premise that individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another Furthermore everything that people produce is in some sense a social product and everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it Society as whole therefore should own or at least control property for the benefit of all its members The original conception of socialism was an economic system whereby production was organised in a way to directly produce goods and services for their utility or usevalue in classical and Marxian economics with the direct allocation of resources in terms of physical units as opposed to financial calculation and the economic laws of capitalism see law of value often entailing the end of capitalistic economic categories such as rent interest profit and money In a fully developed socialist economy production and balancing factor inputs with outputs becomes a technical process to be undertaken by engineers Market socialism refers to an array of different economic theories and systems that use the market mechanism to organise production and to allocate factor inputs among socially owned enterprises with the economic surplus profits accruing to society in a social dividend as opposed to private capital owners Variations of market socialism include libertarian proposals such as mutualism based on classical economics and neoclassical economic models such as the Lange model Some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz Mancur Olson and others not specifically advancing antisocialists positions have shown that prevailing economic models upon which such democratic or market socialism models might be based have logical flaws or unworkable presuppositions These criticisms have been incorporated into the models of market socialism developed by John Roemer and Nicholas Vrousalis The ownership of the means of production can be based on direct ownership by the users of the productive property through worker cooperative or commonly owned by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operateuse the means of production or public ownership by a state apparatus Public ownership may refer to the creation of stateowned enterprises nationalisation municipalisation or autonomous collective institutions Some socialists feel that in a socialist economy at least the commanding heights of the economy must be publicly owned Economic liberals and right libertarians view private ownership of the means of production and the market exchange as natural entities or moral rights which are central to their conceptions of freedom and liberty and view the economic dynamics of capitalism as immutable and absolute therefore they perceive public ownership of the means of production cooperatives and economic planning as infringements upon liberty Management and control over the activities of enterprises are based on selfmanagement and selfgovernance with equal powerrelations in the workplace to maximise occupational autonomy A socialist form of organisation would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains Every member would have decisionmaking power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives The policiesgoals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals The role and use of money in a hypothetical socialist economy is a contested issue Nineteenth century socialists including Karl Marx Robert Owen PierreJoseph Proudhon and John Stuart Mill advocated various forms of labour vouchers or labour credits which like money would be used to acquire articles of consumption but unlike money they are unable to become capital and would not be used to allocate resources within the production process Bolshevik revolutionary Leon Trotsky argued that money could not be arbitrarily abolished following a socialist revolution Money had to exhaust its historic mission meaning it would have to be used until its function became redundant eventually being transformed into bookkeeping receipts for statisticians and only in the more distant future would money not be required for even that role Planned economy A planned economy is a type of economy consisting of a mixture of public ownership of the means of production and the coordination of production and distribution through economic planning A planned economy can be either decentralised or centralised Enrico Barone provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy In his model assuming perfect computation techniques simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations to balance supply and demand The most prominent example of a planned economy was the economic system of the Soviet Union and as such the centralisedplanned economic model is usually associated with the communist states of the 20th century where it was combined with a singleparty political system In a centrally planned economy decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency see also the analysis of Soviettype economic planning The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc are further classified as command economies which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands directives and production targets Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy Instead of conscious planning the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled Planning agencies ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an administered or managed economy Although central planning was largely supported by MarxistLeninists some factions within the Soviet Union before the rise of Stalinism held positions contrary to central planning Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favour of decentralised planning He argued that central planners regardless of their intellectual capacity would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people in the economy As a result central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions State socialism is unfeasible in this view because information cannot be aggregated by a central body and effectively used to formulate a plan for an entire economy because doing so would result in distorted or absent price signals Selfmanaged economy A selfmanaged decentralised economy is based on autonomous selfregulating economic units and a decentralised mechanism of resource allocation and decisionmaking This model has found support in notable classical and neoclassical economists including Alfred Marshall John Stuart Mill and Jaroslav Vanek There are numerous variations of selfmanagement including labourmanaged firms and workermanaged firms The goals of selfmanagement are to eliminate exploitation and reduce alienation Guild socialism is a political movement advocating workers control of industry through the medium of traderelated guilds in an implied contractual relationship with the public It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century It was strongly associated with G D H Cole and influenced by the ideas of William Morris One such system is the cooperative economy a largely free market economy in which workers manage the firms and democratically determine remuneration levels and labour divisions Productive resources would be legally owned by the cooperative and rented to the workers who would enjoy usufruct rights Another form of decentralised planning is the use of cybernetics or the use of computers to manage the allocation of economic inputs The socialistrun government of Salvador Allende in Chile experimented with Project Cybersyn a realtime information bridge between the government state enterprises and consumers This had been preceded by similar efforts to introduce a form of cybernetic economic planning as seen with the proposed OGAS system in the Soviet Union The OGAS project was conceived to oversee a nationwide information network but was never implemented due to conflicting bureaucratic interests Another more recent variant is participatory economics wherein the economy is planned by decentralised councils of workers and consumers Workers would be remunerated solely according to effort and sacrifice so that those engaged in dangerous uncomfortable and strenuous work would receive the highest incomes and could thereby work less A contemporary model for a selfmanaged nonmarket socialism is Pat Devines model of negotiated coordination Negotiated coordination is based upon social ownership by those affected by the use of the assets involved with decisions made by those at the most localised level of production Michel Bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peertopeer production as a new alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy and centrally planned economy that is based on collaborative selfmanagement common ownership of resources and the production of usevalues through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital Anarchocommunism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state private property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production Anarchosyndicalism was practised in Catalonia and other places in the Spanish Revolution during the Spanish Civil War Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution The economy of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia established a system based on marketbased allocation social ownership of the means of production and selfmanagement within firms This system substituted Yugoslavias Soviettype central planning with a decentralised selfmanaged system after reforms in 1953 The Marxian economist Richard D Wolff argues that reorganising production so that workers become collectively selfdirected at their worksites not only moves society beyond both capitalism and state socialism of the last century but would also mark another milestone in human history similar to earlier transitions out of slavery and feudalism As an example Wolff claims that Mondragon is a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organisation of production Statedirected economy State socialism can be used to classify any variety of socialist philosophies that advocates the ownership of the means of production by the state apparatus either as a transitional stage between capitalism and socialism or as an endgoal in itself Typically it refers to a form of technocratic management whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society and the public interest instead of workers councils or workplace democracy A statedirected economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries as promoted by various Social democratic political parties during the 20th century This ideology influenced the policies of the British Labour Party during Clement Attlees administration In the biography of the 1945 United Kingdom Labour Party Prime Minister Clement Attlee Francis Beckett states The government wanted what would become known as a mixed economy Nationalisation in the United Kingdom was achieved through compulsory purchase of the industry ie with compensation British Aerospace was a combination of major aircraft companies British Aircraft Corporation Hawker Siddeley and others British Shipbuilders was a combination of the major shipbuilding companies including Cammell Laird Govan Shipbuilders Swan Hunter and Yarrow Shipbuilders whereas the nationalisation of the coal mines in 1947 created a coal board charged with running the coal industry commercially so as to be able to meet the interest payable on the bonds which the former mine owners shares had been converted into Market socialism Market socialism consists of publicly owned or cooperatively owned enterprises operating in a market economy It is a system that uses the market and monetary prices for the allocation and accounting of the means of production thereby retaining the process of capital accumulation The profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees collectively sustain the enterprise or finance public institutions In stateoriented forms of market socialism in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a social dividend eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems Neoclassical economist Lon Walras believed that a socialist economy based on state ownership of land and natural resources would provide a means of public finance to make income taxes unnecessary Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker selfmanagement Some of the economic reforms introduced during the Prague Spring by Alexander Dubek the leader of Czechoslovakia included elements of market socialism Mutualism is an economic theory and anarchist school of thought that advocates a society where each person might possess a means of production either individually or collectively with trade representing equivalent amounts of labour in the free market Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutualcredit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate just high enough to cover administration Mutualism is based on a labour theory of value that holds that when labour or its product is sold in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying the amount of labour necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility The current economic system in China is formally referred to as a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics It combines a large state sector that comprises the commanding heights of the economy which are guaranteed their public ownership status by law with a private sector mainly engaged in commodity production and light industry responsible from anywhere between 33 to over 70 of GDP generated in 2005 Although there has been a rapid expansion of privatesector activity since the 1980s privatisation of state assets was virtually halted and were partially reversed in 2005 The current Chinese economy consists of 150 corporatised stateowned enterprises that report directly to Chinas central government By 2008 these stateowned corporations had become increasingly dynamic and generated large increases in revenue for the state resulting in a statesector led recovery during the 2009 financial crises while accounting for most of Chinas economic growth The Chinese economic model is widely cited as a contemporary form of state capitalism the major difference between Western capitalism and the Chinese model being the degree of stateownership of shares in publicly listed corporations The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has adopted a similar model after the Doi Moi economic renovation but slightly differs from the Chinese model in that the Vietnamese government retains firm control over the state sector and strategic industries but allows for privatesector activity in commodity production Politics While major socialist political movements include anarchism communism the labour movement Marxism social democracy and syndicalism independent socialist theorists utopian socialist authors and academic supporters of socialism may not be represented in these movements Some political groups have called themselves socialist while holding views that some consider antithetical to socialism Socialist has been used by members of the political right as an epithet including against individuals who do not consider themselves to be socialists and against policies that are not considered socialist by their proponents While there are many variations of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of socialism there have been common elements identified by scholars In his Dictionary of Socialism 1924 Angelo S Rappoport analysed forty definitions of socialism to conclude that common elements of socialism include general criticism of the social effects of private ownership and control of capitalas being the cause of poverty low wages unemployment economic and social inequality and a lack of economic security a general view that the solution to these problems is a form of collective control over the means of production distribution and exchange the degree and means of control vary among socialist movements an agreement that the outcome of this collective control should be a society based upon social justice including social equality economic protection of people and should provide a more satisfying life for most people In The Concepts of Socialism 1975 Bhikhu Parekh identifies four core principles of socialism and particularly socialist society namely sociality social responsibility cooperation and planning In his study Ideologies and Political Theory 1996 Michael Freeden states that all socialists share five themes the first is that socialism posits that society is more than a mere collection of individuals second that it considers human welfare a desirable objective third that it considers humans by nature to be active and productive fourth it holds the belief of human equality and fifth that history is progressive and will create positive change on the condition that humans work to achieve such change Anarchism Anarchism advocates stateless societies often defined as selfgoverned voluntary institutions but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on nonhierarchical free associations While anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary or harmful it is not the central aspect Anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations including the state system Mutualists support market socialism collectivist anarchists favour workers cooperatives and salaries based on the amount of time contributed to production anarchocommunists advocate a direct transition from capitalism to libertarian communism and a gift economy and anarchosyndicalists prefer workers direct action and the general strike The authoritarianlibertarian struggles and disputes within the socialist movement go back to the First International and the expulsion in 1872 of the anarchists who went on to lead the Antiauthoritarian International and then founded their own libertarian international the Anarchist St Imier International In 1888 the individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker who proclaimed himself to be an anarchistic socialist and libertarian socialist in opposition to the authoritarian state socialism and the compulsory communism included the full text of a Socialistic Letter by Ernest Lesigne in his essay on State Socialism and Anarchism According to Lesigne there are two types of socialism One is dictatorial the other libertarian Tuckers two socialisms were the authoritarian state socialism which he associated to the Marxist school and the libertarian anarchist socialism or simply anarchism that he advocated Tucker noted that the fact that the authoritarian State Socialism has overshadowed other forms of Socialism gives it no right to a monopoly of the Socialistic idea According to Tucker what those two schools of socialism had in common was the labor theory of value and the ends by which anarchism pursued different means According to anarchists such as the authors of An Anarchist FAQ anarchism is one of the many traditions of socialism For anarchists and other antiauthoritarian socialists socialism can only mean a classless and antiauthoritarian ie libertarian society in which people manage their own affairs either as individuals or as part of a group depending on the situation In other words it implies selfmanagement in all aspects of life including at the workplace Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many socialist traditions Peter Marshall argues that in general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp but it also has outriders in liberalism It cannot be reduced to socialism and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine Democratic socialism and social democracy Democratic socialism represents any socialist movement that seeks to establish an economy based on economic democracy by and for the working class Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral reformist or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one According to Christopher Pierson if the contrast which 1989 highlights is not that between socialism in the East and liberal democracy in the West the latter must be recognised to have been shaped reformed and compromised by a century of social democratic pressure Pierson further claims that social democratic and socialist parties within the constitutional arena in the West have almost always been involved in a politics of compromise with existing capitalist institutions to whatever far distant prize its eyes might from time to time have been lifted For Pierson if advocates of the death of socialism accept that social democrats belong within the socialist camp as I think they must then the contrast between socialism in all its variants and liberal democracy must collapse For actually existing liberal democracy is in substantial part a product of socialist social democratic forces Social democracy is a socialist tradition of political thought Many social democrats refer to themselves as socialists or democratic socialists and some such as Tony Blair employ these terms interchangeably Others found clear differences between the three terms and prefer to describe their own political beliefs by using the term social democracy The two main directions were to establish democratic socialism or to build first a welfare state within the capitalist system The first variant advances democratic socialism through reformist and gradualist methods In the second variant social democracy is a policy regime involving a welfare state collective bargaining schemes support for publicly financed public services and a mixed economy It is often used in this manner to refer to Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century It was described by Jerry Mander as hybrid economics an active collaboration of capitalist and socialist visions Some studies and surveys indicate that people tend to live happier and healthier lives in social democratic societies rather than neoliberal ones Social democrats advocate a peaceful evolutionary transition of the economy to socialism through progressive social reform It asserts that the only acceptable constitutional form of government is representative democracy under the rule of law It promotes extending democratic decisionmaking beyond political democracy to include economic democracy to guarantee employees and other economic stakeholders sufficient rights of codetermination It supports a mixed economy that opposes inequality poverty and oppression while rejecting both a totally unregulated market economy or a fully planned economy Common social democratic policies include universal social rights and universally accessible public services such as education health care workers compensation and other services including child care and elder care Socialist child care and elderly care systems allow citizens to take a more active role in building a socialist society especially women Social democracy supports the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers Most social democratic parties are affiliated with the Socialist International Modern democratic socialism is a broad political movement that seeks to promote the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system Some democratic socialists support social democracy as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism to make it more equitable and humane while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is relegated to the indefinite future According to Sheri Berman Marxism is loosely held to be valuable for its emphasis on changing the world for a more just better future The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology although there are a few key differences The major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics in that contemporary social democrats support a welfare state and unemployment insurance as well as other practical progressive reforms of capitalism and are more concerned to administrate and humanise it On the other hand democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system arguing that any attempt to humanise capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions Ethical and liberal socialism Ethical socialism appeals to socialism on ethical and moral grounds as opposed to economic egoistic and consumeristic grounds It emphasizes the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of altruism cooperation and social justice while opposing possessive individualism Ethical socialism has been the official philosophy of mainstream socialist parties Liberal socialism incorporates liberal principles to socialism It has been compared to postwar social democracy for its support of a mixed economy that includes both public and private capital goods While democratic socialism and social democracy are anticapitalist positions insofar as criticism of capitalism is linked to the private ownership of the means of production liberal socialism identifies artificial and legalistic monopolies to be the fault of capitalism and opposes an entirely unregulated market economy It considers both liberty and social equality to be compatible and mutually dependent Principles that can be described as ethical or liberal socialist have been based upon or developed by philosophers such as John Stuart Mill Eduard Bernstein John Dewey Carlo Rosselli Norberto Bobbio and Chantal Mouffe Other important liberal socialist figures include Guido Calogero Piero Gobetti Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse John Maynard Keynes and R H Tawney Liberal socialism has been particularly prominent in British and Italian politics Leninism and precedents Blanquism is a conception of revolution named for Louis Auguste Blanqui It holds that socialist revolution should be carried out by a relatively small group of highly organised and secretive conspirators Upon seizing power the revolutionaries introduce socialism Rosa Luxemburg and Eduard Bernstein criticised Lenin stating that his conception of revolution was elitist and Blanquist MarxismLeninism combines Marxs scientific socialist concepts and Lenins antiimperialism democratic centralism vanguardism and the principle of He who does not work neither shall he eat Hal Draper defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an elite administration to run the socialist state The other side of socialism is a more democratic socialism from below The idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from beloweven if that is the Marxist idealbecause it is more practical Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer more Marxist version of socialism According to Draper Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was conducive to superstitious authoritarianism Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between reformist or revolutionary peaceful or violent democratic or authoritarian etc and further identifies six major varieties of socialism from above among them Philanthropism Elitism Pannism Communism Permeationism and SocialismfromOutside According to Arthur Lipow Marx and Engels were the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism described as a form of socialism from below that is based on a mass workingclass movement fighting from below for the extension of democracy and human freedom This type of socialism is contrasted to that of the authoritarian antidemocratic creed and the various totalitarian collectivist ideologies which claim the title of socialism as well as the many varieties of socialism from above which have led in the twentieth century to movements and state forms in which a despotic new class rules over a stratified economy in the name of socialism a division that runs through the history of the socialist movement Lipow identifies Bellamyism and Stalinism as two prominent authoritarian socialist currents within the history of the socialist movement Trotsky viewed himself to be an adherent of Leninism but opposed the bureaucratic and authoritarian methods of Stalin A number of scholars and Western socialists have regarded Leon Trotsky as a democratic alternative rather than a forerunner to Stalin with particular emphasis drawn to his activities in the preCivil War period and as leader of the Left Opposition More specifically Trotsky advocated for a decentralised form of economic planning mass soviet democratizationworkers control of production elected representation of Soviet socialist parties the tactic of a united front against farright parties cultural autonomy for artistic movements voluntary collectivisation a transitional program and socialist internationalism Several scholars state that in practice the Soviet model functioned as a form of state capitalism Libertarian socialism Libertarian socialism sometimes called leftlibertarianism social anarchism and socialist libertarianism is an antiauthoritarian antistatist and libertarian tradition within socialism that rejects centralised state ownership and control including criticism of wage labour relationships wage slavery as well as the state itself It emphasises workers selfmanagement and decentralised structures of political organisation Libertarian socialism asserts that a society based on freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control production Libertarian socialists generally prefer direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism citizens assemblies trade unions and workers councils Anarchosyndicalist Gaston Leval explained We therefore foresee a Society in which all activities will be coordinated a structure that has at the same time sufficient flexibility to permit the greatest possible autonomy for social life or for the life of each enterprise and enough cohesiveness to prevent all disorder In a wellorganised society all of these things must be systematically accomplished by means of parallel federations vertically united at the highest levels constituting one vast organism in which all economic functions will be performed in solidarity with all others and that will permanently preserve the necessary cohesion All of this is typically done within a general call for libertarian and voluntary free associations through the identification criticism and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life As part of the larger socialist movement it seeks to distinguish itself from Bolshevism Leninism and MarxismLeninism as well as social democracy Past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include anarchism anarchocommunism anarchosyndicalism collectivist anarchism individualist anarchism and mutualism autonomism Communalism participism libertarian Marxism council communism and Luxemburgism revolutionary syndicalism and utopian socialism Fourierism Religious socialism Christian socialism is a broad concept involving an intertwining of Christian religion with socialism Islamic socialism is a more spiritual form of socialism Muslim socialists believe that the teachings of the Quran and Muhammad are not only compatible with but actively promoting the principles of equality and public ownership drawing inspiration from the early Medina welfare state he established Muslim socialists are more conservative than their Western contemporaries and find their roots in antiimperialism anticolonialism and sometimes if in an Arab speaking country Arab nationalism Islamic socialists believe in deriving legitimacy from political mandate as opposed to religious texts Social movements Socialist feminism is a branch of feminism that argues that liberation can only be achieved by working to end both economic and cultural sources of womens oppression Marxist feminisms foundation was laid by Engels in The Origin of the Family Private Property and the State 1884 August Bebels Woman under Socialism 1879 is the single work dealing with sexuality most widely read by rankandfile members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany SPD In the late 19th and early 20th centuries both Clara Zetkin and Eleanor Marx were against the demonisation of men and supported a proletariat revolution that would overcome as many malefemale inequalities as possible As their movement already had the most radical demands in womens equality most Marxist leaders including Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai counterposed Marxism against liberal feminism rather than trying to combine them Anarchafeminism began with late 19th and early 20thcentury authors and theorists such as anarchist feminists Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre In the Spanish Civil War an anarchafeminist group Mujeres Libres Free Women linked to the Federacin Anarquista Ibrica organised to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas In 1972 the Chicago Womens Liberation Union published Socialist Feminism A Strategy for the Womens Movement which is believed to be the first published use of the term socialist feminism Many socialists were early advocates of LGBT rights For early socialist Charles Fourier true freedom could only occur without suppressing passions as the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual but to society as a whole Writing before the advent of the term homosexuality Fourier recognised that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives including samesex sexuality and andrognit He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that affirming ones difference can actually enhance social integration In Oscar Wildes The Soul of Man Under Socialism he advocates an egalitarian society where wealth is shared by all while warning of the dangers of social systems that crush individuality Edward Carpenter actively campaigned for homosexual rights His work The Intermediate Sex A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women was a 1908 book arguing for gay liberation who was an influential personality in the foundation of the Fabian Society and the Labour Party After the Russian Revolution under the leadership of Lenin and Trotsky the Soviet Union abolished previous laws against homosexuality Harry Hay was an early leader in the American LGBT rights movement as well as a member of the Communist Party USA He is known for his involvement in the founding of gay organisations including the Mattachine Society the first sustained gay rights group in the United States which in its early days reflected a strong Marxist influence The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality reports that as Marxists the founders of the group believed that the injustice and oppression which they suffered stemmed from relationships deeply embedded in the structure of American society Emerging from events such as the May 1968 insurrection in France the antiVietnam war movement in the US and the Stonewall riots of 1969 militant gay liberation organisations began to spring up around the world Many sprang from left radicalism more than established homophile groups although the Gay Liberation Front took an anticapitalist stance and attacked the nuclear family and traditional gender roles Ecosocialism is a political strain merging aspects of socialism Marxism or libertarian socialism with green politics ecology and alterglobalisation Ecosocialists generally claim that the expansion of the capitalist system is the cause of social exclusion poverty war and environmental degradation through globalisation and imperialism under the supervision of repressive states and transnational structures Contrary to the depiction of Karl Marx by some environmentalists social ecologists and fellow socialists as a productivist who favoured the domination of nature ecosocialists revisited Marxs writings and believe that he was a main originator of the ecological worldview Marx discussed a metabolic rift between man and nature stating that private ownership of the globe by single individuals will appear quite absurd as private ownership of one man by another and his observation that a society must hand it the planet down to succeeding generations in an improved condition English socialist William Morris is credited with developing principles of what was later called ecosocialism During the 1880s and 1890s Morris promoted his ideas within the Social Democratic Federation and Socialist League Green anarchism blends anarchism with environmental issues An important early influence was Henry David Thoreau and his book Walden as well as lise Reclus In the late 19th century anarchonaturism fused anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in France Spain Cuba and Portugal Murray Bookchins first book Our Synthetic Environment was followed by his essay Ecology and Revolutionary Thought which introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics In the 1970s Barry Commoner claimed that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation as opposed to population pressures In the 1990s socialistfeminists Mary Mellor and Ariel Salleh adopt an ecosocialist paradigm An environmentalism of the poor combining ecological awareness and social justice has also become prominent Pepper critiqued the current approach of many within green politics particularly deep ecologists Syndicalism Syndicalism operates through industrial trade unions It rejects state socialism and the use of establishment politics Syndicalists reject state power in favour of strategies such as the general strike Syndicalists advocate a socialist economy based on federated unions or syndicates of workers who own and manage the means of production Some Marxist currents advocate syndicalism such as De Leonism Anarchosyndicalism views syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy The Spanish Revolution was largely orchestrated by the anarchosyndicalist trade union CNT The International Workers Association is an international federation of anarchosyndicalist labour unions and initiatives Public views A multitude of polls have found significant levels of support for socialism among modern populations A 2018 IPSOS poll found that 50 of the respondents globally strongly or somewhat agreed that present socialist values were of great value for societal progress In China this was 84 India 72 Malaysia 62 Turkey 62 South Africa 57 Brazil 57 Russia 55 Spain 54 Argentina 52 Mexico 51 Saudi Arabia 51 Sweden 49 Canada 49 Great Britain 49 Australia 49 Poland 48 Chile 48 South Korea 48 Peru 48 Italy 47 Serbia 47 Germany 45 Belgium 44 Romania 40 United States 39 France 31 Hungary 28 and Japan 21 A 2021 survey conducted by the Institute of Economic Affairs IEA found that 67 of young British 1624 respondents wanted to live in a socialist economic system 72 supported the renationalisation of various industries such as energy water along with railways and 75 agreed with the view that climate change was a specifically capitalist problem A 2023 IPSOS poll found that a majority of British public favoured public ownership of utilities including water rail and electricity Specifically 68 of respondents favoured the nationalisation of water services 65 supporting the nationalisation of the railways 63 supporting the public ownership of power networks and 39 favouring broadband access which is operated by the government The poll also found broad levels of support among traditional Labour and Conservative voters The results of a 2019 Axios poll found that 70 of US millennials were willing to vote for a socialist candidate and 50 of this same demographic had a somewhat or very unfavourable view of capitalism Subsequently another 2021 Axios poll found that 51 of 1834 US adults had a positive view of socialism Yet 41 of Americans more generally had a positive view of socialism compared to 52 of those who viewing socialism more negatively In 2023 the Fraser Institute published findings which found that 42 of Canadians viewed socialism as the ideal system compared to 43 of British respondents 40 Australian respondents and 31 American respondents Overall support for socialism ranged from 50 of Canadians 1824 year olds to 28 of Canadians over 55 Criticism According to analytical Marxist sociologist Erik Olin Wright The Right condemned socialism as violating individual rights to private property and unleashing monstrous forms of state oppression while the Left saw it as opening up new vistas of social equality genuine freedom and the development of human potentials Because of socialisms many varieties most critiques have focused on a specific approach Proponents of one approach typically criticise others Socialism has been criticised in terms of its models of economic organization as well as its political and social implications Other critiques are directed at the socialist movement parties or existing states Some forms of criticism occupy theoretical grounds such as in the economic calculation problem presented by proponents of the Austrian School as part of the socialist calculation debate while others support their criticism by examining historical attempts to establish socialist societies The economic calculation problem concerns the feasibility and methods of resource allocation for a planned socialist system Central planning is also criticized by elements of the radical left Libertarian socialist economist Robin Hahnel notes that even if central planning overcame its inherent inhibitions of incentives and innovation it would nevertheless be unable to maximize economic democracy and selfmanagement which he believes are concepts that are more intellectually coherent consistent and just than mainstream notions of economic freedom Economic liberals and rightlibertarians argue that private ownership of the means of production and market exchange are natural entities or moral rights which are central to freedom and liberty and argue that the economic dynamics of capitalism are immutable and absolute As such they also argue that public ownership of the means of production and economic planning are infringements upon liberty Critics of socialism have argued that in any society where everyone holds equal wealth there can be no material incentive to work because one does not receive rewards for a work well done They further argue that incentives increase productivity for all people and that the loss of those effects would lead to stagnation Some critics of socialism argue that income sharing reduces individual incentives to work and therefore incomes should be individualized as much as possible Some philosophers have also criticized the aims of socialism arguing that equality erodes away at individual diversities and that the establishment of an equal society would have to entail strong coercion Milton Friedman argued that the absence of private economic activity would enable political leaders to grant themselves coercive powers powers that under a capitalist system would instead be granted by a capitalist class which Friedman found preferable Many commentators on the political right point to the mass killings under communist regimes claiming them as an indictment of socialism Opponents of this view including supporters of socialism state that these killings were aberrations caused by specific authoritarian regimes and not caused by socialism itself and draw comparisons to killings famines and excess deaths under capitalism colonialism and anticommunist authoritarian governments See also References

    title: "Communism",
    originalContent:
      "Communism from Latin communis common universal is a sociopolitical philosophical and economic ideology within the socialist movement whose goal is the creation of a communist society a socioeconomic order centered around common ownership of the means of production distribution and exchange that allocates products to everyone in society based on need A communist society would entail the absence of private property and social classes and ultimately money and the state or nation state Communists often seek a voluntary state of selfgovernance but disagree on the means to this end This reflects a distinction between a libertarian socialist approach of communization revolutionary spontaneity and workers selfmanagement and an authoritarian socialist vanguardist or partydriven approach under a socialist state which is eventually expected to wither away Communist parties and movements have been described as radical left or farleft Variants of communism have been developed throughout history including anarchist communism Marxist schools of thought and religious communism among others Communism encompasses a variety of schools of thought which broadly include Marxism Leninism and libertarian communism as well as the political ideologies grouped around those All of these different ideologies generally share the analysis that the current order of society stems from capitalism its economic system and mode of production that in this system there are two major social classes that the relationship between these two classes is exploitative and that this situation can only ultimately be resolved through a social revolution The two classes are the proletariat who make up the majority of the population within society and must sell their labor power to survive and the bourgeoisie a small minority that derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production According to this analysis a communist revolution would put the working class in power and in turn establish common ownership of property the primary element in the transformation of society towards a communist mode of production Communism in its modern form grew out of the socialist movement in 18thcentury France in the aftermath of the French Revolution Criticism of the idea of private property in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century through such thinkers as Gabriel Bonnot de Mably Jean Meslier tienneGabriel Morelly Henri de SaintSimon and JeanJacques Rousseau in France During the upheaval of the French Revolution communism emerged as a political doctrine under the auspices of FranoisNol Babeuf Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne and Sylvain Marchal all of whom can be considered the progenitors of modern communism according to James H Billington In the 20th century several ostensibly Communist governments espousing MarxismLeninism and its variants came into power first in the Soviet Union with the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then in portions of Eastern Europe Asia and a few other regions after World War II As one of the many types of socialism communism became the dominant political tendency along with social democracy within the international socialist movement by the early 1920s During most of the 20th century around onethird of the worlds population lived under Communist governments These governments were characterized by oneparty rule by a communist party the rejection of private property and capitalism state control of economic activity and mass media restrictions on freedom of religion and suppression of opposition and dissent With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 several previously Communist governments repudiated or abolished Communist rule altogether Afterwards only a small number of nominally Communist governments remained such as China Cuba Laos North Korea and Vietnam With the exception of North Korea all of these states have started allowing more economic competition while maintaining oneparty rule The decline of communism in the late 20th century has been attributed to the inherent inefficiencies of communist economies and the general trend of communist governments towards authoritarianism and bureaucracy While the emergence of the Soviet Union as the worlds first nominally Communist state led to communisms widespread association with the Soviet economic model several scholars posit that in practice the model functioned as a form of state capitalism Public memory of 20thcentury Communist states has been described as a battleground between anti anticommunism and anticommunism Many authors have written about mass killings under communist regimes and mortality rates such as excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin which remain controversial polarized and debated topics in academia historiography and politics when discussing communism and the legacy of Communist states Etymology and terminology Communism derives from the French word communisme a combination of the Latin word communis which literally means common and the suffix isme an act practice or process of doing something Semantically communis can be translated to of or for the community while isme is a suffix that indicates the abstraction into a state condition action or doctrine Communism may be interpreted as the state of being of or for the community this semantic constitution has led to numerous usages of the word in its evolution Prior to becoming associated with its more modern conception of an economic and political organization it was initially used to designate various social situations After 1848 communism came to be primarily associated with Marxism most specifically embodied in The Communist Manifesto which proposed a particular type of communism One of the first uses of the word in its modern sense is in a letter sent by Victor dHupay to Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne around 1785 in which dHupay describes himself as an auteur communiste communist author In 1793 Restif first used communisme to describe a social order based on egalitarianism and the common ownership of property Restif would go on to use the term frequently in his writing and was the first to describe communism as a form of government John Goodwyn Barmby is credited with the first use of communism in English around 1840 Communism and socialism Since the 1840s the term communism has usually been distinguished from socialism The modern definition and usage of the term socialism was settled by the 1860s becoming predominant over alternative terms such as associationism Fourierism mutualism or cooperative which had previously been used as synonyms Meanwhile the term communism fell out of use during this period An early distinction between communism and socialism was that the latter aimed to only socialize production whereas the former aimed to socialize both production and consumption in the form of common access to final goods This distinction can be observed in Marxs communism where the distribution of products is based on the principle of to each according to his needs in contrast to a socialist principle of to each according to his contribution Socialism has been described as a philosophy seeking distributive justice and communism as a subset of socialism that prefers economic equality as its form of distributive justice In 19th century Europe the use of the terms communism and socialism eventually accorded with the cultural attitude of adherents and opponents towards religion In European Christendom communism was believed to be the atheist way of life In Protestant England communism was too phonetically similar to the Roman Catholic communion rite hence English atheists denoted themselves socialists Friedrich Engels stated that in 1848 at the time when The Communist Manifesto was first published socialism was respectable on the continent while communism was not the Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France were considered respectable socialists while workingclass movements that proclaimed the necessity of total social change denoted themselves communists This latter branch of socialism produced the communist work of tienne Cabet in France and Wilhelm Weitling in Germany While liberal democrats looked to the Revolutions of 1848 as a democratic revolution which in the long run ensured liberty equality and fraternity Marxists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of workingclass ideals by a bourgeoisie indifferent to the legitimate demands of the proletariat By 1888 Marxists employed the term socialism in place of communism which had come to be considered an oldfashioned synonym for the former It was not until 1917 with the October Revolution that socialism came to be used to refer to a distinct stage between capitalism and communism This intermediate stage was a concept introduced by Vladimir Lenin as a means to defend the Bolshevik seizure of power against traditional Marxist criticism that Russias productive forces were not sufficiently developed for socialist revolution A distinction between communist and socialist as descriptors of political ideologies arose in 1918 after the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party renamed itself as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union which resulted in the adjective Communist being used to refer to socialists who supported the politics and theories of Bolshevism Leninism and later in the 1920s those of MarxismLeninism In spite of this common usage Communist parties also continued to describe themselves as socialists dedicated to socialism According to The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx Marx used many terms to refer to a postcapitalist society positive humanism socialism Communism realm of free individuality free association of producers etc He used these terms completely interchangeably The notion that socialism and Communism are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death According to the Encyclopdia Britannica Exactly how communism differs from socialism has long been a matter of debate but the distinction rests largely on the communists adherence to the revolutionary socialism of Karl Marx Associated usage and Communist states In the United States communism is widely used as a pejorative term as part of a Red Scare much like socialism and mainly in reference to authoritarian socialism and Communist states The emergence of the Soviet Union as the worlds first nominally Communist state led to the terms widespread association with MarxismLeninism and the Soviettype economic planning model In his essay Judging Nazism and Communism Martin Malia defines a generic Communism category as any Communist political party movement led by intellectuals this umbrella term allows grouping together such different regimes as radical Soviet industrialism and the Khmer Rouges antiurbanism According to Alexander Dallin the idea to group together different countries such as Afghanistan and Hungary has no adequate explanation While the term Communist state is used by Western historians political scientists and news media to refer to countries ruled by Communist parties these socialist states themselves did not describe themselves as communist or claim to have achieved communism they referred to themselves as being a socialist state that is in the process of constructing communism Terms used by Communist states include nationaldemocratic peoples democratic socialistoriented and workers and peasants states History Early communism According to Richard Pipes the idea of a classless egalitarian society first emerged in ancient Greece Since the 20th century ancient Rome has been examined in this context as well as thinkers such as Aristotle Cicero Demosthenes Plato and Tacitus Plato in particular has been considered as a possible communist or socialist theorist or as the first author to give communism a serious consideration The 5thcentury Mazdak movement in Persia modernday Iran has been described as communistic for challenging the enormous privileges of the noble classes and the clergy criticizing the institution of private property and striving to create an egalitarian society At one time or another various small communist communities existed generally under the inspiration of religious text In the medieval Christian Church some monastic communities and religious orders shared their land and their other property Sects deemed heretical such as the Waldensians preached an early form of Christian communism As summarized by historians Janzen Rod and Max Stanton the Hutterites believed in strict adherence to biblical principles church discipline and practised a form of communism In their words the Hutterites established in their communities a rigorous system of Ordnungen which were codes of rules and regulations that governed all aspects of life and ensured a unified perspective As an economic system communism was attractive to many of the peasants who supported social revolution in sixteenth century central Europe This link was highlighted in one of Karl Marxs early writings Marx stated that as Christ is the intermediary unto whom man unburdens all his divinity all his religious bonds so the state is the mediator unto which he transfers all his Godlessness all his human liberty Thomas Mntzer led a large Anabaptist communist movement during the German Peasants War which Friedrich Engels analyzed in his 1850 work The Peasant War in Germany The Marxist communist ethos that aims for unity reflects the Christian universalist teaching that humankind is one and that there is only one god who does not discriminate among people Communist thought has also been traced back to the works of the 16thcentury English writer Thomas More In his 1516 treatise titled Utopia More portrayed a society based on common ownership of property whose rulers administered it through the application of reason and virtue Marxist communist theoretician Karl Kautsky who popularized Marxist communism in Western Europe more than any other thinker apart from Engels published Thomas More and His Utopia a work about More whose ideas could be regarded as the foregleam of Modern Socialism according to Kautsky During the October Revolution in Russia Vladimir Lenin suggested that a monument be dedicated to More alongside other important Western thinkers In the 17th century communist thought surfaced again in England where a Puritan religious group known as the Diggers advocated the abolition of private ownership of land In his 1895 Cromwell and Communism Eduard Bernstein stated that several groups during the English Civil War especially the Diggers espoused clear communistic agrarianist ideals and that Oliver Cromwells attitude towards these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century through such thinkers as Gabriel Bonnot de Mably Jean Meslier tienneGabriel Morelly and JeanJacques Rousseau in France During the upheaval of the French Revolution communism emerged as a political doctrine under the auspices of FranoisNol Babeuf Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne and Sylvain Marchal all of whom can be considered the progenitors of modern communism according to James H Billington In the early 19th century various social reformers founded communities based on common ownership Unlike many previous communist communities they replaced the religious emphasis with a rational and philanthropic basis Notable among them were Robert Owen who founded New Harmony Indiana in 1825 and Charles Fourier whose followers organized other settlements in the United States such as Brook Farm in 1841 In its modern form communism grew out of the socialist movement in 19thcentury Europe As the Industrial Revolution advanced socialist critics blamed capitalism for the misery of the proletariat a new class of urban factory workers who labored under oftenhazardous conditions Foremost among these critics were Marx and his associate Engels In 1848 Marx and Engels offered a new definition of communism and popularized the term in their famous pamphlet The Communist Manifesto Revolutionary wave of 19171923 In 1917 the October Revolution in Russia set the conditions for the rise to state power of Vladimir Lenins Bolsheviks which was the first time any avowedly communist party reached that position The revolution transferred power to the AllRussian Congress of Soviets in which the Bolsheviks had a majority The event generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement as Marx stated that socialism and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development however the Russian Empire was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers Marx warned against attempts to transform my historical sketch of the genesis of capitalism in Western Europe into a historicophilosophy theory of the arche gnrale imposed by fate upon every people whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself and stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeois rule through the Obshchina The moderate Mensheviks minority opposed Lenins Bolsheviks majority plan for socialist revolution before the capitalist mode of production was more fully developed The Bolsheviks successful rise to power was based upon the slogans such as Peace Bread and Land which tapped into the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in World War I the peasants demand for land reform and popular support for the soviets 50000 workers had passed a resolution in favour of Bolshevik demand for transfer of power to the soviets Lenins government also instituted a number of progressive measures such as universal education healthcare and equal rights for women The initial stage of the October Revolution which involved the assault on Petrograd occurred largely without any human casualties By November 1917 the Russian Provisional Government had been widely discredited by its failure to withdraw from World War I implement land reform or convene the Russian Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution leaving the soviets in de facto control of the country The Bolsheviks moved to hand power to the Second AllRussian Congress of Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies in the October Revolution after a few weeks of deliberation the Left SocialistRevolutionaries formed a coalition government with the Bolsheviks from November 1917 to July 1918 while the rightwing faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party boycotted the soviets and denounced the October Revolution as an illegal coup In the 1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election socialist parties totaled well over 70 of the vote The Bolsheviks were clear winners in the urban centres and took around twothirds of the votes of soldiers on the Western Front obtaining 233 of the vote the Socialist Revolutionaries finished first on the strength of support from the countrys rural peasantry who were for the most part single issue voters that issue being land reform obtaining 376 while the Ukrainian Socialist Bloc finished a distant third at 127 and the Mensheviks obtained a disappointing fourth place at 30 Most of the Socialist Revolutionary Partys seats went to the rightwing faction Citing outdated voterrolls which did not acknowledge the party split and the assemblys conflicts with the Congress of Soviets the BolshevikLeft SocialistRevolutionaries government moved to dissolve the Constituent Assembly in January 1918 The Draft Decree on the Dissolution of the Constituent Assembly was issued by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union a committee dominated by Lenin who had previously supported a multiparty system of free elections After the Bolshevik defeat Lenin started referring to the assembly as a deceptive form of bourgeoisdemocratic parliamentarianism Some argued this was the beginning of the development of vanguardism as an hierarchical partyelite that controls society which resulted in a split between anarchism and Marxism and Leninist communism assuming the dominant position for most of the 20th century excluding rival socialist currents Other communists and Marxists especially social democrats who favored the development of liberal democracy as a prerequisite to socialism were critical of the Bolsheviks from the beginning due to Russia being seen as too backward for a socialist revolution Council communism and left communism inspired by the German Revolution of 19181919 and the wide proletarian revolutionary wave arose in response to developments in Russia and are critical of selfdeclared constitutionally socialist states Some leftwing parties such as the Socialist Party of Great Britain boasted of having called the Bolsheviks and by extension those Communist states which either followed or were inspired by the Soviet Bolshevik model of development establishing state capitalism in late 1917 as would be described during the 20th century by several academics economists and other scholars or a command economy Before the Soviet path of development became known as socialism in reference to the twostage theory communists made no major distinction between the socialist mode of production and communism it is consistent with and helped to inform early concepts of socialism in which the law of value no longer directs economic activity Monetary relations in the form of exchangevalue profit interest and wage labor would not operate and apply to Marxist socialism While Joseph Stalin stated that the law of value would still apply to socialism and that the Soviet Union was socialist under this new definition which was followed by other Communist leaders many other communists maintain the original definition and state that Communist states never established socialism in this sense Lenin described his policies as state capitalism but saw them as necessary for the development of socialism which leftwing critics say was never established while some MarxistLeninists state that it was established only during the Stalin era and Mao era and then became capitalist states ruled by revisionists others state that Maoist China was always state capitalist and uphold Peoples Socialist Republic of Albania as the only socialist state after the Soviet Union under Stalin who first stated to have achieved socialism with the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union Communist states Soviet Union War communism was the first system adopted by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War as a result of the many challenges Despite communism in the name it had nothing to do with communism with strict discipline for workers strike actions forbidden obligatory labor duty and militarystyle control and has been described as simple authoritarian control by the Bolsheviks to maintain power and control in the Soviet regions rather than any coherent political ideology The Soviet Union was established in 1922 Before the broad ban in 1921 there were several factions in the Communist party more prominently among them the Left Opposition the Right Opposition and the Workers Opposition which debated on the path of development to follow The Left and Workers oppositions were more critical of the statecapitalist development and the Workers in particular was critical of bureaucratization and development from above while the Right Opposition was more supporting of statecapitalist development and advocated the New Economic Policy Following Lenins democratic centralism the Leninist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis with active cells of members as the broad base They were made up only of elite cadres approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to party discipline Trotskyism overtook the left communists as the main dissident communist current while more libertarian communisms dating back to the libertarian Marxist current of council communism remained important dissident communisms outside the Soviet Union Following Lenins democratic centralism the Leninist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis with active cells of members as the broad base They were made up only of elite cadres approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to party discipline The Great Purge of 19361938 was Joseph Stalins attempt to destroy any possible opposition within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union In the Moscow trials many old Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution or in Lenins Soviet government afterwards including Lev Kamenev Grigory Zinoviev Alexei Rykov and Nikolai Bukharin were accused pleaded guilty of conspiracy against the Soviet Union and were executed The devastation of World War II resulted in a massive recovery program involving the rebuilding of industrial plants housing and transportation as well as the demobilization and migration of millions of soldiers and civilians In the midst of this turmoil during the winter of 19461947 the Soviet Union experienced the worst natural famine in the 20th century There was no serious opposition to Stalin as the secret police continued to send possible suspects to the gulag Relations with the United States and Britain went from friendly to hostile as they denounced Stalins political controls over eastern Europe and his Berlin Blockade By 1947 the Cold War had begun Stalin himself believed that capitalism was a hollow shell and would crumble under increased nonmilitary pressure exerted through proxies in countries like Italy He greatly underestimated the economic strength of the West and instead of triumph saw the West build up alliances that were designed to permanently stop or contain Soviet expansion In early 1950 Stalin gave the goahead for North Koreas invasion of South Korea expecting a short war He was stunned when the Americans entered and defeated the North Koreans putting them almost on the Soviet border Stalin supported Chinas entry into the Korean War which drove the Americans back to the prewar boundaries but which escalated tensions The United States decided to mobilize its economy for a long contest with the Soviets built the hydrogen bomb and strengthened the NATO alliance that covered Western Europe According to Gorlizki and Khlevniuk Stalins consistent and overriding goal after 1945 was to consolidate the nations superpower status and in the face of his growing physical decrepitude to maintain his own hold on total power Stalin created a leadership system that reflected historic czarist styles of paternalism and repression yet was also quite modern At the top personal loyalty to Stalin counted for everything Stalin also created powerful committees elevated younger specialists and began major institutional innovations In the teeth of persecution Stalins deputies cultivated informal norms and mutual understandings which provided the foundations for collective rule after his death For most Westerners and anticommunist Russians Stalin is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians he is regarded as a great statesman and statebuilder China After the Chinese Civil War Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949 as the Nationalist government headed by the Kuomintang fled to the island of Taiwan In 19501953 China engaged in a largescale undeclared war with the United States South Korea and United Nations forces in the Korean War While the war ended in a military stalemate it gave Mao the opportunity to identify and purge elements in China that seemed supportive of capitalism At first there was close cooperation with Stalin who sent in technical experts to aid the industrialization process along the line of the Soviet model of the 1930s After Stalins death in 1953 relations with Moscow soured Mao thought Stalins successors had betrayed the Communist ideal Mao charged that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of a revisionist clique which had turned against Marxism and Leninism and was now setting the stage for the restoration of capitalism The two nations were at swords point by 1960 Both began forging alliances with communist supporters around the globe thereby splitting the worldwide movement into two hostile camps Rejecting the Soviet model of rapid urbanization Mao Zedong and his top aide Deng Xiaoping launched the Great Leap Forward in 19571961 with the goal of industrializing China overnight using the peasant villages as the base rather than large cities Private ownership of land ended and the peasants worked in large collective farms that were now ordered to start up heavy industry operations such as steel mills Plants were built in remote locations due to the lack of technical experts managers transportation or needed facilities Industrialization failed and the main result was a sharp unexpected decline in agricultural output which led to mass famine and millions of deaths The years of the Great Leap Forward in fact saw economic regression with 1958 through 1961 being the only years between 1953 and 1983 in which Chinas economy saw negative growth Political economist Dwight Perkins argues Enormous amounts of investment produced only modest increases in production or none at all In short the Great Leap was a very expensive disaster Put in charge of rescuing the economy Deng adopted pragmatic policies that the idealistic Mao disliked For a while Mao was in the shadows but returned to center stage and purged Deng and his allies in the Cultural Revolution 19661976 The Cultural Revolution was an upheaval that targeted intellectuals and party leaders from 1966 through 1976 Maos goal was to purify communism by removing procapitalists and traditionalists by imposing Maoist orthodoxy within the Chinese Communist Party The movement paralyzed China politically and weakened the country economically culturally and intellectually for years Millions of people were accused humiliated stripped of power and either imprisoned killed or most often sent to work as farm laborers Mao insisted that those he labelled revisionists be removed through violent class struggle The two most prominent militants were Marshall Lin Biao of the army and Maos wife Jiang Qing Chinas youth responded to Maos appeal by forming Red Guard groups around the country The movement spread into the military urban workers and the Communist party leadership itself It resulted in widespread factional struggles in all walks of life In the top leadership it led to a mass purge of senior officials who were accused of taking a capitalist road most notably Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping During the same period Maos personality cult grew to immense proportions After Maos death in 1976 the survivors were rehabilitated and many returned to power Maos government was responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation persecution prison labour and mass executions Mao has also been praised for transforming China from a semicolony to a leading world power with greatly advanced literacy womens rights basic healthcare primary education and life expectancy Cold War Its leading role in World War II saw the emergence of the industrialized Soviet Union as a superpower MarxistLeninist governments modeled on the Soviet Union took power with Soviet assistance in Bulgaria Czechoslovakia East Germany Poland Hungary and Romania A MarxistLeninist government was also created under Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia Titos independent policies led to the TitoStalin split and expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Cominform in 1948 and Titoism was branded deviationist Albania also became an independent MarxistLeninist state following the AlbanianSoviet split in 1960 resulting from an ideological fallout between Enver Hoxha a Stalinist and the Soviet government of Nikita Khrushchev who enacted a period of deStalinization and reapproached diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia in 1976 The Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong established the Peoples Republic of China which would follow its own ideological path of development following the SinoSoviet split Communism was seen as a rival of and a threat to Western capitalism for most of the 20th century In Western Europe communist parties were part of several postwar governments and even when the Cold War forced many of those countries to remove them from government such as in Italy they remained part of the liberaldemocratic process There were also many developments in libertarian Marxism especially during the 1960s with the New Left By the 1960s and 1970s many Western communist parties had criticized many of the actions of communist states distanced from them and developed a democratic road to socialism which became known as Eurocommunism This development was criticized by more orthodox supporters of the Soviet Union as amounting to social democracy Since 1957 communists have been frequently voted into power in the Indian state of Kerala In 1959 Cuban communist revolutionaries overthrew Cubas previous government under the dictator Fulgencio Batista The leader of the Cuban Revolution Fidel Castro ruled Cuba from 1959 until 2008 Dissolution of the Soviet Union With the fall of the Warsaw Pact after the Revolutions of 1989 which led to the fall of most of the former Eastern Bloc the Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991 It was a result of the declaration number 142 of the Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former Soviet republics and created the Commonwealth of Independent States although five of the signatories ratified it much later or did not do it at all On the previous day Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev the eighth and final leader of the Soviet Union resigned declared his office extinct and handed over its powers including control of the Cheget to Russian president Boris Yeltsin That evening at 732 the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and replaced with the prerevolutionary Russian flag Previously from August to December 1991 all the individual republics including Russia itself had seceded from the union The week before the unions formal dissolution eleven republics signed the AlmaAta Protocol formally establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States and declared that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist PostSoviet communism As of 2023 states controlled by Communist parties under a singleparty system include the Peoples Republic of China the Republic of Cuba the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Communist parties or their descendant parties remain politically important in several other countries With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Fall of Communism there was a split between those hardline Communists sometimes referred to in the media as neoStalinists who remained committed to orthodox MarxismLeninism and those such as The Left in Germany who work within the liberaldemocratic process for a democratic road to socialism other ruling Communist parties became closer to democratic socialist and socialdemocratic parties Outside Communist states reformed Communist parties have led or been part of leftleaning government or regional coalitions including in the former Eastern Bloc In Nepal Communists CPN UML and Nepal Communist Party were part of the 1st Nepalese Constituent Assembly which abolished the monarchy in 2008 and turned the country into a federal liberaldemocratic republic and have democratically shared power with other communists MarxistLeninists and Maoists CPN Maoist social democrats Nepali Congress and others as part of their Peoples Multiparty Democracy The Communist Party of the Russian Federation has some supporters but is reformist rather than revolutionary aiming to lessen the inequalities of Russias market economy Chinese economic reforms were started in 1978 under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and since then China has managed to bring down the poverty rate from 53 in the Mao era to just 8 in 2001 After losing Soviet subsidies and support Vietnam and Cuba have attracted more foreign investment to their countries with their economies becoming more marketoriented North Korea the last Communist country that still practices Sovietstyle Communism is both repressive and isolationist Theory Communist political thought and theory are diverse but share several core elements The dominant forms of communism are based on Marxism or Leninism but nonMarxist versions of communism also exist such as anarchocommunism and Christian communism which remain partly influenced by Marxist theories such as libertarian Marxism and humanist Marxism in particular Common elements include being theoretical rather than ideological identifying political parties not by ideology but by class and economic interest and identifying with the proletariat According to communists the proletariat can avoid mass unemployment only if capitalism is overthrown in the short run stateoriented communists favor state ownership of the commanding heights of the economy as a means to defend the proletariat from capitalist pressure Some communists are distinguished by other Marxists in seeing peasants and smallholders of property as possible allies in their goal of shortening the abolition of capitalism For Leninist communism such goals including shortterm proletarian interests to improve their political and material conditions can only be achieved through vanguardism an elitist form of socialism from above that relies on theoretical analysis to identify proletarian interests rather than consulting the proletarians themselves as is advocated by libertarian communists When they engage in elections Leninist communists main task is that of educating voters in what are deemed their true interests rather than in response to the expression of interest by voters themselves When they have gained control of the state Leninist communists main task was preventing other political parties from deceiving the proletariat such as by running their own independent candidates This vanguardist approach comes from their commitments to democratic centralism in which communists can only be cadres ie members of the party who are fulltime professional revolutionaries as was conceived by Vladimir Lenin Marxist communism Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that uses a materialist interpretation of historical development better known as historical materialism to understand social class relations and social conflict and a dialectical perspective to view social transformation It originates from the works of 19thcentury German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels As Marxism has developed over time into various branches and schools of thought no single definitive Marxist theory exists Marxism considers itself to be the embodiment of scientific socialism but does not model an ideal society based on the design of intellectuals whereby communism is seen as a state of affairs to be established based on any intelligent design rather it is a nonidealist attempt at the understanding of material history and society whereby communism is the expression of a real movement with parameters that are derived from actual life According to Marxist theory class conflict arises in capitalist societies due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed and exploited proletariat a class of wage laborers employed to produce goods and services and the bourgeoisie the ruling class that owns the means of production and extracts its wealth through appropriation of the surplus product produced by the proletariat in the form of profit This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a societys productive forces against its relations of production results in a period of shortterm crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying alienation of labor experienced by the proletariat albeit with varying degrees of class consciousness In periods of deep crisis the resistance of the oppressed can culminate in a proletarian revolution which if victorious leads to the establishment of the socialist mode of production based on social ownership of the means of production To each according to his contribution and production for use As the productive forces continued to advance the communist society ie a classless stateless humane society based on common ownership follows the maxim From each according to his ability to each according to his needs While it originates from the works of Marx and Engels Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory Different Marxian schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of classical Marxism while rejecting or modifying other aspects Many schools of thought have sought to combine Marxian concepts and nonMarxian concepts which has then led to contradictory conclusions There is a movement toward the recognition that historical materialism and dialectical materialism remain the fundamental aspects of all Marxist schools of thought MarxismLeninism and its offshoots are the most wellknown of these and have been a driving force in international relations during most of the 20th century Classical Marxism is the economic philosophical and sociological theories expounded by Marx and Engels as contrasted with later developments in Marxism especially Leninism and MarxismLeninism Orthodox Marxism is the body of Marxist thought that emerged after the death of Marx and which became the official philosophy of the socialist movement as represented in the Second International until World War I in 1914 Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of classical Marxism The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development advances in technology in the productive forces is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations eg feudalism capitalism and so on become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental societywide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new economic systems As a term orthodox Marxism represents the methods of historical materialism and of dialectical materialism and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marxs investigations Marxist concepts Class conflict and historical materialism At the root of Marxism is historical materialism the materialist conception of history which holds that the key characteristic of economic systems through history has been the mode of production and that the change between modes of production has been triggered by class struggle According to this analysis the Industrial Revolution ushered the world into the new capitalist mode of production Before capitalism certain working classes had ownership of instruments used in production however because machinery was much more efficient this property became worthless and the mass majority of workers could only survive by selling their labor to make use of someone elses machinery and making someone else profit Accordingly capitalism divided the world between two major classes namely that of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie These classes are directly antagonistic as the latter possesses private ownership of the means of production earning profit via the surplus value generated by the proletariat who have no ownership of the means of production and therefore no option but to sell its labor to the bourgeoisie According to the materialist conception of history it is through the furtherance of its own material interests that the rising bourgeoisie within feudalism captured power and abolished of all relations of private property only the feudal privilege thereby taking the feudal ruling class out of existence This was another key element behind the consolidation of capitalism as the new mode of production the final expression of class and property relations that has led to a massive expansion of production It is only in capitalism that private property in itself can be abolished Similarly the proletariat would capture political power abolish bourgeois property through the common ownership of the means of production therefore abolishing the bourgeoisie ultimately abolishing the proletariat itself and ushering the world into communism as a new mode of production In between capitalism and communism there is the dictatorship of the proletariat it is the defeat of the bourgeois state but not yet of the capitalist mode of production and at the same time the only element which places into the realm of possibility moving on from this mode of production This dictatorship based on the Paris Communes model is to be the most democratic state where the whole of the public authority is elected and recallable under the basis of universal suffrage Critique of political economy Critique of political economy is a form of social critique that rejects the various social categories and structures that constitute the mainstream discourse concerning the forms and modalities of resource allocation and income distribution in the economy Communists such as Marx and Engels are described as prominent critics of political economy The critique rejects economists use of what its advocates believe are unrealistic axioms faulty historical assumptions and the normative use of various descriptive narratives They reject what they describe as mainstream economists tendency to posit the economy as an a priori societal category Those who engage in critique of economy tend to reject the view that the economy and its categories is to be understood as something transhistorical It is seen as merely one of many types of historically specific ways to distribute resources They argue that it is a relatively new mode of resource distribution which emerged along with modernity Critics of economy critique the given status of the economy itself and do not aim to create theories regarding how to administer economies Critics of economy commonly view what is most commonly referred to as the economy as being bundles of metaphysical concepts as well as societal and normative practices rather than being the result of any selfevident or proclaimed economic laws They also tend to consider the views which are commonplace within the field of economics as faulty or simply as pseudoscience Into the 21st century there are multiple critiques of political economy what they have in common is the critique of what critics of political economy tend to view as dogma ie claims of the economy as a necessary and transhistorical societal category Marxian economics Marxian economics and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for falling rates of profit by cutting employees wages social benefits and pursuing military aggression The communist mode of production would succeed capitalism as humanitys new mode of production through workers revolution According to Marxian crisis theory communism is not an inevitability but an economic necessity Socialization versus nationalization An important concept in Marxism is socialization ie social ownership versus nationalization Nationalization is state ownership of property whereas socialization is control and management of property by society Marxism considers the latter as its goal and considers nationalization a tactical issue as state ownership is still in the realm of the capitalist mode of production In the words of Friedrich Engels the transformation into Stateownership does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces Stateownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution This has led Marxist groups and tendencies critical of the Soviet model to label states based on nationalization such as the Soviet Union as state capitalist a view that is also shared by several scholars Democracy in Marxism Leninist communism Leninism is a political ideology developed by Russian Marxist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin that proposes the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat led by a revolutionary vanguard party as the political prelude to the establishment of communism The function of the Leninist vanguard party is to provide the working classes with the political consciousness education and organisation and revolutionary leadership necessary to depose capitalism in the Russian Empire 17211917 Leninist revolutionary leadership is based upon The Communist Manifesto 1848 identifying the Communist party as the most advanced and resolute section of the working class parties of every country that section which pushes forward all others As the vanguard party the Bolsheviks viewed history through the theoretical framework of dialectical materialism which sanctioned political commitment to the successful overthrow of capitalism and then to instituting socialism and as the revolutionary national government to realize the socioeconomic transition by all means MarxismLeninism MarxismLeninism is a political ideology developed by Joseph Stalin According to its proponents it is based on Marxism and Leninism It describes the specific political ideology which Stalin implemented in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and in a global scale in the Comintern There is no definite agreement between historians about whether Stalin actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin It also contains aspects which according to some are deviations from Marxism such as socialism in one country MarxismLeninism was the official ideology of 20thcentury Communist parties including Trotskyist and was developed after the death of Lenin its three principles were dialectical materialism the leading role of the Communist party through democratic centralism and a planned economy with industrialization and agricultural collectivization MarxismLeninism is misleading because Marx and Lenin never sanctioned or supported the creation of an ism after them and is revealing because being popularized after Lenins death by Stalin it contained those three doctrinal and institutionalized principles that became a model for later Soviettype regimes its global influence having at its height covered at least onethird of the worlds population has made MarxistLeninist a convenient label for the Communist bloc as a dynamic ideological order During the Cold War MarxismLeninism was the ideology of the most clearly visible communist movement and is the most prominent ideology associated with communism Social fascism was a theory supported by the Comintern and affiliated Communist parties during the early 1930s which held that social democracy was a variant of fascism because it stood in the way of a dictatorship of the proletariat in addition to a shared corporatist economic model At the time leaders of the Comintern such as Stalin and Rajani Palme Dutt stated that capitalist society had entered the Third Period in which a proletariat revolution was imminent but could be prevented by social democrats and other fascist forces The term social fascist was used pejoratively to describe socialdemocratic parties antiComintern and progressive socialist parties and dissenters within Comintern affiliates throughout the interwar period The social fascism theory was advocated vociferously by the Communist Party of Germany which was largely controlled and funded by the Soviet leadership from 1928 Within MarxismLeninism antirevisionism is a position which emerged in the 1950s in opposition to the reforms and Khrushchev Thaw of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev Where Khrushchev pursued an interpretation that differed from Stalin the antirevisionists within the international communist movement remained dedicated to Stalins ideological legacy and criticized the Soviet Union under Khrushchev and his successors as state capitalist and social imperialist due to its hopes of achieving peace with the United States The term Stalinism is also used to describe these positions but is often not used by its supporters who opine that Stalin practiced orthodox Marxism and Leninism Because different political trends trace the historical roots of revisionism to different eras and leaders there is significant disagreement today as to what constitutes antirevisionism Modern groups which describe themselves as antirevisionist fall into several categories Some uphold the works of Stalin and Mao Zedong and some the works of Stalin while rejecting Mao and universally tend to oppose Trotskyism Others reject both Stalin and Mao tracing their ideological roots back to Marx and Lenin In addition other groups uphold various lesswellknown historical leaders such as Enver Hoxha who also broke with Mao during the SinoAlbanian split Social imperialism was a term used by Mao to criticize the Soviet Union postStalin Mao stated that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist faade Hoxha agreed with Mao in this analysis before later using the expression to also condemn Maos Three Worlds Theory Stalinism Stalinism represents Stalins style of governance as opposed to MarxismLeninism the socioeconomic system and political ideology implemented by Stalin in the Soviet Union and later adapted by other states based on the ideological Soviet model such as central planning nationalization and oneparty state along with public ownership of the means of production accelerated industrialization proactive development of societys productive forces research and development and nationalized natural resources MarxismLeninism remained after deStalinization whereas Stalinism did not In the last letters before his death Lenin warned against the danger of Stalins personality and urged the Soviet government to replace him Until the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 the Soviet Communist party referred to its own ideology as MarxismLeninismStalinism MarxismLeninism has been criticized by other communist and Marxist tendencies which state that MarxistLeninist states did not establish socialism but rather state capitalism According to Marxism the dictatorship of the proletariat represents the rule of the majority democracy rather than of one party to the extent that the cofounder of Marxism Friedrich Engels described its specific form as the democratic republic According to Engels state property by itself is private property of capitalist nature unless the proletariat has control of political power in which case it forms public property Whether the proletariat was actually in control of the MarxistLeninist states is a matter of debate between MarxismLeninism and other communist tendencies To these tendencies MarxismLeninism is neither Marxism nor Leninism nor the union of both but rather an artificial term created to justify Stalins ideological distortion forced into the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Comintern In the Soviet Union this struggle against MarxismLeninism was represented by Trotskyism which describes itself as a Marxist and Leninist tendency Trotskyism Trotskyism developed by Leon Trotsky in opposition to Stalinism is a Marxist and Leninist tendency that supports the theory of permanent revolution and world revolution rather than the twostage theory and Stalins socialism in one country It supported another communist revolution in the Soviet Union and proletarian internationalism Rather than representing the dictatorship of the proletariat Trotsky claimed that the Soviet Union had become a degenerated workers state under the leadership of Stalin in which class relations had reemerged in a new form Trotskys politics differed sharply from those of Stalin and Mao most importantly in declaring the need for an international proletarian revolution rather than socialism in one country and support for a true dictatorship of the proletariat based on democratic principles Struggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union Trotsky and his supporters organized into the Left Opposition the platform of which became known as Trotskyism In particular Trotsky advocated for a decentralised form of economic planning mass soviet democratization elected representation of Soviet socialist parties the tactic of a united front against farright parties cultural autonomy for artistic movements voluntary collectivisation a transitional program and socialist internationalism Trotsky had the support of many party intellectuals but this was overshadowed by the huge apparatus which included the GPU and the party cadres who were at the disposal of Stalin Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotskys exile from the Soviet Union in 1929 While in exile Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin founding in 1938 the Fourth International a Trotskyist rival to the Comintern In August 1940 Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on Stalins orders Trotskyist currents include orthodox Trotskyism third camp Posadism and Pabloism The economic platform of a planned economy combined with an authentic workers democracy as originally advocated by Trotsky has constituted the programme of the Fourth International and the modern Trotskyist movement Maoism Maoism is the theory derived from the teachings of the Chinese political leader Mao Zedong Developed from the 1950s until the Deng Xiaoping Chinese economic reform in the 1970s it was widely applied as the guiding political and military ideology of the Communist Party of China and as the theory guiding revolutionary movements around the world A key difference between Maoism and other forms of MarxismLeninism is that peasants should be the bulwark of the revolutionary energy which is led by the working class Three common Maoist values are revolutionary populism being practical and dialectics The synthesis of MarxismLeninismMaoism which builds upon the two individual theories as the Chinese adaption of MarxismLeninism did not occur during the life of Mao After deStalinization MarxismLeninism was kept in the Soviet Union while certain antirevisionist tendencies like Hoxhaism and Maoism stated that such had deviated from its original concept Different policies were applied in Albania and China which became more distanced from the Soviet Union From the 1960s groups who called themselves Maoists or those who upheld Maoism were not unified around a common understanding of Maoism instead having their own particular interpretations of the political philosophical economical and military works of Mao Its adherents claim that as a unified coherent higher stage of Marxism it was not consolidated until the 1980s first being formalized by the Shining Path in 1982 Through the experience of the peoples war waged by the party the Shining Path were able to posit Maoism as the newest development of Marxism Eurocommunism Eurocommunism was a revisionist trend in the 1970s and 1980s within various Western European communist parties claiming to develop a theory and practice of social transformation more relevant to their region Especially prominent within the French Communist Party Italian Communist Party and Communist Party of Spain Communists of this nature sought to undermine the influence of the Soviet Union and its AllUnion Communist Party Bolsheviks during the Cold War Eurocommunists tended to have a larger attachment to liberty and democracy than their MarxistLeninist counterparts Enrico Berlinguer general secretary of Italys major Communist party was widely considered the father of Eurocommunism Libertarian Marxist communism Libertarian Marxism is a broad range of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the antiauthoritarian aspects of Marxism Early currents of libertarian Marxism known as left communism emerged in opposition to MarxismLeninism and its derivatives such as Stalinism and Maoism as well as Trotskyism Libertarian Marxism is also critical of reformist positions such as those held by social democrats Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels later works specifically the Grundrisse and The Civil War in France emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to mediate or aid its liberation Along with anarchism libertarian Marxism is one of the main derivatives of libertarian socialism Aside from left communism libertarian Marxism includes such currents as autonomism communization council communism De Leonism the JohnsonForest Tendency Lettrism Luxemburgism Situationism Socialisme ou Barbarie Solidarity the World Socialist Movement and workerism as well as parts of FreudoMarxism and the New Left Moreover libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both postleft and social anarchists Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Antonie Pannekoek Raya Dunayevskaya Cornelius Castoriadis Maurice Brinton Daniel Gurin and Yanis Varoufakis the latter of whom claims that Marx himself was a libertarian Marxist Council communism Council communism is a movement that originated from Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s whose primary organization was the Communist Workers Party of Germany It continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both libertarian Marxism and libertarian socialism The core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by workers councils which are composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment Council communists oppose the perceived authoritarian and undemocratic nature of central planning and of state socialism labelled state capitalism and the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party would necessarily produce a party dictatorship Council communists support a workers democracy produced through a federation of workers councils In contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist communism the central argument of council communism is that democratic workers councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural forms of workingclass organizations and governmental power This view is opposed to both the reformist and the Leninist communist ideologies which respectively stress parliamentary and institutional government by applying social reforms on the one hand and vanguard parties and participative democratic centralism on the other Left communism Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left which criticizes the political ideas and practices espoused particularly following the series of revolutions that brought World War I to an end by Bolsheviks and social democrats Left communists assert positions which they regard as more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of MarxismLeninism espoused by the Communist International after its first congress March 1919 and during its second congress JulyAugust 1920 Left communists represent a range of political movements distinct from MarxistLeninists whom they largely view as merely the leftwing of capital from anarchocommunists some of whom they consider to be internationalist socialists and from various other revolutionary socialist tendencies such as De Leonists whom they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances Bordigism is a Leninist leftcommunist current named after Amadeo Bordiga who has been described as being more Leninist than Lenin and considered himself to be a Leninist Other types of communism Anarchocommunism Anarchocommunism is a libertarian theory of anarchism and communism which advocates the abolition of the state private property and capitalism in favor of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle From each according to his ability to each according to his need Anarchocommunism differs from Marxism in that it rejects its view about the need for a state socialism phase prior to establishing communism Peter Kropotkin the main theorist of anarchocommunism stated that a revolutionary society should transform itself immediately into a communist society that it should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the more advanced completed phase of communism In this way it tries to avoid the reappearance of class divisions and the need for a state to be in control Some forms of anarchocommunism such as insurrectionary anarchism are egoist and strongly influenced by radical individualism believing that anarchist communism does not require a communitarian nature at all Most anarchocommunists view anarchist communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society Christian communism Christian communism is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of Jesus Christ compel Christians to support religious communism as the ideal social system Although there is no universal agreement on the exact dates when communistic ideas and practices in Christianity began many Christian communists state that evidence from the Bible suggests that the first Christians including the Apostles in the New Testament established their own small communist society in the years following Jesus death and resurrection Many advocates of Christian communism state that it was taught by Jesus and practiced by the apostles themselves an argument that historians and others including anthropologist Roman A Montero scholars like Ernest Renan and theologians like Charles Ellicott and Donald Guthrie generally agree with Christian communism enjoys some support in Russia Russian musician Yegor Letov was an outspoken Christian communist and in a 1995 interview he was quoted as saying Communism is the Kingdom of God on Earth Analysis Reception Emily Morris from University College London wrote that because Karl Marxs writings have inspired many movements including the Russian Revolution of 1917 communism is commonly confused with the political and economic system that developed in the Soviet Union after the revolution Morris also wrote that Sovietstyle communism did not work due to an overcentralised oppressive bureaucratic and rigid economic and political system Historian Andrzej Paczkowski summarized communism as an ideology that seemed clearly the opposite that was based on the secular desire of humanity to achieve equality and social justice and that promised a great leap forward into freedom In contrast AustrianAmerican economist Ludwig von Mises argued that by abolishing free markets communist officials would not have the price system necessary to guide their planned production Anticommunism developed as soon as communism became a conscious political movement in the 19th century and anticommunist mass killings have been reported against alleged communists or their alleged supporters which were committed by anticommunists and political organizations or governments opposed to communism The communist movement has faced opposition since it was founded and the opposition to it has often been organized and violent Many of these anticommunist mass killing campaigns primarily during the Cold War were supported by the United States and its Western Bloc allies including those who were formally part of the NonAligned Movement such as the Indonesian mass killings of 196566 and Operation Condor in South America Excess mortality in Communist states Many authors have written about excess deaths under Communist states and mortality rates such as excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin Some authors posit that there is a Communist death toll whose death estimates vary widely depending on the definitions of the deaths that are included in them ranging from lows of 1020 million to highs over 100 million The higher estimates have been criticized by several scholars as ideologically motivated and inflated they are also criticized for being inaccurate due to incomplete data inflated by counting any excess death making an unwarranted link to communism and the grouping and bodycounting itself Higher estimates account for actions that Communist governments committed against civilians including executions humanmade famines and deaths that occurred during or resulted from imprisonment and forced deportations and labor Higher estimates are criticized for being based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable and for being skewed to higher possible values Others have argued that while certain estimates may not be accurate quibbling about numbers is unseemly What matters is that many many people were killed by communist regimes Historian Mark Bradley wrote that while the exact numbers have been in dispute the order of magnitude is not There is no consensus among genocide scholars and scholars of Communism about whether some or all the events constituted a genocide or mass killing Among genocide scholars there is no consensus on a common terminology and the events have been variously referred to as excess mortality or mass deaths other terms used to define some of such killings include classicide crimes against humanity democide genocide politicide holocaust mass killing and repression These scholars state that most Communist states did not engage in mass killings Benjamin Valentino proposes the category of Communist mass killing alongside colonial counterguerrilla and ethnic mass killing as a subtype of dispossessive mass killing to distinguish it from coercive mass killing Genocide scholars do not consider ideology or regimetype as an important factor that explains mass killings Some authors such as John Gray Daniel Goldhagen and Richard Pipes consider the ideology of communism to be a significant causative factor in mass killings Some connect killings in Joseph Stalins Soviet Union Mao Zedongs China and Pol Pots Cambodia on the basis that Stalin influenced Mao who influenced Pol Pot in all cases scholars say killings were carried out as part of a policy of an unbalanced modernization process of rapid industrialization Daniel Goldhagen argues that 20th century communist regimes have killed more people than any other regime type Some authors and politicians such as George G Watson allege that genocide was dictated in otherwise forgotten works of Karl Marx Many commentators on the political right point to the mass deaths under Communist states claiming them as an indictment of communism Opponents of this view argue that these killings were aberrations caused by specific authoritarian regimes and not caused by communism itself and point to mass deaths in wars and famines that they argue were caused by colonialism capitalism and anticommunism as a counterpoint to those killings According to Dovid Katz and other historians a historical revisionist view of the double genocide theory equating mass deaths under Communist states with the Holocaust is popular in Eastern European countries and the Baltic states and their approaches of history have been incorporated in the European Union agenda among them the Prague Declaration in June 2008 and the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism which was proclaimed by the European Parliament in August 2008 and endorsed by the OSCE in Europe in July 2009 Some scholars in Western Europe have rejected the comparison of the two regimes and the equation of their crimes Memory and legacy Criticism of communism can be divided into two broad categories namely that criticism of Communist party rule that concerns with the practical aspects of 20thcentury Communist states and criticism of Marxism and communism generally that concerns its principles and theory Public memory of 20thcentury Communist states has been described as a battleground between the communistsympathetic or antianticommunist political left and the anticommunism of the political right Critics of communism on the political right point to the excess deaths under Communist states as an indictment of communism as an ideology Defenders of communism on the political left say that the deaths were caused by specific authoritarian regimes and not communism as an ideology while also pointing to anticommunist mass killings and deaths in wars that they argue were caused by capitalism and anticommunism as a counterpoint to the deaths under Communist states According to Hungarian sociologist and politician Andrs Bozki positive aspects of communist countries included support for social mobility and equality the elimination of illiteracy urbanization more accessible healthcare and housing regional mobility with public transportation the elimination of semifeudal hierarchies more women entering the labor market and free access to higher education Negative aspects of communist countries on the other hand according to Bozki included the suppression of freedom the loss of trust in civil society a culture of fear and corruption reduced international travel dependency on the party and state Central Europe becoming a satellite of the Soviet Union the creation of closed societies leading to xenophobia racism prejudice cynicism and pessimism women only being emancipated in the workforce the oppression of national identity and relativist ethical societal standards Memory studies have been done on how the events are memorized According to Kristen R Ghodsee and Scott Sehon on the political left there are those with some sympathy for socialist ideals and the popular opinion of hundreds of millions of Russian and east European citizens nostalgic for their state socialist pasts while on the political right there are the committed antitotalitarians both east and west insisting that all experiments with Marxism will always and inevitably end with the gulag The victims of Communism concept has become accepted scholarship as part of the double genocide theory in Eastern Europe and among anticommunists in general it is rejected by some Western European and other scholars especially when it is used to equate Communism and Nazism which is seen by scholars as a longdiscredited perspective The narrative posits that famines and mass deaths by Communist states can be attributed to a single cause and that communism as the deadliest ideology in history or in the words of Jonathan Rauch as the deadliest fantasy in human history represents the greatest threat to humanity Proponents posit an alleged link between communism leftwing politics and socialism with genocide mass killing and totalitarianism Some authors as Stphane Courtois propose a theory of equivalence between class and racial genocide It is supported by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation with 100 million being the most common estimate used from The Black Book of Communism despite some of the authors of the book distancing themselves from the estimates made by Stephen Courtois Various museums and monuments have been constructed in remembrance of the victims of Communism with support of the European Union and various governments in Canada Eastern Europe and the United States Works such as The Black Book of Communism and Bloodlands legitimized debates on the comparison of Nazism and Stalinism and by extension communism and the former work in particular was important in the criminalization of communism According to Freedom House Communism is considered one of the two great totalitarian movements of the 20th century the other being Nazism but added that there is an important difference in how the world has treated these two execrable phenomena The failure of Communist governments to live up to the ideal of a communist society their general trend towards increasing authoritarianism their bureaucracy and the inherent inefficiencies in their economies have been linked to the decline of communism in the late 20th century Walter Scheidel stated that despite widereaching government actions Communist states failed to achieve longterm economic social and political success The experience of the dissolution of the Soviet Union the North Korean famine and alleged economic underperformance when compared to developed free market systems are cited as examples of Communist states failing to build a successful state while relying entirely on what they view as orthodox Marxism Despite those shortcomings Philipp Ther stated that there was a general increase in the standard of living throughout Eastern Bloc countries as the result of modernization programs under Communist governments Most experts agree there was a significant increase in mortality rates following the years 1989 and 1991 including a 2014 World Health Organization report which concluded that the health of people in the former Soviet countries deteriorated dramatically after the collapse of the Soviet Union PostCommunist Russia during the IMFbacked economic reforms of Boris Yeltsin experienced surging economic inequality and poverty as unemployment reached double digits by the early to mid 1990s By contrast the Central European states of the former Eastern BlocCzech Republic Hungary Poland and Slovakiashowed healthy increases in life expectancy from the 1990s onward compared to nearly thirty years of stagnation under Communism Bulgaria and Romania followed this trend after the introduction of more serious economic reforms in the late 1990s The economies of Eastern Bloc countries had previously experienced stagnation in the 1980s under Communism A common expression throughout Eastern Europe after 1989 was everything they told us about communism was a lie but everything they told us about capitalism was true 192 The rightlibertarian think tank Cato Institute has stated that the analyses done of postcommunist countries in the 1990s were premature and that early and rapid reformers by far outperformed gradual reformers on GDP per capita the United Nations Human Development Index and political freedom in addition to developing better institutions The institute also stated that the process of privatization in Russia was deeply flawed due to Russias reforms being far less rapid than those of Central Europe and the Baltic states The average postCommunist country had returned to 1989 levels of percapita GDP by 2005 However Branko Milanovi wrote in 2015 that following the end of the Cold War many of those countries economies declined to such an extent during the transition to capitalism that they have yet to return to the point they were prior to the collapse of communism Several scholars state that the negative economic developments in postCommunist countries after the fall of Communism led to increased nationalist sentiment and nostalgia for the Communist era In 2011 The Guardian published an analysis of the former Soviet countries twenty years after the fall of the USSR They found that GDP fell as much as 50 percent in the 1990s in some republics as capital flight industrial collapse hyperinflation and tax avoidance took their toll but that there was a rebound in the 2000s and by 2010 some economies were five times as big as they were in 1991 Life expectancy has grown since 1991 in some of the countries but fallen in others likewise some held free and fair elections while others remained authoritarian By 2019 the majority of people in most Eastern European countries approved of the shift to multiparty democracy and a market economy with approval being highest among residents of Poland and residents in the territory of what was once East Germany and disapproval being the highest among residents of Russia and Ukraine In addition 61 percent said that standards of living were now higher than they had been under Communism while only 31 percent said that they were worse with the remaining 8 percent saying that they did not know or that standards of living had not changed According to Grigore PopEleches and Joshua Tucker in their book Communisms Shadow Historical Legacies and Contemporary Political Attitudes citizens of postCommunist countries are less supportive of democracy and more supportive of governmentprovided social welfare They also found that those who lived under Communist rule were more likely to be leftauthoritarian referencing the rightwing authoritarian personality than citizens of other countries Those who are leftauthoritarian in this sense more often tend to be older generations that lived under Communism In contrast younger postCommunist generations continue to be antidemocratic but are not as leftwing ideologically which in the words of PopEleches and Tucker might help explain the growing popularity of rightwing populists in the region Conservatives liberals and social democrats generally view 20thcentury Communist states as unqualified failures Political theorist and professor Jodi Dean argues that this limits the scope of discussion around political alternatives to capitalism and neoliberalism Dean argues that when people think of capitalism they do not consider what are its worst results climate change economic inequality hyperinflation the Great Depression the Great Recession the robber barons and unemployment because the history of capitalism is viewed as dynamic and nuanced the history of communism is not considered dynamic or nuanced and there is a fixed historical narrative of communism that emphasizes authoritarianism the gulag starvation and violence Ghodsee along with the historians Gary Gerstle and Walter Scheidel suggest that the rise and fall of communism had a significant impact on the development and decline of labor movements and social welfare states in the United States and other Western societies Gerstle argues that organized labor in the United States was strongest when the threat of communism reached its peak and the decline of both organized labor and the welfare state coincided with the collapse of communism Both Gerstle and Scheidel posit that as economic elites in the West became more fearful of possible communist revolutions in their own societies especially as the tyranny and violence associated with communist governments became more apparent the more willing they were to compromise with the working class and much less so once the threat waned See also Works References Citations Explanatory footnotes Quotes Bibliography Further reading Adami Stefano Marrone G eds 2006 Communism Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies 1st ed

    title: "Feminism",
    originalContent:
      "Feminism is a range of sociopolitical movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political economic personal and social equality of the sexes Feminism holds the position that modern societies are patriarchalthey prioritize the male point of viewand that women are treated unjustly in these societies Efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes and improving educational professional and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women Originating in late 18thcentury Europe feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for womens rights including the right to vote run for public office work earn equal pay own property receive education enter into contracts have equal rights within marriage and maternity leave Feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception legal abortions and social integration and to protect women and girls from sexual assault sexual harassment and domestic violence Changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for women have also been part of feminist movements Many scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for womens rights particularly in the West where they are nearuniversally credited with achieving womens suffrage genderneutral language reproductive rights for women including access to contraceptives and abortion and the right to enter into contracts and own property Although feminist advocacy is and has been mainly focused on womens rights some argue for the inclusion of mens liberation within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles Feminist theory which emerged from feminist movements aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining womens social roles and lived experiences Feminist theorists have developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years representing different viewpoints and political aims Traditionally since the 19th century firstwave liberal feminism which sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework was contrasted with labourbased proletarian womens movements that over time developed into socialist and Marxist feminism based on class struggle theory Since the 1960s both of these traditions are also contrasted with the radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of secondwave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate patriarchy Liberal socialist and radical feminism are sometimes referred to as the Big Three schools of feminist thought Since the late 20th century many newer forms of feminism have emerged Some forms such as white feminism and gendercritical feminism have been criticized as taking into account only white middle class collegeeducated heterosexual or cisgender perspectives These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism such as black feminism and intersectional feminism Some have argued that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of womens interests above mens and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women History Terminology Mary Wollstonecraft is seen by many as a founder of feminism due to her 1792 book titled A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in which she argues that class and private property are the basis of discrimination against women and that women as much as men needed equal rights Charles Fourier a utopian socialist and French philosopher is credited with having coined the word fminisme in 1837 but no trace of the word have been found in his works The word fminisme feminism first appeared in France in 1871 in a medicine thesis about men suffering from tuberculosis and having developed according to the author FerdinandValre Faneau de la Cour feminine traits The word fministe feminist inspired by its medical use was coined by Alexandre Dumas fils in a 1872 essay referring to men who supported women rights In both cases the use of the word was very negative and reflected a criticism of a socalled confusion of the sexes by women who refused to abide by the sexual division of society and challenged the inequalities between sexes The concepts appeared in the Netherlands in 1872 Great Britain in the 1890s and the United States in 1910 The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first appearance in English in this meaning back to 1895 Depending on the historical moment culture and country feminists around the world have had different causes and goals Most western feminist historians contend that all movements working to obtain womens rights should be considered feminist movements even when they did not or do not apply the term to themselves Other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants Those historians use the label protofeminist to describe earlier movements Waves The history of the modern western feminist movement is divided into multiple waves The first comprised womens suffrage movements of the 19th and early20th centuries promoting womens right to vote The second wave the womens liberation movement began in the 1960s and campaigned for legal and social equality for women In or around 1992 a third wave was identified characterized by a focus on individuality and diversity Additionally some have argued for the existence of a fourth wave starting around 2012 which has used social media to combat sexual harassment violence against women and rape culture it is best known for the Me Too movement 19th and early 20th centuries Firstwave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th and early20th centuries In the UK and US it focused on the promotion of equal contract marriage parenting and property rights for women New legislation included the Custody of Infants Act 1839 in the UK which introduced the tender years doctrine for child custody and gave women the right of custody of their children for the first time Other legislation such as the Married Womens Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act became models for similar legislation in other British territories Victoria passed legislation in 1884 and New South Wales in 1889 the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897 With the turn of the 19th century activism focused primarily on gaining political power particularly the right of womens suffrage though some feminists were active in campaigning for womens sexual reproductive and economic rights too Womens suffrage the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office began in Britains Australasian colonies at the end of the 19th century with the selfgoverning colony of New Zealand granting women the right to vote in 1893 South Australia followed suit with the Constitutional Amendment Adult Suffrage Act 1894 in 1894 This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902 In Britain the suffragettes and suffragists campaigned for the womens vote and in 1918 the Representation of the People Act was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property In 1928 this was extended to all women over 21 Emmeline Pankhurst was the most notable activist in England Time named her one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century stating she shaped an idea of women for our time she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back In the US notable leaders of this movement included Lucretia Mott Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery before championing womens right to vote These women were influenced by the Quaker theology of spiritual equality which asserts that men and women are equal under God In the US firstwave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution 1919 granting women the right to vote in all states The term first wave was coined retroactively when the term secondwave feminism came into use In Germany feminists like Clara Zetkin was very interested in womens politics including the fight for equal opportunities and womens suffrage through socialism She helped to develop the socialdemocratic womens movement in Germany From 1891 to 1917 she edited the SPD womens newspaper Die Gleichheit Equality In 1907 she became the leader of the newly founded Womens Office at the SPD She also contributed to International Womens Day IWD During the late Qing period and reform movements such as the Hundred Days Reform Chinese feminists called for womens liberation from traditional roles and NeoConfucian gender segregation Later the Chinese Communist Party created projects aimed at integrating women into the workforce and claimed that the revolution had successfully achieved womens liberation According to Nawar alHassan Golley Arab feminism was closely connected with Arab nationalism In 1899 Qasim Amin considered the father of Arab feminism wrote The Liberation of Women which argued for legal and social reforms for women He drew links between womens position in Egyptian society and nationalism leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement In 1923 Hoda Shaarawi founded the Egyptian Feminist Union became its president and a symbol of the Arab womens rights movement The Iranian Constitutional Revolution in 1905 triggered the Iranian womens movement which aimed to achieve womens equality in education marriage careers and legal rights However during the Iranian revolution of 1979 many of the rights that women had gained from the womens movement were systematically abolished such as the Family Protection Law Mid20th century By the mid20th century women still lacked significant rights In France women obtained the right to vote only with the Provisional Government of the French Republic of 21 April 1944 The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by Fernard Grenier they were given full citizenship including the right to vote Greniers proposition was adopted 51 to 16 In May 1947 following the November 1946 elections the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the gender gap stating in Le Populaire that women had not voted in a consistent way dividing themselves as men according to social classes During the baby boom period feminism waned in importance Wars both World War I and World War II had seen the provisional emancipation of some women but postwar periods signalled the return to conservative roles In Switzerland women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971 but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991 when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland In Liechtenstein women were given the right to vote by the womens suffrage referendum of 1984 Three prior referendums held in 1968 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure womens right to vote Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of family laws which gave husbands control over their wives Although by the 20th century coverture had been abolished in the UK and US in many continental European countries married women still had very few rights For instance in France married women did not receive the right to work without their husbands permission until 1965 Feminists have also worked to abolish the marital exemption in rape laws which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives Earlier efforts by firstwave feminists such as Voltairine de Cleyre Victoria Woodhull and Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir provided a Marxist solution and an existentialist view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of Le Deuxime Sexe The Second Sex in 1949 The book expressed feminists sense of injustice Secondwave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present as such it coexists with thirdwave feminism Secondwave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage such as ending gender discrimination Secondwave feminists see womens cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures The feminist activist and author Carol Hanisch coined the slogan The Personal is Political which became synonymous with the second wave Second and thirdwave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of womens roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements and new discussions about whether womens equality has actually been fully achieved In 1956 President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt initiated state feminism which outlawed discrimination based on gender and granted womens suffrage but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders During Sadats presidency his wife Jehan Sadat publicly advocated further womens rights though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from womens equality with the new Islamist movement and growing conservatism However some activists proposed a new feminist movement Islamic feminism which argues for womens equality within an Islamic framework In Latin America revolutions brought changes in womens status in countries such as Nicaragua where feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution aided womens quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change In 1963 Betty Friedans book The Feminine Mystique helped voice the discontent that American women felt The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of secondwave feminism in the United States Within ten years women made up over half the First World workforce In 1970 Australian writer Germaine Greer published The Female Eunuch which became a worldwide bestseller reportedly driving up divorce rates Greer posits that men hate women that women do not know this and direct the hatred upon themselves as well as arguing that women are devitalised and repressed in their role as housewives and mothers Late 20th and early 21st centuries Thirdwave feminism Thirdwave feminism is traced to the emergence of the riot grrrl feminist punk subculture in Olympia Washington in the early 1990s and to Anita Hills televised testimony in 1991to an allmale allwhite Senate Judiciary Committeethat Clarence Thomas nominated for the Supreme Court of the United States had sexually harassed her The term third wave is credited to Rebecca Walker who responded to Thomass appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in Ms magazine Becoming the Third Wave 1992 She wrote So I write this as a plea to all women especially women of my generation Let Thomas confirmation serve to remind you as it did me that the fight is far from over Let this dismissal of a womans experience move you to anger Turn that outrage into political power Do not vote for them unless they work for us Do not have sex with them do not break bread with them do not nurture them if they dont prioritize our freedom to control our bodies and our lives I am not a postfeminism feminist I am the Third Wave Thirdwave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second waves essentialist definitions of femininity which thirdwave feminists argued overemphasized the experiences of upper middleclass white women Thirdwave feminists often focused on micropolitics and challenged the second waves paradigm as to what was or was not good for women and tended to use a poststructuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave such as Gloria Anzalda bell hooks Chela Sandoval Cherre Moraga Audre Lorde Maxine Hong Kingston and many other nonwhite feminists sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of racerelated subjectivities Thirdwave feminism also contained internal debates between difference feminists who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to social conditioning Standpoint theory Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view stating that a persons social position influences their knowledge This perspective argues that research and theory treat women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased Since the 1980s standpoint feminists have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues such as rape incest and prostitution and culturally specific issues such as female genital mutilation in some parts of Africa and Arab societies as well as glass ceiling practices that impede womens advancement in developed economies in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism homophobia classism and colonization in a matrix of domination Fourthwave feminism Fourthwave feminism is a proposed extension of thirdwave feminism which corresponds to a resurgence in interest in feminism beginning around 2012 and associated with the use of social media According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to sexual harassment and violence against women Its essence she writes is incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist Fourthwave feminism is defined by technology according to Kira Cochrane and is characterized particularly by the use of Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Tumblr and blogs such as Feministing to challenge misogyny and further gender equality Issues that fourthwave feminists focus on include street and workplace harassment campus sexual assault and rape culture Scandals involving the harassment abuse and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement These have included the 2012 Delhi gang rape 2012 Jimmy Savile allegations the Bill Cosby allegations 2014 Isla Vista killings 2016 trial of Jian Ghomeshi 2017 Harvey Weinstein allegations and subsequent Weinstein effect and the 2017 Westminster sexual scandals Examples of fourthwave feminist campaigns include the Everyday Sexism Project No More Page 3 Stop Bild Sexism Mattress Performance 10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman YesAllWomen Free the Nipple One Billion Rising the 2017 Womens March the 2018 Womens March and the MeToo movement In December 2017 Time magazine chose several prominent female activists involved in the MeToo movement dubbed the silence breakers as Person of the Year Decolonial feminism Decolonial feminism reformulates the coloniality of gender by critiquing the very formation of gender and its subsequent formations of patriarchy and the gender binary not as universal constants across cultures but as structures that have been instituted by and for the benefit of European colonialism Mara Lugones proposes that decolonial feminism speaks to how the colonial imposition of gender cuts across questions of ecology economics government relations with the spirit world and knowledge as well as across everyday practices that either habituate us to take care of the world or to destroy it Decolonial feminists like Karla Jessen Williamson and Rauna Kuokkanen have examined colonialism as a force that has imposed gender hierarchies on Indigenous women that have disempowered and fractured Indigenous communities and ways of life Postfeminism The term postfeminism is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s While not being antifeminist postfeminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third and fourthwave feminist goals The term was first used to describe a backlash against secondwave feminism but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second waves ideas Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to todays society Amelia Jones has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed secondwave feminism as a monolithic entity Dorothy Chunn describes a blaming narrative under the postfeminist moniker where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for gender equality in a postfeminist society where gender equality has already been achieved According to Chunn many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them Theory Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines including anthropology sociology economics womens studies literary criticism art history psychoanalysis and philosophy Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics power relations and sexuality While providing a critique of these social and political relations much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of womens rights and interests Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination stereotyping objectification especially sexual objectification oppression and patriarchy In the field of literary criticism Elaine Showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases The first she calls feminist critique in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena The second Showalter calls gynocriticism in which the woman is producer of textual meaning The last phase she calls gender theory in which the ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sexgender system are explored This was paralleled in the 1970s by French feminists who developed the concept of criture fminine which translates as female or feminine writing Hlne Cixous argues that writing and philosophy are phallocentric and along with other French feminists such as Luce Irigaray emphasize writing from the body as a subversive exercise The work of Julia Kristeva a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher and Bracha Ettinger artist and psychoanalyst has influenced feminist theory in general and feminist literary criticism in particular However as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the Anglophone world Movements and ideologies Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years Feminism is often divided into three main traditions called liberal radical and socialistMarxist feminism sometimes known as the Big Three schools of feminist thought Since the late 20th century newer forms of feminisms have also emerged Some branches of feminism track the political leanings of the larger society to a greater or lesser degree or focus on specific topics such as the environment Liberal feminism Liberal feminism also known under other names such as reformist mainstream or historically as bourgeois feminism arose from 19thcentury firstwave feminism and was historically linked to 19thcentury liberalism and progressivism while 19thcentury conservatives tended to oppose feminism as such Liberal feminism seeks equality of men and women through political and legal reform within a liberal democratic framework without radically altering the structure of society liberal feminism works within the structure of mainstream society to integrate women into that structure During the 19th and early 20th centuries liberal feminism focused especially on womens suffrage and access to education Former Norwegian supreme court justice and former president of the liberal Norwegian Association for Womens Rights Karin Maria Bruzelius has described liberal feminism as a realistic sober practical feminism Susan Wendell argues that liberal feminism is an historical tradition that grew out of liberalism as can be seen very clearly in the work of such feminists as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill but feminists who took principles from that tradition have developed analyses and goals that go far beyond those of 18th and 19th century liberal feminists and many feminists who have goals and strategies identified as liberal feminist reject major components of liberalism in a modern or partypolitical sense she highlights equality of opportunity as a defining feature of liberal feminism Liberal feminism is a very broad term that encompasses many often diverging modern branches and a variety of feminist and general political perspectives some historically liberal branches are equality feminism social feminism equity feminism difference feminism individualistlibertarian feminism and some forms of state feminism particularly the state feminism of the Nordic countries The broad field of liberal feminism is sometimes confused with the more recent and smaller branch known as libertarian feminism which tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism For example libertarian feminism does not require social measures to reduce material inequality in fact it opposes such measures in contrast liberal feminism may support such requirements and egalitarian versions of feminism insist on them Catherine Rottenberg notes that the raison dtre of classic liberal feminism was to pose an immanent critique of liberalism revealing the gendered exclusions within liberal democracys proclamation of universal equality particularly with respect to the law institutional access and the full incorporation of women into the public sphere Rottenberg contrasts classic liberal feminism with modern neoliberal feminism which seems perfectly in sync with the evolving neoliberal order According to Zhang and Rios liberal feminism tends to be adopted by mainstream ie middleclass women who do not disagree with the current social structure They found that liberal feminism with its focus on equality is viewed as the dominant and default form of feminism Some modern forms of feminism that historically grew out of the broader liberal tradition have more recently also been described as conservative in relative terms This is particularly the case for libertarian feminism which conceives of people as selfowners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference Radical feminism Radical feminism arose from the radical wing of secondwave feminism and calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy It considers the malecontrolled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of womens oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships Lesbian feminism is thus closely related Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist Materialist ideologies Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different but overlapping movements all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideologys relationship to women Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of womens oppression and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that womens liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of womens oppression Anarchafeminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy which comes from involuntary hierarchy Other modern feminisms Ecofeminism Ecofeminists see mens control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment Ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature Black and postcolonial ideologies Sara Ahmed argues that Black and postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought During much of its history feminist movements and theoretical developments were led predominantly by middleclass white women from Western Europe and North America However women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the end of Western European colonialism in Africa the Caribbean parts of Latin America and Southeast Asia Since that time women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms Womanism emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middleclass Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless Thirdworld feminism and indigenous feminism are closely related to postcolonial feminism These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism motherism Stiwanism negofeminism femalism transnational feminism and Africana womanism Social constructionist ideologies In the late 20th century various feminists began to argue that gender roles are socially constructed and that it is impossible to generalize womens experiences across cultures and histories Poststructural feminism draws on the philosophies of poststructuralism and deconstruction in order to argue that the concept of gender is created socially and culturally through discourse Postmodern feminists also emphasize the social construction of gender and the discursive nature of reality however as Pamela Abbott et al write a postmodern approach to feminism highlights the existence of multiple truths rather than simply men and womens standpoints Transgender people Thirdwave feminists tend to view the struggle for trans rights as an integral part of intersectional feminism Fourthwave feminists also tend to be transinclusive The American National Organization for Women NOW president Terry ONeill said the struggle against transphobia is a feminist issue and NOW has affirmed that trans women are women trans girls are girls Several studies have found that people who identify as feminists tend to be more accepting of trans people than those who do not An ideology variously known as transexclusionary radical feminism or its acronym TERF or gendercritical feminism is critical of concepts of gender identity and transgender rights holding that biological sex characteristics are an immutable determination of gender or supersede the importance of gender identity that trans women are not women and that trans men are not men These views have been described as transphobic by many other feminists Cultural movements Riot grrrls took an anticorporate stance of selfsufficiency and selfreliance Riot grrrls emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with secondwave feminism than with the third wave The movement encouraged and made adolescent girls standpoints central allowing them to express themselves fully Lipstick feminism is a cultural feminist movement that attempts to respond to the backlash of secondwave radical feminism of the 1960s and 1970s by reclaiming symbols of feminine identity such as makeup suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure as valid and empowering personal choices Demographics According to 2014 Ipsos poll covering 15 developed countries 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists and 87 percent agreed that women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency not their gender However only 55 percent of women agreed that they have full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations Taken together these studies reflect the importance differentiating between claiming a feminist identity and holding feminist attitudes or beliefs According to a 2015 poll 18 percent of Americans use the label of feminist to describe themselves while 85 percent are feminists in practice as they reported they believe in equality for women The poll found that 52 percent did not identify as feminist 26 percent were unsure and 4 percent provided no response Sociological research shows that in the US increased educational attainment is associated with greater support for feminist issues In addition politically liberal people are more likely to support feminist ideals compared to those who are conservative According to a 2016 Survation poll for the Fawcett Society 7 percent of Britons use the label of feminist to describe themselves while 83 percent say they support equality of opportunity for women this included higher support from men 86 than women 81 Sexuality Feminist views on sexuality vary and have differed by historical period and by cultural context Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions Matters such as the sex industry sexual representation in the media and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s in what came to be known as the feminist sex wars which pitted antipornography feminism against sexpositive feminism and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s Over the course of the 1970s a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism Sex industry Opinions on the sex industry are diverse Feminists who are critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment Alternately feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and reflect a womans right to control and define her own sexuality Individualist feminists support the existence of a sex industry on the grounds that adult women have the right to consent to sexual acts as they choose and should have access to labor rights to earn money how they choose In this view banning the sex industry effectively strips women of their right to work and earn money on their own terms treating them as children who cannot make decisions for themselves In this view women who consider the sex industry degrading do not have to partake in it Women who do choose to work in the sex industry however should not be banned from doing so given that they are doing so willingly Libertarian Feminist Zine Reclaim has argued that sex work has helped more women including students freelancers and women in poverty achieve financial independence than all government grants combined Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of violence against women to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression and a legitimate career Similarly feminists views on prostitution vary ranging from critical to supportive Affirming female sexual autonomy For feminists a womans right to control her own sexuality is a key issue and one that is heavily contested between different branches of feminism Radical feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon argue that women have very little control over their own bodies with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies Radical feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances Some radical feminists have argued that women should not engage in heterosexual sex and choose lesbianism as a lifestyle and political choice a view that has fallen out of favor as sexuality is seen as largely biologically influenced rather than a choice one can make for political reasons Some radical feminists argue that all cultures are in one way or another dominated by ideologies that deny womens right to sexual expression because men under a patriarchy define sex on their own terms This entitlement can take different forms depending on the culture In some conservative and religious cultures marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times virtually without limit thus forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour In 1968 radical feminist Anne Koedt argued in her essay The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm that womens biology and the clitoral orgasm had not been properly analyzed and popularized because men have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina and not the clitoral area Other branches of feminism such as individualist feminism consider themselves sexpositive and see womens expression of their own sexuality as a right In this view what is or is not degrading is subjective and each person has a right to decide for themselves what sexual acts they find degrading and if they want to participate in them or not Individualist feminist Wendy McElroy wrote in her book XXX A Womans Right to Pornography lets examine the idea that pornography is degrading to women Degrading is a subjective term Personally I find detergent commercials in which women become orgasmic over soapsuds to be tremendously degrading to women I find movies in which prostitutes are treated like ignorant drug addicts to be slander against women Every woman has the rightthe needto define degradation for herself According to this view part of sexual autonomy is the right to define ones boundaries desires and limits around their sexuality rather than accept a narrative in which all women are victims of men during a sex act Science Sandra Harding says that the moral and political insights of the womens movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds Some feminists such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions Physicist Lisa Randall appointed to a task force at Harvard by thenpresident Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering said I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues dont have to come up anymore Lynn Hankinson Nelson writes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women Thus they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women and to uncover the consequences of omitting misdescribing or devaluing them to account for a range of human experience Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions Furthermore despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings Susan Haack also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about womens thinking as intuitive and emotional etc Meera Nanda further cautions that this may in fact trap women within traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy Biology and gender Modern feminism challenges the essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic For example Anne FaustoSterlings book Myths of Gender explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender In Delusions of Gender Cordelia Fine disputes scientific evidence that suggests that there is an innate biological difference between mens and womens minds asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences Feminist psychology Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects As women earned doctorates in psychology women and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study Feminist psychology emphasizes social context lived experience and qualitative analysis Projects such as Psychologys Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline Culture Design There is a long history of feminist activity in design disciplines like industrial design graphic design and fashion design This work has explored topics like beauty DIY feminine approaches to design and communitybased projects Some iconic writing includes Cheryl Buckleys essays on design and patriarchy and Joan Rothschilds Design and Feminism ReVisioning Spaces Places and Everyday Things More recently Isabel Prochners research explored how feminist perspectives can support positive change in industrial design helping to identify systemic social problems and inequities in design and guiding socially sustainable and grassroots design solutions Businesses Feminist activists have established a range of feminist businesses including feminist bookstores credit unions presses mailorder catalogs and restaurants These businesses flourished as part of the second and third waves of feminism in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s Visual arts Corresponding with general developments within feminism and often including such selforganizing tactics as the consciousnessraising group the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s Jeremy Strick director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles described the feminist art movement as the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period and Peggy Phelan says that it brought about the most farreaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades Feminist artist Judy Chicago who created The Dinner Party a set of vulvathemed ceramic plates in the 1970s said in 2009 to ARTnews There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative We are trying to change the future to get girls and boys to realize that womens art is not an exceptionits a normal part of art history A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn giving voice to the ways contemporary female artists are dealing with gender social media and the notion of embodiment Literature The feminist movement produced feminist fiction feminist nonfiction and feminist poetry which created new interest in womens writing It also prompted a general reevaluation of womens historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that womens lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest There has also been a close link between feminist literature and activism with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women In Western feminist literary scholarship Studies like Dale Spenders Mothers of the Novel 1986 and Jane Spencers The Rise of the Woman Novelist 1986 were groundbreaking in their insistence that women have always been writing Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest various presses began the task of reissuing longoutofprint texts Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th and early20thcentury novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation In the 1980s Pandora Press responsible for publishing Spenders study issued a companion line of 18thcentury novels written by women More recently Broadview Press continues to issue 18th and 19thcentury novels many hitherto out of print and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early womens novels Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts A Vindication of the Rights of Woman 1792 by Mary Wollstonecraft is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy A Room of Ones Own 1929 by Virginia Woolf is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy The widespread interest in womens writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the literary canon Interest in postcolonial literatures gay and lesbian literature writing by people of colour working peoples writing and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered literature and genres hitherto not regarded as literary such as childrens writing journals letters travel writing and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest Most genres and subgenres have undergone a similar analysis so literary studies have entered new territories such as the female gothic or womens science fiction According to Elyce Rae Helford Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought particularly as bridges between theory and practice Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender Notable texts of this kind are Ursula K Le Guins The Left Hand of Darkness 1969 Joanna Russ The Female Man 1970 Octavia Butlers Kindred 1979 and Margaret Atwoods Handmaids Tale 1985 Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about womens lived experiences For example Maya Angelous I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was extremely influential as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States In addition many feminist movements have embraced poetry as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies poetry collections and public readings Moreover historical pieces of writing by women have been used by feminists to speak about what womens lives were like in the past while demonstrating the power that they held and the impact they had in their communities An important figure in the history of womens literature is Hrotsvitha c 935973 a canoness who was an early female poet in the German lands As a historian Hrotsvitha is one of the few writers to address womens lives from a womans perspective during the Middle Ages Hrotsvithas six short dramas are considered to be her magnum opus She has been called the most remarkable woman of her time and an important figure in the history of women Music Womens music or womyns music or wimmins music is the music by women for women and about women The genre emerged as a musical expression of the secondwave feminist movement as well as the labour civil rights and peace movements The movement was started by lesbians such as Cris Williamson Meg Christian and Margie Adam AfricanAmerican women activists such as Bernice Johnson Reagon and her group Sweet Honey in the Rock and peace activist Holly Near Womens music also refers to the wider industry of womens music that goes beyond the performing artists to include studio musicians producers sound engineers technicians cover artists distributors promoters and festival organizers who are also women Riot grrrl is an underground feminist hardcore punk movement described in the cultural movements section of this article Feminism became a principal concern of musicologists in the 1980s as part of the New Musicology Prior to this in the 1970s musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers and had begun to review concepts of canon genius genre and periodization from a feminist perspective In other words the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked Through the 1980s and 1990s this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work Concepts such as music as gendered discourse professionalism reception of womens music examination of the sites of music production relative wealth and education of women popular music studies in relation to womens identity patriarchal ideas in music analysis and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time While the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles women are much less likely to have positions of authority such as being the leader of an orchestra In popular music while there are many women singers recording songs there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers the individuals who direct and manage the recording process Cinema Feminist cinema advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives arose largely with the development of feminist film theory in the late 1960s and early 1970s Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousnessraising groups and set about analysing from different perspectives dominant cinemas construction of women Differences were particularly marked between feminists on either side of the Atlantic 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the US and UK as well as the first feminist film journal Women Film Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey who also organized the Womens Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism feminist independent film and feminist distribution It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking Deconstruction concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema The second approach a feminist counterculture embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language Bracha L Ettinger invented a field of notions and concepts that serve the research of cinema from feminine perspective The Matrixial Gaze Ettingers language include original concepts to discover feminine perspectives Many writers in the fields of film theory and contemporary art are using the Ettingerian matrixial sphere matricial sphere During the 1930s1950s heyday of the big Hollywood studios the status of women in the industry was abysmal Since then female directors such as Sally Potter Catherine Breillat Claire Denis and Jane Campion have made art movies and directors like Kathryn Bigelow and Patty Jenkins have had mainstream success This progress stagnated in the 1990s and men outnumber women five to one in behind the camera roles Politics Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the 20th century Socialism Since the late 19th century some feminists have allied with socialism whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about womens rights August Bebel an early activist of the German Social Democratic Party SPD published his work Die Frau und der Sozialismus juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general In 1907 there was an International Conference of Socialist Women in Stuttgart where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle Clara Zetkin of the SPD called for womens suffrage to build a socialist order the only one that allows for a radical solution to the womens question In Britain the womens movement was allied with the Labour party In the US Betty Friedan emerged from a radical background to take leadership Radical Women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the US and is still active During the Spanish Civil War Dolores Ibrruri La Pasionaria led the Communist Party of Spain Although she supported equal rights for women she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the anarchafeminist Mujeres Libres Feminists in Ireland in the early 20th century included the revolutionary Irish Republican suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz who in 1918 was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons However in line with Sinn Fin abstentionist policy she would not take her seat in the House of Commons She was reelected to the Second Dil in the elections of 1921 She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army which was led by the socialist and selfdescribed feminist Irish leader James Connolly during the 1916 Easter Rising Fascism Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by womens groups Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the Fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above including women accomplished only in 1946 after the defeat of fascism and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25 This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist womens auxiliary groups such as the fasci femminilli and only partly realized in 1925 under pressure from dictator Benito Mussolinis more conservative coalition partners Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of Adolf Hitler feminism has a complicated relationship with the Nazi movement as well While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women they claimed to recognize womens equality in employment However Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism and after the rise of Nazism in Germany in 1933 there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the prewar period and to some extent during the 1920s Georges Duby et al write that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility with women maintaining a largely subordinate position Blamires also writes that neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept their traditional roles Civil rights movement and antiracism The civil rights movement has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa Many American feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between womens rights and the rights of nonwhite people Despite the connections between the womens and civil rights movements some tensions arose during the late 1960s and the 1970s as nonwhite women argued that feminism was predominantly white straight and middle class and did not understand and was not concerned with issues of race and sexuality Similarly some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist and homophobic elements and did not adequately address minority womens concerns These criticisms created new feminist social theories about identity politics and the intersections of racism classism and sexism they also generated new feminisms such as black feminism and Chicana feminism in addition to making large contributions to lesbian feminism and other integrations of queer of colour identity Neoliberalism Neoliberalism has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe especially in the global south Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking 177 Womens experiences in nonindustrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone 175 Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing womens participation in the workforce there will be heightened economic progress but feminist critics have stated that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations 18698 Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour the structural privileging of men and masculinity and the politicization of womens subordination in the family and the workplace 176 The feminization of employment refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable meaningful safe and secure 179 Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding docile and willing to accept low wages 180 Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this for instance employers often perpetuate ideas about women as secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion 189 Societal impact The feminist movement has effected change in Western society including womens suffrage greater access to education more equal payment to men the right to initiate divorce proceedings the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy including access to contraceptives and abortion and the right to own property Civil rights From the 1960s on the campaign for womens rights was met with mixed results in the US and the UK Other countries of the EEC agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to child sexual abuse The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of mens responsibility for their own conduct the men being adults In the US the National Organization for Women NOW began in 1966 to seek womens equality including through the Equal Rights Amendment ERA which did not pass although some states enacted their own Reproductive rights in the US centred on the court decision in Roe v Wade enunciating a womans right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term The division of labour within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild found that in twocareer couples men and women on average spend about equal amounts of time working but women still spend more time on housework although Cathy Young responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting Judith K Brown writes Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics the participant is not obliged to be far from home the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration and the work is not dangerous can be performed in spite of interruptions and is easily resumed once interrupted In international law the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW is an international convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and described as an international bill of rights for women It came into force in those nations ratifying it Jurisprudence Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of jurisprudence that examines the relationship between women and law It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars who typically see the law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a societys universal genderneutral ideals Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge womens values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience Language Proponents of genderneutral language argue that the use of genderspecific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society According to The Handbook of English Linguistics generic masculine pronouns and genderspecific job titles are instances where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species MerriamWebster chose feminism as its 2017 Word of the Year noting that Word of the Year is a quantitative measure of interest in a particular word Theology Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions practices scriptures and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities reinterpreting maledominated imagery and language about God determining womens place in relation to career and motherhood and studying images of women in the religions sacred texts Christian feminism is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the equality of women and men and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men and the overall treatment of women in the church Islamic feminists advocate womens rights gender equality and social justice grounded within an Islamic framework Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran hadith sayings of Muhammad and sharia law towards the creation of a more equal and just society Although rooted in Islam the movements pioneers have also used secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement Buddhist feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious legal and social status of women within Buddhism It is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally socially spiritually and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective The Buddhist feminist Rita Gross describes Buddhist feminism as the radical practice of the cohumanity of women and men Jewish feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious legal and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the allmale prayer group or minyan the exemption from positive timebound mitzvot and womens inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history Dianic Wicca is a feministcentred thealogy Secular or atheist feminists have engaged in feminist criticism of religion arguing that many religions have oppressive rules towards women and misogynistic themes and elements in religious texts Patriarchy Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures In this system fathers have authority over women children and property It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and is dependent on female subordination Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women Carole Pateman argues that the patriarchal distinction between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection In feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations Some radical feminists have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society separatism is the only viable solution Other feminists have criticized these views as being antimen Men and masculinity Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations Patriarchal cultures are criticized for limiting forms of masculinity available to men and thus narrowing their life choices Some feminists are engaged with mens issues activism such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men Male participation in feminism is generally encouraged by feminists and is seen as an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality Many male feminists and profeminists are active in both womens rights activism feminist theory and masculinity studies However some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that men and women should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism Reactions Different groups of people have responded to feminism and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics Among American university students for both men and women support for feminist ideas is more common than selfidentification as a feminist The US media tends to portray feminism negatively and feminists are less often associated with daytoday workleisure activities of regular women However as recent research has demonstrated as people are exposed to selfidentified feminists and to discussions relating to various forms of feminism their own selfidentification with feminism increases Profeminism Profeminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism The activities of profeminist mens groups include antiviolence work with boys and young men in schools offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces running community education campaigns and counselling male perpetrators of violence Profeminist men also may be involved in mens health activism against pornography including antipornography legislation mens studies and the development of gender equity curricula in schools This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and womens services such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres Antifeminism and criticism of feminism Antifeminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms In the 19th century antifeminism was mainly focused on opposition to womens suffrage Later opponents of womens entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women Other antifeminists opposed womens entry into the labour force or their right to join unions to sit on juries or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs Some antifeminists argue for example that social acceptance of divorce and nonmarried women is wrong and harmful and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained Other antifeminists oppose womens entry into the workforce political office and the voting process as well as the lessening of male authority in families Writers such as Camille Paglia Christina Hoff Sommers Jean Bethke Elshtain Elizabeth FoxGenovese and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism though they identify as feminists They argue for example that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of womens interests above mens and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge argue that the term antifeminist is used to silence academic debate about feminism A metaanalysis in 2023 published in the journal Psychology of Women Quarterly investigated the stereotype of feminists attitudes to men and concluded that feminist views of men were no different to that of nonfeminists or men towards men and titled the phenomenon the misandry myth based on evidence that it is false and widespread Secular humanism Secular humanism is an ethical framework that attempts to dispense with any unreasoned dogma pseudoscience and superstition Critics of feminism sometimes ask Why feminism and not humanism Some humanists argue however that the goals of feminists and humanists largely overlap and the distinction is only in motivation For example a humanist may consider abortion in terms of a utilitarian ethical framework rather than considering the motivation of any particular woman in getting an abortion In this respect it is possible to be a humanist without being a feminist but this does not preclude the existence of feminist humanism Humanism played a significant role in protofeminism during the Renaissance period in such that humanists made educated women popular figures

    title: "Higgs boson",
    originalContent:
      "The Higgs boson sometimes called the Higgs particle is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics produced by the quantum excitation of the Higgs field one of the fields in particle physics theory In the Standard Model the Higgs particle is a massive scalar boson with zero spin even positive parity no electric charge and no colour charge that couples to interacts with mass It is also very unstable decaying into other particles almost immediately upon generation The Higgs field is a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU2 symmetry Its Sombrero potential leads it to take a nonzero value everywhere including otherwise empty space which breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction and via the Higgs mechanism gives a rest mass to all massive elementary particles of the Standard Model including the Higgs boson itself The existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and for several decades was considered the central problem in particle physics Both the field and the boson are named after physicist Peter Higgs who in 1964 along with five other scientists in three teams proposed the Higgs mechanism a way for some particles to acquire mass All fundamental particles known at the time should be massless at very high energies but fully explaining how some particles gain mass at lower energies had been extremely difficult If these ideas were correct a particle known as a scalar boson should also exist with certain properties This particle was called the Higgs boson and could be used to test whether the Higgs field was the correct explanation After a 40year search a subatomic particle with the expected properties was discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN near Geneva Switzerland The new particle was subsequently confirmed to match the expected properties of a Higgs boson Physicists from two of the three teams Peter Higgs and Franois Englert were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 for their theoretical predictions Although Higgss name has come to be associated with this theory several researchers between about 1960 and 1972 independently developed different parts of it In the media the Higgs boson has often been called the God particle after the 1993 book The God Particle by Nobel Laureate Leon Lederman The name has been criticised by physicists including Peter Higgs Introduction Standard Model Physicists explain the fundamental particles and forces of our universe in terms of the Standard Model a widely accepted framework based on quantum field theory that predicts almost all known particles and forces aside from gravity with great accuracy A separate theory general relativity is used for gravity In the Standard Model the particles and forces in nature aside from gravity arise from properties of quantum fields known as gauge invariance and symmetries Forces in the Standard Model are transmitted by particles known as gauge bosons Gauge invariant theories and symmetries It is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry Philip Anderson Nobel Prize Physics Gauge invariant theories are theories which have a useful feature ie some kinds of changes to the value of certain items do not make any difference to the outcomes or the measurements we make For example changing voltages in an electromagnet by 100 volts does not cause any change to the magnetic field it produces Similarly measuring the speed of light in vacuum seems to give the identical result whatever the location in time and space and whatever the local gravitational field In these kinds of theories the gauge is an item whose value we can change The fact that some changes leave the results we measure unchanged means it is a gauge invariant theory and symmetries are the specific kinds of changes to the gauge which have the effect of leaving measurements unchanged Symmetries of this kind are powerful tools for a deep understanding of the fundamental forces and particles of our physical world Gauge invariance is therefore an important property within particle physics theory They are closely connected to conservation laws and are described mathematically using group theory Quantum field theory and the Standard Model are both gauge invariant theories meaning they focus on properties of our universe demonstrating this property of gauge invariance and the symmetries which are involved Gauge boson rest mass problem Quantum field theories based on gauge invariance had been used with great success in understanding the electromagnetic and strong forces but by around 1960 all attempts to create a gauge invariant theory for the weak force and its combination with the electromagnetic force known together as the electroweak interaction had consistently failed As a result of these failures gauge theories began to fall into disrepute The problem was symmetry requirements for these two forces incorrectly predicted the weak forces gauge bosons W and Z would have zero mass in the specialized terminology of particle physics mass refers specifically to a particles rest mass But experiments showed the W and Z gauge bosons had nonzero rest mass Further many promising solutions seemed to require the existence of extra particles known as Goldstone bosons But evidence suggested these did not exist either This meant either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach or something unknown was giving the weak forces W and Z bosons their mass and doing it in a way that did not create Goldstone bosons By the late 1950s and early 1960s physicists were at a loss as to how to resolve these issues or how to create a comprehensive theory for particle physics Symmetry breaking In the late 1950s Yoichiro Nambu recognised that spontaneous symmetry breaking a process where a symmetric system becomes asymmetric could occur under certain conditions Symmetry breaking is when some variable that previously didnt affect the measured results it was originally a symmetry now does affect the measured results its now broken and no longer a symmetry In 1962 physicist Philip Anderson an expert in condensed matter physics observed that symmetry breaking played a role in superconductivity and suggested it could also be part of the answer to the problem of gauge invariance in particle physics Specifically Anderson suggested that the Goldstone bosons that would result from symmetry breaking might instead in some circumstances be absorbed by the massless W and Z bosons If so perhaps the Goldstone bosons would not exist and the W and Z bosons could gain mass solving both problems at once Similar behaviour was already theorised in superconductivity In 1964 this was shown to be theoretically possible by physicists Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee at least for some limited nonrelativistic cases Higgs mechanism Following the 1963 and early 1964 papers three groups of researchers independently developed these theories more completely in what became known as the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers All three groups reached similar conclusions and for all cases not just some limited cases They showed that the conditions for electroweak symmetry would be broken if an unusual type of field existed throughout the universe and indeed there would be no Goldstone bosons and some existing bosons would acquire mass The field required for this to happen which was purely hypothetical at the time became known as the Higgs field after Peter Higgs one of the researchers and the mechanism by which it led to symmetry breaking became known as the Higgs mechanism A key feature of the necessary field is that it would take less energy for the field to have a nonzero value than a zero value unlike all other known fields therefore the Higgs field has a nonzero value or vacuum expectation everywhere This nonzero value could in theory break electroweak symmetry It was the first proposal capable of showing how the weak force gauge bosons could have mass despite their governing symmetry within a gauge invariant theory Although these ideas did not gain much initial support or attention by 1972 they had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving sensible results that accurately described particles known at the time and which with exceptional accuracy predicted several other particles discovered during the following years During the 1970s these theories rapidly became the Standard Model of particle physics Higgs field To allow symmetry breaking the Standard Model includes a field of the kind needed to break electroweak symmetry and give particles their correct mass This field which became known as the Higgs Field was hypothesized to exist throughout space and to break some symmetry laws of the electroweak interaction triggering the Higgs mechanism It therefore would cause the W and Z gauge bosons of the weak force to be massive at all temperatures below an extremely high value When the weak force bosons acquire mass this affects the distance they can freely travel which becomes very small also matching experimental findings Furthermore it was later realised that the same field would also explain in a different way why other fundamental constituents of matter including electrons and quarks have mass Unlike all other known fields such as the electromagnetic field the Higgs field is a scalar field and has a nonzero average value in vacuum The central problem There was not yet any direct evidence that the Higgs field existed but even without direct proof the accuracy of its predictions led scientists to believe the theory might be true By the 1980s the question of whether the Higgs field existed and therefore whether the entire Standard Model was correct had come to be regarded as one of the most important unanswered questions in particle physics The existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and for several decades was considered the central problem in particle physics For many decades scientists had no way to determine whether the Higgs field existed because the technology needed for its detection did not exist at that time If the Higgs field did exist then it would be unlike any other known fundamental field but it also was possible that these key ideas or even the entire Standard Model were somehow incorrect The hypothesised Higgs theory made several key predictions 22 One crucial prediction was that a matching particle called the Higgs boson should also exist Proving the existence of the Higgs boson would prove whether the Higgs field existed and therefore finally prove whether the Standard Models explanation was correct Therefore there was an extensive search for the Higgs boson as a way to prove the Higgs field itself existed Search and discovery Although the Higgs field would exist everywhere proving its existence was far from easy In principle it can be proved to exist by detecting its excitations which manifest as Higgs particles the Higgs boson but these are extremely difficult to produce and detect due to the energy required to produce them and their very rare production even if the energy is sufficient It was therefore several decades before the first evidence of the Higgs boson could be found Particle colliders detectors and computers capable of looking for Higgs bosons took more than 30 years c 19802010 to develop The importance of this fundamental question led to a 40year search and the construction of one of the worlds most expensive and complex experimental facilities to date CERNs Large Hadron Collider in an attempt to create Higgs bosons and other particles for observation and study On 4 July 2012 the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and 127 GeVc2 was announced physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson Since then the particle has been shown to behave interact and decay in many of the ways predicted for Higgs particles by the Standard Model as well as having even parity and zero spin two fundamental attributes of a Higgs boson This also means it is the first elementary scalar particle discovered in nature By March 2013 the existence of the Higgs boson was confirmed and therefore the concept of some type of Higgs field throughout space is strongly supported The presence of the field now confirmed by experimental investigation explains why some fundamental particles have a rest mass despite the symmetries controlling their interactions implying that they should be massless It also resolves several other longstanding puzzles such as the reason for the extremely short distance travelled by the weak force bosons and therefore the weak forces extremely short range As of 2018 indepth research shows the particle continuing to behave in line with predictions for the Standard Model Higgs boson More studies are needed to verify with higher precision that the discovered particle has all of the properties predicted or whether as described by some theories multiple Higgs bosons exist The nature and properties of this field are now being investigated further using more data collected at the LHC Interpretation Various analogies have been used to describe the Higgs field and boson including analogies with wellknown symmetrybreaking effects such as the rainbow and prism electric fields and ripples on the surface of water Other analogies based on the resistance of macro objects moving through media such as people moving through crowds or some objects moving through syrup or molasses are commonly used but misleading since the Higgs field does not actually resist particles and the effect of mass is not caused by resistance Overview of Higgs boson and field properties In the Standard Model the Higgs boson is a massive scalar boson whose mass must be found experimentally Its mass has been determined to be 12535015 GeVc2 by CMS 2022 and 12511011 GeVc2 by ATLAS 2023 It is the only particle that remains massive even at very high energies It has zero spin even positive parity no electric charge and no colour charge and it couples to interacts with mass It is also very unstable decaying into other particles almost immediately via several possible pathways The Higgs field is a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU2 symmetry Unlike any other known quantum field it has a Sombrero potential This shape means that below extremely high energies of about 159515 GeV such as those seen during the first picosecond 1012 s of the Big Bang the Higgs field in its ground state takes less energy to have a nonzero vacuum expectation value than a zero value Therefore in todays universe the Higgs field has a nonzero value everywhere including otherwise empty space This nonzero value in turn breaks the weak isospin SU2 symmetry of the electroweak interaction everywhere Technically the nonzero expectation value converts the Lagrangians Yukawa coupling terms into mass terms When this happens three components of the Higgs field are absorbed by the SU2 and U1 gauge bosons the Higgs mechanism to become the longitudinal components of the nowmassive W and Z bosons of the weak force The remaining electrically neutral component either manifests as a Higgs boson or may couple separately to other particles known as fermions via Yukawa couplings causing these to acquire mass as well Significance Evidence of the Higgs field and its properties has been extremely significant for many reasons The importance of the Higgs boson largely is that it is able to be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory Conversely proof that the Higgs field and boson did not exist would have also been significant Particle physics Validation of the Standard Model The Higgs boson validates the Standard Model through the mechanism of mass generation As more precise measurements of its properties are made more advanced extensions may be suggested or excluded As experimental means to measure the fields behaviours and interactions are developed this fundamental field may be better understood If the Higgs field had not been discovered the Standard Model would have needed to be modified or superseded Related to this a belief generally exists among physicists that there is likely to be new physics beyond the Standard Model and the Standard Model will at some point be extended or superseded The Higgs discovery as well as the many measured collisions occurring at the LHC provide physicists a sensitive tool to search their data for any evidence that the Standard Model seems to fail and could provide considerable evidence guiding researchers into future theoretical developments Symmetry breaking of the electroweak interaction Below an extremely high temperature electroweak symmetry breaking causes the electroweak interaction to manifest in part as the shortranged weak force which is carried by massive gauge bosons In the history of the universe electroweak symmetry breaking is believed to have happened at about 1 picosecond 1012 s after the Big Bang when the universe was at a temperature 159515 GeVkB This symmetry breaking is required for atoms and other structures to form as well as for nuclear reactions in stars such as the Sun The Higgs field is responsible for this symmetry breaking Particle mass acquisition The Higgs field is pivotal in generating the masses of quarks and charged leptons through Yukawa coupling and the W and Z gauge bosons through the Higgs mechanism The Higgs field does not create mass out of nothing which would violate the law of conservation of energy nor is the Higgs field responsible for the mass of all particles For example approximately 99 of the mass of baryons composite particles such as the proton and neutron is due instead to quantum chromodynamic binding energy which is the sum of the kinetic energies of quarks and the energies of the massless gluons mediating the strong interaction inside the baryons In Higgsbased theories the property of mass is a manifestation of potential energy transferred to fundamental particles when they interact couple with the Higgs field which had contained that mass in the form of energy Scalar fields and extension of the Standard Model The Higgs field is the only scalar spin0 field to be detected all the other fundamental fields in the Standard Model are spin 1 2 fermions or spin1 bosons According to RolfDieter Heuer director general of CERN when the Higgs boson was discovered this existence proof of a scalar field is almost as important as the Higgss role in determining the mass of other particles It suggests that other hypothetical scalar fields suggested by other theories from the inflaton to quintessence could perhaps exist as well Cosmology Inflaton There has been considerable scientific research on possible links between the Higgs field and the inflaton a hypothetical field suggested as the explanation for the expansion of space during the first fraction of a second of the universe known as the inflationary epoch Some theories suggest that a fundamental scalar field might be responsible for this phenomenon the Higgs field is such a field and its existence has led to papers analysing whether it could also be the inflaton responsible for this exponential expansion of the universe during the Big Bang Such theories are highly tentative and face significant problems related to unitarity but may be viable if combined with additional features such as large nonminimal coupling a BransDicke scalar or other new physics and they have received treatments suggesting that Higgs inflation models are still of interest theoretically Nature of the universe and its possible fates In the Standard Model there exists the possibility that the underlying state of our universe known as the vacuum is longlived but not completely stable In this scenario the universe as we know it could effectively be destroyed by collapsing into a more stable vacuum state This was sometimes misreported as the Higgs boson ending the universe If the masses of the Higgs boson and top quark are known more precisely and the Standard Model provides an accurate description of particle physics up to extreme energies of the Planck scale then it is possible to calculate whether the vacuum is stable or merely longlived A Higgs mass of 125127 GeVc2 seems to be extremely close to the boundary for stability but a definitive answer requires much more precise measurements of the pole mass of the top quark New physics can change this picture If measurements of the Higgs boson suggest that our universe lies within a false vacuum of this kind then it would imply more than likely in many billions of years that the universes forces particles and structures could cease to exist as we know them and be replaced by different ones if a true vacuum happened to nucleate It also suggests that the Higgs selfcoupling and its function could be very close to zero at the Planck scale with intriguing implications including theories of gravity and Higgsbased inflation 218 A future electronpositron collider would be able to provide the precise measurements of the top quark needed for such calculations Vacuum energy and the cosmological constant More speculatively the Higgs field has also been proposed as the energy of the vacuum which at the extreme energies of the first moments of the Big Bang caused the universe to be a kind of featureless symmetry of undifferentiated extremely high energy In this kind of speculation the single unified field of a Grand Unified Theory is identified as or modelled upon the Higgs field and it is through successive symmetry breakings of the Higgs field or some similar field at phase transitions that the presently known forces and fields of the universe arise The relationship if any between the Higgs field and the presently observed vacuum energy density of the universe has also come under scientific study As observed the present vacuum energy density is extremely close to zero but the energy densities predicted from the Higgs field supersymmetry and other current theories are typically many orders of magnitude larger It is unclear how these should be reconciled This cosmological constant problem remains a major unanswered problem in physics History Theorisation Particle physicists study matter made from fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles gauge bosons acting as force carriers At the beginning of the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed along with theories suggesting how they relate to each other some of which had already been reformulated as field theories in which the objects of study are not particles and forces but quantum fields and their symmetries 150 However attempts to produce quantum field models for two of the four known fundamental forces the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force and then to unify these interactions were still unsuccessful One known problem was that gauge invariant approaches including nonabelian models such as YangMills theory 1954 which held great promise for unified theories also seemed to predict known massive particles as massless Goldstones theorem relating to continuous symmetries within some theories also appeared to rule out many obvious solutions since it appeared to show that zeromass particles known as Goldstone bosons would also have to exist that simply were not seen According to Guralnik physicists had no understanding how these problems could be overcome Particle physicist and mathematician Peter Woit summarised the state of research at the timeYang and Mills work on nonabelian gauge theory had one huge problem in perturbation theory it has massless particles which dont correspond to anything we see One way of getting rid of this problem is now fairly well understood the phenomenon of confinement realized in QCD where the strong interactions get rid of the massless gluon states at long distances By the very early sixties people had begun to understand another source of massless particles spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous symmetry What Philip Anderson realized and worked out in the summer of 1962 was that when you have both gauge symmetry and spontaneous symmetry breaking the massless NambuGoldstone mode which gives rise to Goldstone bosons can combine with the massless gauge field modes which give rise to massless gauge bosons to produce a physical massive vector field gauge bosons with mass This is what happens in superconductivity a subject about which Anderson was and is one of the leading experts text condensed The Higgs mechanism is a process by which vector bosons can acquire rest mass without explicitly breaking gauge invariance as a byproduct of spontaneous symmetry breaking Initially the mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was conceived and published within particle physics by Yoichiro Nambu in 1960 and somewhat anticipated by Ernst Stueckelberg in 1938 and the concept that such a mechanism could offer a possible solution for the mass problem was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson who had previously written papers on broken symmetry and its outcomes in superconductivity Anderson concluded in his 1963 paper on the YangMills theory that considering the superconducting analog these two types of bosons seem capable of canceling each other out leaving finite mass bosons and in March 1964 Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee showed that Goldstones theorem could be avoided this way in at least some nonrelativistic cases and speculated it might be possible in truly relativistic cases These approaches were quickly developed into a full relativistic model independently and almost simultaneously by three groups of physicists by Franois Englert and Robert Brout in August 1964 by Peter Higgs in October 1964 and by Gerald Guralnik Carl Hagen and Tom Kibble GHK in November 1964 Higgs also wrote a short but important response published in September 1964 to an objection by Gilbert which showed that if calculating within the radiation gauge Goldstones theorem and Gilberts objection would become inapplicable Higgs later described Gilberts objection as prompting his own paper Properties of the model were further considered by Guralnik in 1965 by Higgs in 1966 by Kibble in 1967 and further by GHK in 1967 The original three 1964 papers demonstrated that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional charged scalar field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry the gauge bosons may consistently acquire a finite mass In 1967 Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how a Higgs mechanism could be used to break the electroweak symmetry of Sheldon Glashows unified model for the weak and electromagnetic interactions itself an extension of work by Schwinger forming what became the Standard Model of particle physics Weinberg was the first to observe that this would also provide mass terms for the fermions At first these seminal papers on spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries were largely ignored because it was widely believed that the nonAbelian gauge theories in question were a deadend and in particular that they could not be renormalised In 197172 Martinus Veltman and Gerard t Hooft proved renormalisation of YangMills was possible in two papers covering massless and then massive fields Their contribution and the work of others on the renormalisation group including substantial theoretical work by Russian physicists Ludvig Faddeev Andrei Slavnov Efim Fradkin and Igor Tyutin was eventually enormously profound and influential but even with all key elements of the eventual theory published there was still almost no wider interest For example Coleman found in a study that essentially noone paid any attention to Weinbergs paper prior to 1971 and discussed by David Politzer in his 2004 Nobel speech now the most cited in particle physics and even in 1970 according to Politzer Glashows teaching of the weak interaction contained no mention of Weinbergs Salams or Glashows own work In practice Politzer states almost everyone learned of the theory due to physicist Benjamin Lee who combined the work of Veltman and t Hooft with insights by others and popularised the completed theory In this way from 1971 interest and acceptance exploded and the ideas were quickly absorbed in the mainstream The resulting electroweak theory and Standard Model have accurately predicted among other things weak neutral currents three bosons the top and charm quarks and with great precision the mass and other properties of some of these Many of those involved eventually won Nobel Prizes or other renowned awards A 1974 paper and comprehensive review in Reviews of Modern Physics commented that while no one doubted the mathematical correctness of these arguments no one quite believed that nature was diabolically clever enough to take advantage of them adding that the theory had so far produced accurate answers that accorded with experiment but it was unknown whether the theory was fundamentally correct By 1986 and again in the 1990s it became possible to write that understanding and proving the Higgs sector of the Standard Model was the central problem today in particle physics Summary and impact of the PRL papers The three papers written in 1964 were each recognised as milestone papers during Physical Review Letterss 50th anniversary celebration Their six authors were also awarded the 2010 J J Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work A controversy also arose the same year because in the event of a Nobel Prize only up to three scientists could be recognised with six being credited for the papers Two of the three PRL papers by Higgs and by GHK contained equations for the hypothetical field that eventually would become known as the Higgs field and its hypothetical quantum the Higgs boson Higgs subsequent 1966 paper showed the decay mechanism of the boson only a massive boson can decay and the decays can prove the mechanism In the paper by Higgs the boson is massive and in a closing sentence Higgs writes that an essential feature of the theory is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons Frank Close comments that 1960s gauge theorists were focused on the problem of massless vector bosons and the implied existence of a massive scalar boson was not seen as important only Higgs directly addressed it 154 166 175 In the paper by GHK the boson is massless and decoupled from the massive states In reviews dated 2009 and 2011 Guralnik states that in the GHK model the boson is massless only in a lowestorder approximation but it is not subject to any constraint and acquires mass at higher orders and adds that the GHK paper was the only one to show that there are no massless Goldstone bosons in the model and to give a complete analysis of the general Higgs mechanism All three reached similar conclusions despite their very different approaches Higgs paper essentially used classical techniques Englert and Brouts involved calculating vacuum polarisation in perturbation theory around an assumed symmetrybreaking vacuum state and GHK used operator formalism and conservation laws to explore in depth the ways in which Goldstones theorem may be worked around Some versions of the theory predicted more than one kind of Higgs fields and bosons and alternative Higgsless models were considered until the discovery of the Higgs boson Experimental search To produce Higgs bosons two beams of particles are accelerated to very high energies and allowed to collide within a particle detector Occasionally although rarely a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts Because the Higgs boson decays very quickly particle detectors cannot detect it directly Instead the detectors register all the decay products the decay signature and from the data the decay process is reconstructed If the observed decay products match a possible decay process known as a decay channel of a Higgs boson this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created In practice many processes may produce similar decay signatures Fortunately the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these and each known process occurring So if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists Because Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare 1 in 10 billion at the LHC and many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must show the same picture before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached To conclude that a new particle has been found particle physicists require that the statistical analysis of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is less than a oneinamillion chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events ie that the observed number of events is more than five standard deviations sigma different from that expected if there was no new particle More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle To find the Higgs boson a powerful particle accelerator was needed because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lowerenergy experiments The collider needed to have a high luminosity in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn Finally advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data 25 petabytes per year as of 2012 produced by the collisions For the announcement of 4 July 2012 a new collider known as the Large Hadron Collider was constructed at CERN with a planned eventual collision energy of 14 TeV over seven times any previous collider and over 300 trillion 31014 LHC protonproton collisions were analysed by the LHC Computing Grid the worlds largest computing grid as of 2012 comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide network across 36 countries Search before 4 July 2012 The first extensive search for the Higgs boson was conducted at the Large ElectronPositron Collider LEP at CERN in the 1990s At the end of its service in 2000 LEP had found no conclusive evidence for the Higgs This implied that if the Higgs boson were to exist it would have to be heavier than 1144 GeVc2 The search continued at Fermilab in the United States where the Tevatron the collider that discovered the top quark in 1995 had been upgraded for this purpose There was no guarantee that the Tevatron would be able to find the Higgs but it was the only supercollider that was operational since the Large Hadron Collider LHC was still under construction and the planned Superconducting Super Collider had been cancelled in 1993 and never completed The Tevatron was only able to exclude further ranges for the Higgs mass and was shut down on 30 September 2011 because it no longer could keep up with the LHC The final analysis of the data excluded the possibility of a Higgs boson with a mass between 147 GeVc2 and 180 GeVc2 In addition there was a small but not significant excess of events possibly indicating a Higgs boson with a mass between 115 GeVc2 and 140 GeVc2 The Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland was designed specifically to be able to either confirm or exclude the existence of the Higgs boson Built in a 27 km tunnel under the ground near Geneva originally inhabited by LEP it was designed to collide two beams of protons initially at energies of 35 TeV per beam 7 TeV total or almost 36 times that of the Tevatron and upgradeable to 2 7 TeV 14 TeV total in future Theory suggested if the Higgs boson existed collisions at these energy levels should be able to reveal it As one of the most complicated scientific instruments ever built its operational readiness was delayed for 14 months by a magnet quench event nine days after its inaugural tests caused by a faulty electrical connection that damaged over 50 superconducting magnets and contaminated the vacuum system Data collection at the LHC finally commenced in March 2010 By December 2011 the two main particle detectors at the LHC ATLAS and CMS had narrowed down the mass range where the Higgs could exist to around 116130 GeVc2 ATLAS and 115127 GeVc2 CMS There had also already been a number of promising event excesses that had evaporated and proven to be nothing but random fluctuations However from around May 2011 both experiments had seen among their results the slow emergence of a small yet consistent excess of gamma and 4lepton decay signatures and several other particle decays all hinting at a new particle at a mass around 125 GeVc2 By around November 2011 the anomalous data at 125 GeVc2 was becoming too large to ignore although still far from conclusive and the team leaders at both ATLAS and CMS each privately suspected they might have found the Higgs On 28 November 2011 at an internal meeting of the two team leaders and the director general of CERN the latest analyses were discussed outside their teams for the first time suggesting both ATLAS and CMS might be converging on a possible shared result at 125 GeVc2 and initial preparations commenced in case of a successful finding While this information was not known publicly at the time the narrowing of the possible Higgs range to around 115130 GeV2 and the repeated observation of small but consistent event excesses across multiple channels at both ATLAS and CMS in the 124126 GeVc2 region described as tantalising hints of around 23 sigma were public knowledge with a lot of interest It was therefore widely anticipated around the end of 2011 that the LHC would provide sufficient data to either exclude or confirm the finding of a Higgs boson by the end of 2012 when their 2012 collision data with slightly higher 8 TeV collision energy had been examined Discovery of candidate boson at CERN On 22 June 2012 CERN announced an upcoming seminar covering tentative findings for 2012 and shortly afterwards from around 1 July 2012 according to an analysis of the spreading rumour in social media rumours began to spread in the media that this would include a major announcement but it was unclear whether this would be a stronger signal or a formal discovery Speculation escalated to a fevered pitch when reports emerged that Peter Higgs who proposed the particle was to be attending the seminar and that five leading physicists had been invited generally believed to signify the five living 1964 authors with Higgs Englert Guralnik Hagen attending and Kibble confirming his invitation Brout having died in 2011 On 4 July 2012 both of the CERN experiments announced they had independently made the same discovery CMS of a previously unknown boson with mass 125306 GeVc2 and ATLAS of a boson with mass 126006 GeVc2 Using the combined analysis of two interaction types known as channels both experiments independently reached a local significance of 5 sigma implying that the probability of getting at least as strong a result by chance alone is less than one in three million When additional channels were taken into account the CMS significance was reduced to 49 sigma The two teams had been working blinded from each other from around late 2011 or early 2012 meaning they did not discuss their results with each other providing additional certainty that any common finding was genuine validation of a particle This level of evidence confirmed independently by two separate teams and experiments meets the formal level of proof required to announce a confirmed discovery On 31 July 2012 the ATLAS collaboration presented additional data analysis on the observation of a new particle including data from a third channel which improved the significance to 59 sigma 1 in 588 million chance of obtaining at least as strong evidence by random background effects alone and mass 1260 04 stat 04 sys GeVc2 and CMS improved the significance to 5sigma and mass 1253 04 stat 05 sys GeVc2 New particle tested as a possible Higgs boson Following the 2012 discovery it was still unconfirmed whether the 125 GeVc2 particle was a Higgs boson On one hand observations remained consistent with the observed particle being the Standard Model Higgs boson and the particle decayed into at least some of the predicted channels Moreover the production rates and branching ratios for the observed channels broadly matched the predictions by the Standard Model within the experimental uncertainties However the experimental uncertainties currently still left room for alternative explanations meaning an announcement of the discovery of a Higgs boson would have been premature To allow more opportunity for data collection the LHCs proposed 2012 shutdown and 201314 upgrade were postponed by seven weeks into 2013 In November 2012 in a conference in Kyoto researchers said evidence gathered since July was falling into line with the basic Standard Model more than its alternatives with a range of results for several interactions matching that theorys predictions Physicist Matt Strassler highlighted considerable evidence that the new particle is not a pseudoscalar negative parity particle consistent with this required finding for a Higgs boson evaporation or lack of increased significance for previous hints of nonStandard Model findings expected Standard Model interactions with W and Z bosons absence of significant new implications for or against supersymmetry and in general no significant deviations to date from the results expected of a Standard Model Higgs boson However some kinds of extensions to the Standard Model would also show very similar results so commentators noted that based on other particles that are still being understood long after their discovery it may take years to be sure and decades to fully understand the particle that has been found These findings meant that as of January 2013 scientists were very sure they had found an unknown particle of mass 125 GeVc2 and had not been misled by experimental error or a chance result They were also sure from initial observations that the new particle was some kind of boson The behaviours and properties of the particle so far as examined since July 2012 also seemed quite close to the behaviours expected of a Higgs boson Even so it could still have been a Higgs boson or some other unknown boson since future tests could show behaviours that do not match a Higgs boson so as of December 2012 CERN still only stated that the new particle was consistent with the Higgs boson and scientists did not yet positively say it was the Higgs boson Despite this in late 2012 widespread media reports announced incorrectly that a Higgs boson had been confirmed during the year In January 2013 CERN directorgeneral RolfDieter Heuer stated that based on data analysis to date an answer could be possible towards mid2013 and the deputy chair of physics at Brookhaven National Laboratory stated in February 2013 that a definitive answer might require another few years after the colliders 2015 restart In early March 2013 CERN Research Director Sergio Bertolucci stated that confirming spin0 was the major remaining requirement to determine whether the particle is at least some kind of Higgs boson Confirmation of existence and current status On 14 March 2013 CERN confirmed the following CMS and ATLAS have compared a number of options for the spinparity of this particle and these all prefer no spin and even parity two fundamental criteria of a Higgs boson consistent with the Standard Model This coupled with the measured interactions of the new particle with other particles strongly indicates that it is a Higgs boson This also makes the particle the first elementary scalar particle to be discovered in nature The following are examples of tests used to confirm that the discovered particle is the Higgs boson Findings since 2013 In July 2017 CERN confirmed that all measurements still agree with the predictions of the Standard Model and called the discovered particle simply the Higgs boson As of 2019 the Large Hadron Collider has continued to produce findings that confirm the 2013 understanding of the Higgs field and particle The LHCs experimental work since restarting in 2015 has included probing the Higgs field and boson to a greater level of detail and confirming whether less common predictions were correct In particular exploration since 2015 has provided strong evidence of the predicted direct decay into fermions such as pairs of bottom quarks 36 described as an important milestone in understanding its short lifetime and other rare decays and also to confirm decay into pairs of tau leptons 59 This was described by CERN as being of paramount importance to establishing the coupling of the Higgs boson to leptons and represents an important step towards measuring its couplings to third generation fermions the very heavy copies of the electrons and quarks whose role in nature is a profound mystery Published results as of 19 March 2018 at 13 TeV for ATLAS and CMS had their measurements of the Higgs mass at 12498028 GeVc2 and 12526021 GeVc2 respectively In July 2018 the ATLAS and CMS experiments reported observing the Higgs boson decay into a pair of bottom quarks which makes up approximately 60 of all of its decays Theoretical issues Theoretical need for the Higgs Gauge invariance is an important property of modern particle theories such as the Standard Model partly due to its success in other areas of fundamental physics such as electromagnetism and the strong interaction quantum chromodynamics However before Sheldon Glashow extended the electroweak unification models in 1961 there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the weak nuclear force or a possible unified electroweak interaction Fermions with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant This can be seen by examining the Dirac Lagrangian for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components we find none of the spinhalf particles could ever flip helicity as required for mass so they must be massless W and Z bosons are observed to have mass but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant Therefore it seems that none of the standard model fermions or bosons could begin with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance If gauge invariance were to be retained then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction Additionally solutions based on spontaneous symmetry breaking appeared to fail seemingly an inevitable result of Goldstones theorem Because there is no potential energy cost to moving around the complex planes circular valley responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking the resulting quantum excitation is pure kinetic energy and therefore a massless boson Goldstone boson which in turn implies a new long range force But no new long range forces or massless particles were detected either So whatever was giving these particles their mass had to not break gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well and had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles or longrange forces which did not actually seem to exist in nature A solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstones theorem that under certain conditions it might theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken without disrupting gauge invariance and without any new massless particles or forces and having sensible renormalisable results mathematically This became known as the Higgs mechanism The Standard Model hypothesises a field which is responsible for this effect called the Higgs field symbol displaystyle phi which has the unusual property of a nonzero amplitude in its ground state ie a nonzero vacuum expectation value It can have this effect because of its unusual Mexican hat shaped potential whose lowest point is not at its centre In simple terms unlike all other known fields the Higgs field requires less energy to have a nonzero value than a zero value so it ends up having a nonzero value everywhere Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this nonzero vacuum expectation spontaneously breaks electroweak gauge symmetry which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field This effect occurs because scalar field components of the Higgs field are absorbed by the massive bosons as degrees of freedom and couple to the fermions via Yukawa coupling thereby producing the expected mass terms When symmetry breaks under these conditions the Goldstone bosons that arise interact with the Higgs field and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field instead of becoming new massless particles The intractable problems of both underlying theories neutralise each other and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field It is the simplest known process capable of giving mass to the gauge bosons while remaining compatible with gauge theories Its quantum would be a scalar boson known as the Higgs boson Simple explanation of the theory from its origins in superconductivity The proposed Higgs mechanism arose as a result of theories proposed to explain observations in superconductivity A superconductor does not allow penetration by external magnetic fields the Meissner effect This strange observation implies that somehow the electromagnetic field becomes short ranged during this phenomenon Successful theories arose to explain this during the 1950s first for fermions GinzburgLandau theory 1950 and then for bosons BCS theory 1957 In these theories superconductivity is interpreted as arising from a charged condensate field Initially the condensate value does not have any preferred direction implying it is scalar but its phase is capable of defining a gauge in gauge based field theories To do this the field must be charged A charged scalar field must also be complex or described another way it contains at least two components and a symmetry capable of rotating each into the others In nave gauge theory a gauge transformation of a condensate usually rotates the phase But in these circumstances it instead fixes a preferred choice of phase However it turns out that fixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere also causes the electromagnetic field to gain an extra term This extra term causes the electromagnetic field to become short range Once attention was drawn to this theory within particle physics the parallels were clear A change of the usually long range electromagnetic field to become short ranged within a gauge invariant theory was exactly the needed effect sought for the weak force bosons because a long range force has massless gauge bosons and a short ranged force implies massive gauge bosons suggesting that a result of this interaction is that the fields gauge bosons acquired mass or a similar and equivalent effect The features of a field required to do this were also quite well defined it would have to be a charged scalar field with at least two components and complex in order to support a symmetry able to rotate these into each other Alternative models The Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field However an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature The nonminimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the twoHiggsdoublet models 2HDM which predict the existence of a quintet of scalar particles two CPeven neutral Higgs bosons h0 and H0 a CPodd neutral Higgs boson A0 and two charged Higgs particles H Supersymmetry SUSY also predicts relations between the Higgsboson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons and could accommodate a 125 GeVc2 neutral Higgs boson The key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles interactions coupling and exact decay processes branching ratios which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions In the TypeI 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks while the second doublet does not couple to quarks This model has two interesting limits in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions gaugephobic or just gauge bosons fermiophobic but not both In the TypeII 2HDM model one Higgs doublet only couples to uptype quarks the other only couples to downtype quarks The heavily researched Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model MSSM includes a TypeII 2HDM Higgs sector so it could be disproven by evidence of a TypeI 2HDM Higgs In other models the Higgs scalar is a composite particle For example in technicolour the role of the Higgs field is played by strongly bound pairs of fermions called techniquarks Other models feature pairs of top quarks see top quark condensate In yet other models there is no Higgs field at all and the electroweak symmetry is broken using extra dimensions Further theoretical issues and hierarchy problem The Standard Model leaves the mass of the Higgs boson as a parameter to be measured rather than a value to be calculated This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory particularly as quantum corrections related to interactions with virtual particles should apparently cause the Higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed but at the same time the Standard Model requires a mass of the order of 100 to 1000 GeVc2 to ensure unitarity in this case to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almostperfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of 125 GeVc2 and it is not clear how to do this Because the weak force is about 1032 times stronger than gravity and linked to this the Higgs bosons mass is so much less than the Planck mass or the grand unification energy it appears that either there is some underlying connection or reason for these observations which is unknown and not described by the Standard Model or some unexplained and extremely precise finetuning of parameters however at present neither of these explanations is proven This is known as a hierarchy problem More broadly the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions should not have excessive finetunings or unduly delicate cancellations and should allow masses of particles such as the Higgs boson to be calculable The problem is in some ways unique to spin0 particles such as the Higgs boson which can give rise to issues related to quantum corrections that do not affect particles with spin A number of solutions have been proposed including supersymmetry conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such as braneworld models There are also issues of quantum triviality which suggests that it may not be possible to create a consistent quantum field theory involving elementary scalar particles Triviality constraints can be used to restrict or predict parameters such as the Higgs boson mass This can also lead to a predictable Higgs mass in asymptotic safety scenarios Properties Properties of the Higgs field In the Standard Model the Higgs field is a scalar tachyonic field scalar meaning it does not transform under Lorentz transformations and tachyonic meaning the field but not the particle has imaginary mass and in certain configurations must undergo symmetry breaking It consists of four components Two neutral ones and two charged component fields Both of the charged components and one of the neutral fields are Goldstone bosons which act as the longitudinal thirdpolarisation components of the massive W W and Z bosons The quantum of the remaining neutral component corresponds to and is theoretically realised as the massive Higgs boson This component can interact with fermions via Yukawa coupling to give them mass as well Mathematically the Higgs field has imaginary mass and is therefore a tachyonic field While tachyons particles that move faster than light are a purely hypothetical concept fields with imaginary mass have come to play an important role in modern physics Under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals there is no violation of causality Instead of fasterthanlight particles the imaginary mass creates an instability Any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic must spontaneously decay and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons This process is known as tachyon condensation and is now believed to be the explanation for how the Higgs mechanism itself arises in nature and therefore the reason behind electroweak symmetry breaking Although the notion of imaginary mass might seem troubling it is only the field and not the mass itself that is quantised Therefore the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute or anticommute and information and particles still do not propagate faster than light Tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist Once a tachyonic field such as the Higgs field reaches the minimum of the potential its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles such as the Higgs boson Properties of the Higgs boson Since the Higgs field is scalar the Higgs boson has no spin The Higgs boson is also its own antiparticle is CPeven and has zero electric and colour charge The Standard Model does not predict the mass of the Higgs boson If that mass is between 115 and 180 GeVc2 consistent with empirical observations of 125 GeVc2 then the Standard Model can be valid at energy scales all the way up to the Planck scale 1019 GeVc2 It should be the only particle in the Standard Model that remains massive even at high energies Many theorists expect new physics beyond the Standard Model to emerge at the TeVscale based on unsatisfactory properties of the Standard Model The highest possible mass scale allowed for the Higgs boson or some other electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism is 14 TeV beyond this point the Standard Model becomes inconsistent without such a mechanism because unitarity is violated in certain scattering processes It is also possible although experimentally difficult to estimate the mass of the Higgs boson indirectly In the Standard Model the Higgs boson has a number of indirect effects most notably Higgs loops result in tiny corrections to masses of the W and Z bosons Precision measurements of electroweak parameters such as the Fermi constant and masses of the W and Z bosons can be used to calculate constraints on the mass of the Higgs As of July 2011 the precision electroweak measurements tell us that the mass of the Higgs boson is likely to be less than about 161 GeVc2 at 95 confidence level These indirect constraints rely on the assumption that the Standard Model is correct It may still be possible to discover a Higgs boson above these masses if it is accompanied by other particles beyond those accommodated by the Standard Model The LHC cannot directly measure the Higgs bosons lifetime due to its extreme brevity It is predicted as 1561022 s based on the predicted decay width of 407103 GeV However it can be measured indirectly based upon comparing masses measured from quantum phenomena occurring in the on shell production pathways and in the much rarer off shell production pathways derived from Dalitz decay via a virtual photon H Using this technique the lifetime of the Higgs boson was tentatively measured in 2021 as 12 461022 s at sigma 32 1 in 1000 significance Production If Higgs particle theories are valid then a Higgs particle can be produced much like other particles that are studied in a particle collider This involves accelerating a large number of particles to extremely high energies and extremely close to the speed of light then allowing them to smash together Protons and lead ions the bare nuclei of lead atoms are used at the LHC In the extreme energies of these collisions the desired esoteric particles will occasionally be produced and this can be detected and studied any absence or difference from theoretical expectations can also be used to improve the theory The relevant particle theory in this case the Standard Model will determine the necessary kinds of collisions and detectors The Standard Model predicts that Higgs bosons could be formed in a number of ways although the probability of producing a Higgs boson in any collision is always expected to be very small for example only one Higgs boson per 10 billion collisions in the Large Hadron Collider The most common expected processes for Higgs boson production are Gluon fusion If the collided particles are hadrons such as the proton or antiproton as is the case in the LHC and Tevatron then it is most likely that two of the gluons binding the hadron together collide The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of virtual quarks Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass this process is more likely for heavy particles In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual top and bottom quarks the heaviest quarks This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely than any of the other processes Higgs Strahlung If an elementary fermion collides with an antifermion eg a quark with an antiquark or an electron with a positron the two can merge to form a virtual W or Z boson which if it carries sufficient energy can then emit a Higgs boson This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson and it was the second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron At the LHC this process is only the third largest because the LHC collides protons with protons making a quarkantiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron Higgs Strahlung is also known as associated production Weak boson fusion Another possibility when two antifermions collide is that the two exchange a virtual W or Z boson which emits a Higgs boson The colliding fermions do not need to be the same type So for example an up quark may exchange a Z boson with an antidown quark This process is the second most important for the production of Higgs particle at the LHC and LEP Top fusion The final process that is commonly considered is by far the least likely by two orders of magnitude This process involves two colliding gluons which each decay into a heavy quarkantiquark pair A quark and antiquark from each pair can then combine to form a Higgs particle Decay Quantum mechanics predicts that if it is possible for a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles then it will eventually do so This is also true for the Higgs boson The likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including the difference in mass the strength of the interactions etc Most of these factors are fixed by the Standard Model except for the mass of the Higgs boson itself For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeVc2 the SM predicts a mean life time of about 161022 s Since it interacts with all the massive elementary particles of the SM the Higgs boson has many different processes through which it can decay Each of these possible processes has its own probability expressed as the branching ratio the fraction of the total number decays that follows that process The SM predicts these branching ratios as a function of the Higgs mass see plot One way that the Higgs can decay is by splitting into a fermionantifermion pair As general rule the Higgs is more likely to decay into heavy fermions than light fermions because the mass of a fermion is proportional to the strength of its interaction with the Higgs By this logic the most common decay should be into a topantitop quark pair However such a decay would only be possible if the Higgs were heavier than 346 GeVc2 twice the mass of the top quark For a Higgs mass of 125 GeVc2 the SM predicts that the most common decay is into a bottomantibottom quark pair which happens 577 of the time The second most common fermion decay at that mass is a tauantitau pair which happens only about 63 of the time Another possibility is for the Higgs to split into a pair of massive gauge bosons The most likely possibility is for the Higgs to decay into a pair of W bosons the light blue line in the plot which happens about 215 of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeVc2 The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark and an antiquark or into a charged lepton and a neutrino The decays of W bosons into quarks are difficult to distinguish from the background and the decays into leptons cannot be fully reconstructed because neutrinos are impossible to detect in particle collision experiments A cleaner signal is given by decay into a pair of Zbosons which happens about 26 of the time for a Higgs with a mass of 125 GeVc2 if each of the bosons subsequently decays into a pair of easytodetect charged leptons electrons or muons Decay into massless gauge bosons ie gluons or photons is also possible but requires intermediate loop of virtual heavy quarks top or bottom or massive gauge bosons The most common such process is the decay into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual heavy quarks This process which is the reverse of the gluon fusion process mentioned above happens approximately 86 of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeVc2 Much rarer is the decay into a pair of photons mediated by a loop of W bosons or heavy quarks which happens only twice for every thousand decays However this process is very relevant for experimental searches for the Higgs boson because the energy and momentum of the photons can be measured very precisely giving an accurate reconstruction of the mass of the decaying particle In 2021 the extremely rare Dalitz decay was tentatively observed into two leptons electrons or muons and a photon via virtual photon decay This can happen in three ways Higgs to virtual photon to in which the virtual photon has very small but nonzero mass Higgs to Z boson to or Higgs to two leptons one of which emits a finalstate photon leading to ATLAS searched for evidence of the first of these H at low dilepton mass 30 GeVc2 where this process should dominate The observation is at sigma 32 1 in 1000 significance This decay path is important because it facilitates measuring the on and offshell mass of the Higgs boson allowing indirect measurement of decay time and the decay into two charged particles allows exploration of charge conjugation and charge parity CP violation Public discussion Naming Names used by physicists The name most strongly associated with the particle and field is the Higgs boson 168 and Higgs field For some time the particle was known by a combination of its PRL author names including at times Anderson for example the BroutEnglertHiggs particle the AndersonHiggs particle or the EnglertBroutHiggsGuralnikHagenKibble mechanism and these are still used at times Fuelled in part by the issue of recognition and a potential shared Nobel Prize the most appropriate name was still occasionally a topic of debate until 2013 Higgs himself preferred to call the particle either by an acronym of all those involved or the scalar boson or the socalled Higgs particle A considerable amount has been written on how Higgs name came to be exclusively used Two main explanations are offered The first is that Higgs undertook a step which was either unique clearer or more explicit in his paper in formally predicting and examining the particle Of the PRL papers authors only the paper by Higgs explicitly offered as a prediction that a massive particle would exist and calculated some of its properties 167 he was therefore the first to postulate the existence of a massive particle according to Nature Physicist and author Frank Close and physicistblogger Peter Woit both comment that the paper by GHK was also completed after Higgs and BroutEnglert were submitted to Physical Review Letters 167 and that Higgs alone had drawn attention to a predicted massive scalar boson while all others had focused on the massive vector bosons 154166175 In this way Higgs contribution also provided experimentalists with a crucial concrete target needed to test the theory However in Higgs view Brout and Englert did not explicitly mention the boson since its existence is plainly obvious in their work 6 while according to Guralnik the GHK paper was a complete analysis of the entire symmetry breaking mechanism whose mathematical rigour is absent from the other two papers and a massive particle may exist in some solutions 9 Higgs paper also provided an especially sharp statement of the challenge and its solution according to science historian David Kaiser The alternative explanation is that the name was popularised in the 1970s due to its use as a convenient shorthand or because of a mistake in citing Many accounts including Higgs own 7 credit the Higgs name to physicist Benjamin Lee Lee was a significant populariser of the theory in its early days and habitually attached the name Higgs as a convenient shorthand for its components from 1972 and in at least one instance from as early as 1966 Although Lee clarified in his footnotes that Higgs is an abbreviation for Higgs Kibble Guralnik Hagen Brout Englert his use of the term and perhaps also Steven Weinbergs mistaken cite of Higgs paper as the first in his seminal 1967 paper meant that by around 19751976 others had also begun to use the name Higgs exclusively as a shorthand In 2012 physicist Frank Wilczek who was credited for naming the elementary particle the axion over an alternative proposal Higglet by Weinberg endorsed the Higgs boson name stating History is complicated and wherever you draw the line there will be somebody just below it Nickname The Higgs boson is often referred to as the God particle in popular media outside the scientific community The nickname comes from the title of the 1993 book on the Higgs boson and particle physics The God Particle If the Universe Is the Answer What Is the Question by Physics Nobel Prize winner and Fermilab director Leon Lederman Lederman wrote it in the context of failing US government support for the Superconducting Super Collider a partially constructed titanic competitor to the Large Hadron Collider with planned collision energies of 2 20 TeV that was championed by Lederman since its 1983 inception and shut down in 1993 The book sought in part to promote awareness of the significance and need for such a project in the face of its possible loss of funding Lederman a leading researcher in the field writes that he wanted to title his book The Goddamn Particle If the Universe is the Answer What is the Question Ledermans editor decided that the title was too controversial and convinced him to change the title to The God Particle If the Universe is the Answer What is the Question While media use of this term may have contributed to wider awareness and interest many scientists feel the name is inappropriate since it is sensational hyperbole and misleads readers the particle also has nothing to do with any God leaves open numerous questions in fundamental physics and does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe Higgs an atheist was reported to be displeased and stated in a 2008 interview that he found it embarrassing because it was the kind of misuse which I think might offend some people The nickname has been satirised in mainstream media as well Science writer Ian Sample stated in his 2010 book on the search that the nickname is universally hated by physicists and perhaps the worst derided in the history of physics but that according to Lederman the publisher rejected all titles mentioning Higgs as unimaginative and too unknown Lederman begins with a review of the long human search for knowledge and explains that his tongueincheek title draws an analogy between the impact of the Higgs field on the fundamental symmetries at the Big Bang and the apparent chaos of structures particles forces and interactions that resulted and shaped our present universe with the biblical story of Babel in which the primordial single language of early Genesis was fragmented into many disparate languages and cultures Today we have the standard model which reduces all of reality to a dozen or so particles and four forces Its a hardwon simplicity and remarkably accurate But it is also incomplete and in fact internally inconsistent This boson is so central to the state of physics today so crucial to our final understanding of the structure of matter yet so elusive that I have given it a nickname the God Particle Why God Particle Two reasons One the publisher wouldnt let us call it the Goddamn Particle though that might be a more appropriate title given its villainous nature and the expense it is causing And two there is a connection of sorts to another book a much older one Lederman asks whether the Higgs boson was added just to perplex and confound those seeking knowledge of the universe and whether physicists will be confounded by it as recounted in that story or ultimately surmount the challenge and understand how beautiful is the universe God has made Other proposals A renaming competition by British newspaper The Guardian in 2009 resulted in their science correspondent choosing the name the champagne bottle boson as the best submission The bottom of a champagne bottle is in the shape of the Higgs potential and is often used as an illustration in physics lectures So its not an embarrassingly grandiose name it is memorable and it has some physics connection too The name Higgson was suggested as well in an opinion piece in the Institute of Physics online publication physicsworldcom Educational explanations and analogies There has been considerable public discussion of analogies and explanations for the Higgs particle and how the field creates mass including coverage of explanatory attempts in their own right and a competition in 1993 for the best popular explanation by thenUK Minister for Science Sir William Waldegrave and articles in newspapers worldwide An educational collaboration involving an LHC physicist and a High School Teachers at CERN educator suggests that dispersion of light responsible for the rainbow and dispersive prism is a useful analogy for the Higgs fields symmetry breaking and masscausing effect Matt Strassler uses electric fields as an analogy Some particles interact with the Higgs field while others dont Those particles that feel the Higgs field act as if they have mass Something similar happens in an electric field charged objects are pulled around and neutral objects can sail through unaffected So you can think of the Higgs search as an attempt to make waves in the Higgs field create Higgs bosons to prove its really there A similar explanation was offered by The Guardian The Higgs boson is essentially a ripple in a field said to have emerged at the birth of the universe and to span the cosmos to this day The particle is crucial however It is the smoking gun the evidence required to show the theory is right The Higgs fields effect on particles was famously described by physicist David Miller as akin to a room full of political party workers spread evenly throughout a room The crowd gravitates to and slows down famous people but does not slow down others He also drew attention to wellknown effects in solid state physics where an electrons effective mass can be much greater than usual in the presence of a crystal lattice Analogies based on drag effects including analogies of syrup or molasses are also well known but can be somewhat misleading since they may be understood incorrectly as saying that the Higgs field simply resists some particles motion but not others a simple resistive effect could also conflict with Newtons third law The Higgs boson is commonly misunderstood as responsible for mass rather than the Higgs field and as relating to most mass in the universe Recognition and awards There was considerable discussion prior to late 2013 of how to allocate the credit if the Higgs boson is proven made more pointed as a Nobel prize had been expected and the very wide basis of people entitled to consideration These include a range of theoreticians who made the Higgs mechanism theory possible the theoreticians of the 1964 PRL papers including Higgs himself the theoreticians who derived from these a working electroweak theory and the Standard Model itself and also the experimentalists at CERN and other institutions who made possible the proof of the Higgs field and boson in reality The Nobel prize has a limit of three persons to share an award and some possible winners are already prize holders for other work or are deceased the prize is only awarded to persons in their lifetime Existing prizes for works relating to the Higgs field boson or mechanism include Nobel Prize in Physics 1979 Glashow Salam and Weinberg

CMS collaborations at CERNs Large Hadron Collider Nobel Prize in Physics 2013 Peter Higgs and Franois Englert for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERNs Large Hadron Collider Englerts coresearcher Robert Brout had died in 2011 and the Nobel Prize is not ordinarily given posthumously Additionally Physical Review Letters 50year review 2008 recognised the 1964 PRL symmetry

several Indian media outlets reported on the supposed neglect of credit to Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose after whose work in the 1920s the class of particles bosons is named although physicists

    title: "String theory",
    originalContent:
      "In physics string theory is a theoretical framework in which the pointlike particles of particle physics are replaced by onedimensional objects called strings String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other On distance scales larger than the string scale a string looks just like an ordinary particle with its mass charge and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string In string theory one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics String theory has contributed a number of advances to mathematical physics which have been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics early universe cosmology nuclear physics and condensed matter physics and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics it is a candidate for a theory of everything a selfcontained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter Despite much work on these problems it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details String theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the strong nuclear force before being abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics Subsequently it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity The earliest version of string theory bosonic string theory incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons It later developed into superstring theory which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and the class of particles called fermions Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as Mtheory In late 1997 theorists discovered an important relationship called the antide Sitterconformal field theory correspondence AdSCFT correspondence which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory One of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances Another issue is that the theory is thought to describe an enormous landscape of possible universes which has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory These issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics and to question the value of continued research on string theory unification Fundamentals Overview In the 20th century two theoretical frameworks emerged for formulating the laws of physics The first is Albert Einsteins general theory of relativity a theory that explains the force of gravity and the structure of spacetime at the macrolevel The other is quantum mechanics a completely different formulation which uses known probability principles to describe physical phenomena at the microlevel By the late 1970s these two frameworks had proven to be sufficient to explain most of the observed features of the universe from elementary particles to atoms to the evolution of stars and the universe as a whole In spite of these successes there are still many problems that remain to be solved One of the deepest problems in modern physics is the problem of quantum gravity The general theory of relativity is formulated within the framework of classical physics whereas the other fundamental forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity In addition to the problem of developing a consistent theory of quantum gravity there are many other fundamental problems in the physics of atomic nuclei black holes and the early universe String theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to address these questions and many others The starting point for string theory is the idea that the pointlike particles of particle physics can also be modeled as onedimensional objects called strings String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other In a given version of string theory there is only one kind of string which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string and it can vibrate in different ways On distance scales larger than the string scale a string will look just like an ordinary particle consistent with nonstring models of elementary particles with its mass charge and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string String theorys application as a form of quantum gravity proposes a vibrational state responsible for the graviton a yet unproven quantum particle that is theorized to carry gravitational force One of the main developments of the past several decades in string theory was the discovery of certain dualities mathematical transformations that identify one physical theory with another Physicists studying string theory have discovered a number of these dualities between different versions of string theory and this has led to the conjecture that all consistent versions of string theory are subsumed in a single framework known as Mtheory Studies of string theory have also yielded a number of results on the nature of black holes and the gravitational interaction There are certain paradoxes that arise when one attempts to understand the quantum aspects of black holes and work on string theory has attempted to clarify these issues In late 1997 this line of work culminated in the discovery of the antide Sitterconformal field theory correspondence or AdSCFT This is a theoretical result that relates string theory to other physical theories which are better understood theoretically The AdSCFT correspondence has implications for the study of black holes and quantum gravity and it has been applied to other subjects including nuclear and condensed matter physics Since string theory incorporates all of the fundamental interactions including gravity many physicists hope that it will eventually be developed to the point where it fully describes our universe making it a theory of everything One of the goals of current research in string theory is to find a solution of the theory that reproduces the observed spectrum of elementary particles with a small cosmological constant containing dark matter and a plausible mechanism for cosmic inflation While there has been progress toward these goals it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of details One of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances The scattering of strings is most straightforwardly defined using the techniques of perturbation theory but it is not known in general how to define string theory nonperturbatively It is also not clear whether there is any principle by which string theory selects its vacuum state the physical state that determines the properties of our universe These problems have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to the unification of physics and question the value of continued research on these problems Strings The application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field which are extended in space and time is known as quantum field theory In particle physics quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields In quantum field theory one typically computes the probabilities of various physical events using the techniques of perturbation theory Developed by Richard Feynman and others in the first half of the twentieth century perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of pointlike particles and their interactions The starting point for string theory is the idea that the pointlike particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as onedimensional objects called strings The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory At the level of Feynman diagrams this means replacing the onedimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a twodimensional 2D surface representing the motion of a string Unlike in quantum field theory string theory does not have a full nonperturbative definition so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach In theories of particle physics based on string theory the characteristic length scale of strings is assumed to be on the order of the Planck length or 1035 meters the scale at which the effects of quantum gravity are believed to become significant On much larger length scales such as the scales visible in physics laboratories such objects would be indistinguishable from zerodimensional point particles and the vibrational state of the string would determine the type of particle One of the vibrational states of a string corresponds to the graviton a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force The original version of string theory was bosonic string theory but this version described only bosons a class of particles that transmit forces between the matter particles or fermions Bosonic string theory was eventually superseded by theories called superstring theories These theories describe both bosons and fermions and they incorporate a theoretical idea called supersymmetry In theories with supersymmetry each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion and vice versa There are several versions of superstring theory type I type IIA type IIB and two flavors of heterotic string theory SO32 and E8E8 The different theories allow different types of strings and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries For example the type I theory includes both open strings which are segments with endpoints and closed strings which form closed loops while types IIA IIB and heterotic include only closed strings Extra dimensions In everyday life there are three familiar dimensions 3D of space height width and length Einsteins general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions in general relativity space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a fourdimensional 4D spacetime In this framework the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of the geometry of spacetime In spite of the fact that the Universe is well described by 4D spacetime there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions In some cases by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions a theory becomes more mathematically tractable and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics Finally there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than 4D of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection String theories require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency In bosonic string theory spacetime is 26dimensional while in superstring theory it is 10dimensional and in Mtheory it is 11dimensional In order to describe real physical phenomena using string theory one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments Compactification is one way of modifying the number of dimensions in a physical theory In compactification some of the extra dimensions are assumed to close up on themselves to form circles In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance it appears to have only one dimension its length However as one approaches the hose one discovers that it contains a second dimension its circumference Thus an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions Compactification can be used to construct models in which spacetime is effectively fourdimensional However not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature In a viable model of particle physics the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a CalabiYau manifold A CalabiYau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be sixdimensional in applications to string theory It is named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and ShingTung Yau Another approach to reducing the number of dimensions is the socalled braneworld scenario In this approach physicists assume that the observable universe is a fourdimensional subspace of a higher dimensional space In such models the forcecarrying bosons of particle physics arise from open strings with endpoints attached to the fourdimensional subspace while gravity arises from closed strings propagating through the larger ambient space This idea plays an important role in attempts to develop models of realworld physics based on string theory and it provides a natural explanation for the weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces Dualities A notable fact about string theory is that the different versions of the theory all turn out to be related in highly nontrivial ways One of the relationships that can exist between different string theories is called Sduality This is a relationship that says that a collection of strongly interacting particles in one theory can in some cases be viewed as a collection of weakly interacting particles in a completely different theory Roughly speaking a collection of particles is said to be strongly interacting if they combine and decay often and weakly interacting if they do so infrequently Type I string theory turns out to be equivalent by Sduality to the SO32 heterotic string theory Similarly type IIB string theory is related to itself in a nontrivial way by Sduality Another relationship between different string theories is Tduality Here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension Tduality states that a string propagating around a circle of radius R is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius 1R in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description For example a string has momentum as it propagates around a circle and it can also wind around the circle one or more times The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the winding number If a string has momentum p and winding number n in one description it will have momentum n and winding number p in the dual description For example type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via Tduality and the two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by Tduality In general the term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way Two theories related by a duality need not be string theories For example MontonenOlive duality is an example of an Sduality relationship between quantum field theories The AdSCFT correspondence is an example of a duality that relates string theory to a quantum field theory If two theories are related by a duality it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation Put differently the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena Branes In string theory and other related theories a brane is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions For instance a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one It is also possible to consider higherdimensional branes In dimension p these are called pbranes The word brane comes from the word membrane which refers to a twodimensional brane Branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics They have mass and can have other attributes such as charge A pbrane sweeps out a p1dimensional volume in spacetime called its worldvolume Physicists often study fields analogous to the electromagnetic field which live on the worldvolume of a brane In string theory Dbranes are an important class of branes that arise when one considers open strings As an open string propagates through spacetime its endpoints are required to lie on a Dbrane The letter D in Dbrane refers to a certain mathematical condition on the system known as the Dirichlet boundary condition The study of Dbranes in string theory has led to important results such as the AdSCFT correspondence which has shed light on many problems in quantum field theory Branes are frequently studied from a purely mathematical point of view and they are described as objects of certain categories such as the derived category of coherent sheaves on a complex algebraic variety or the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold The connection between the physical notion of a brane and the mathematical notion of a category has led to important mathematical insights in the fields of algebraic and symplectic geometry and representation theory Mtheory Prior to 1995 theorists believed that there were five consistent versions of superstring theory type I type IIA type IIB and two versions of heterotic string theory This understanding changed in 1995 when Edward Witten suggested that the five theories were just special limiting cases of an elevendimensional theory called Mtheory Wittens conjecture was based on the work of a number of other physicists including Ashoke Sen Chris Hull Paul Townsend and Michael Duff His announcement led to a flurry of research activity now known as the second superstring revolution Unification of superstring theories In the 1970s many physicists became interested in supergravity theories which combine general relativity with supersymmetry Whereas general relativity makes sense in any number of dimensions supergravity places an upper limit on the number of dimensions In 1978 work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven In the same year Eugene Cremmer Bernard Julia and Jol Scherk of the cole Normale Suprieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions Initially many physicists hoped that by compactifying elevendimensional supergravity it might be possible to construct realistic models of our fourdimensional world The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature electromagnetism the strong and weak nuclear forces and gravity Interest in elevendimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise a phenomenon known as chirality Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions In the first superstring revolution in 1984 many physicists turned to string theory as a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity Unlike supergravity theory string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness In ordinary particle theories one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian In string theory the possibilities are much more constrained by the 1990s physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory Although there were only a handful of consistent superstring theories it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation However as physicists began to examine string theory more closely they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways They found that a system of strongly interacting strings can in some cases be viewed as a system of weakly interacting strings This phenomenon is known as Sduality It was studied by Ashoke Sen in the context of heterotic strings in four dimensions and by Chris Hull and Paul Townsend in the context of the type IIB theory Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by Tduality This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent At around the same time as many physicists were studying the properties of strings a small group of physicists were examining the possible applications of higher dimensional objects In 1987 Eric Bergshoeff Ergin Sezgin and Paul Townsend showed that elevendimensional supergravity includes twodimensional branes Intuitively these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the elevendimensional spacetime Shortly after this discovery Michael Duff Paul Howe Takeo Inami and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of elevendimensional supergravity with one of the dimensions curled up into a circle In this setting one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small then this membrane looks just like a string in tendimensional spacetime Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory Speaking at a string theory conference in 1995 Edward Witten made the surprising suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions Wittens announcement drew together all of the previous results on S and Tduality and the appearance of higherdimensional branes in string theory In the months following Wittens announcement hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming different parts of his proposal Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution Initially some physicists suggested that the new theory was a fundamental theory of membranes but Witten was skeptical of the role of membranes in the theory In a paper from 1996 Hoava and Witten wrote As it has been proposed that the elevendimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation we will noncommittally call it the Mtheory leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes In the absence of an understanding of the true meaning and structure of Mtheory Witten has suggested that the M should stand for magic mystery or membrane according to taste and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known Matrix theory In mathematics a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or other data In physics a matrix model is a particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves the notion of a matrix in an important way A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics One important example of a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks Willy Fischler Stephen Shenker and Leonard Susskind in 1997 This theory describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices In their original paper these authors showed among other things that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by elevendimensional supergravity These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to Mtheory The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of Mtheory and a tool for investigating the properties of Mtheory in a relatively simple setting The development of the matrix model formulation of Mtheory has led physicists to consider various connections between string theory and a branch of mathematics called noncommutative geometry This subject is a generalization of ordinary geometry in which mathematicians define new geometric notions using tools from noncommutative algebra In a paper from 1998 Alain Connes Michael R Douglas and Albert Schwarz showed that some aspects of matrix models and Mtheory are described by a noncommutative quantum field theory a special kind of physical theory in which spacetime is described mathematically using noncommutative geometry This established a link between matrix models and Mtheory on the one hand and noncommutative geometry on the other hand It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories Black holes In general relativity a black hole is defined as a region of spacetime in which the gravitational field is so strong that no particle or radiation can escape In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution black holes are thought to arise when massive stars undergo gravitational collapse and many galaxies are thought to contain supermassive black holes at their centers Black holes are also important for theoretical reasons as they present profound challenges for theorists attempting to understand the quantum aspects of gravity String theory has proved to be an important tool for investigating the theoretical properties of black holes because it provides a framework in which theorists can study their thermodynamics BekensteinHawking formula In the branch of physics called statistical mechanics entropy is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a physical system This concept was studied in the 1870s by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann who showed that the thermodynamic properties of a gas could be derived from the combined properties of its many constituent molecules Boltzmann argued that by averaging the behaviors of all the different molecules in a gas one can understand macroscopic properties such as volume temperature and pressure In addition this perspective led him to give a precise definition of entropy as the natural logarithm of the number of different states of the molecules also called microstates that give rise to the same macroscopic features In the twentieth century physicists began to apply the same concepts to black holes In most systems such as gases the entropy scales with the volume In the 1970s the physicist Jacob Bekenstein suggested that the entropy of a black hole is instead proportional to the surface area of its event horizon the boundary beyond which matter and radiation are lost to its gravitational attraction When combined with ideas of the physicist Stephen Hawking Bekensteins work yielded a precise formula for the entropy of a black hole The BekensteinHawking formula expresses the entropy S as S c 3 k A 4 G displaystyle Sfrac c3kA4hbar G where c is the speed of light k is the Boltzmann constant is the reduced Planck constant G is Newtons constant and A is the surface area of the event horizon Like any physical system a black hole has an entropy defined in terms of the number of different microstates that lead to the same macroscopic features The BekensteinHawking entropy formula gives the expected value of the entropy of a black hole but by the 1990s physicists still lacked a derivation of this formula by counting microstates in a theory of quantum gravity Finding such a derivation of this formula was considered an important test of the viability of any theory of quantum gravity such as string theory Derivation within string theory In a paper from 1996 Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa showed how to derive the BekensteinHawking formula for certain black holes in string theory Their calculation was based on the observation that Dbraneswhich look like fluctuating membranes when they are weakly interactingbecome dense massive objects with event horizons when the interactions are strong In other words a system of strongly interacting Dbranes in string theory is indistinguishable from a black hole Strominger and Vafa analyzed such Dbrane systems and calculated the number of different ways of placing Dbranes in spacetime so that their combined mass and charge is equal to a given mass and charge for the resulting black hole Their calculation reproduced the BekensteinHawking formula exactly including the factor of 14 Subsequent work by Strominger Vafa and others refined the original calculations and gave the precise values of the quantum corrections needed to describe very small black holes The black holes that Strominger and Vafa considered in their original work were quite different from real astrophysical black holes One difference was that Strominger and Vafa considered only extremal black holes in order to make the calculation tractable These are defined as black holes with the lowest possible mass compatible with a given charge Strominger and Vafa also restricted attention to black holes in fivedimensional spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry Although it was originally developed in this very particular and physically unrealistic context in string theory the entropy calculation of Strominger and Vafa has led to a qualitative understanding of how black hole entropy can be accounted for in any theory of quantum gravity Indeed in 1998 Strominger argued that the original result could be generalized to an arbitrary consistent theory of quantum gravity without relying on strings or supersymmetry In collaboration with several other authors in 2010 he showed that some results on black hole entropy could be extended to nonextremal astrophysical black holes AdSCFT correspondence One approach to formulating string theory and studying its properties is provided by the antide Sitterconformal field theory AdSCFT correspondence This is a theoretical result which implies that string theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string theory the AdSCFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective The AdSCFT correspondence was first proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997 Important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by Steven Gubser Igor Klebanov and Alexander Markovich Polyakov and by Edward Witten By 2010 Maldacenas article had over 7000 citations becoming the most highly cited article in the field of high energy physics Overview of the correspondence In the AdSCFT correspondence the geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain vacuum solution of Einsteins equation called antide Sitter space In very elementary terms antide Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points the metric is different from the notion of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry It is closely related to hyperbolic space which can be viewed as a disk as illustrated on the left This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior One can imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the state of the universe at a given time The resulting geometric object is threedimensional antide Sitter space It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the AdSCFT correspondence As with the hyperbolic plane antide Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface This construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space dimensions and one time dimension but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions Indeed hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can stack up copies of hyperbolic space to get higherdimensional models of antide Sitter space An important feature of antide Sitter space is its boundary which looks like a cylinder in the case of threedimensional antide Sitter space One property of this boundary is that within a small region on the surface around any given point it looks just like Minkowski space the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which spacetime is given by the boundary of antide Sitter space This observation is the starting point for AdSCFT correspondence which states that the boundary of antide Sitter space can be regarded as the spacetime for a quantum field theory The claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to a gravitational theory such as string theory in the bulk antide Sitter space in the sense that there is a dictionary for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other theory For example a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory In addition the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding Applications to quantum gravity The discovery of the AdSCFT correspondence was a major advance in physicists understanding of string theory and quantum gravity One reason for this is that the correspondence provides a formulation of string theory in terms of quantum field theory which is well understood by comparison Another reason is that it provides a general framework in which physicists can study and attempt to resolve the paradoxes of black holes In 1975 Stephen Hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon At first Hawkings result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information More precisely Hawkings calculation seemed to conflict with one of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the Schrdinger equation This property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution The apparent contradiction between Hawkings calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as the black hole information paradox The AdSCFT correspondence resolves the black hole information paradox at least to some extent because it shows how a black hole can evolve in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics in some contexts Indeed one can consider black holes in the context of the AdSCFT correspondence and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of antide Sitter space These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion so the black hole must also evolve in a unitary fashion respecting the principles of quantum mechanics In 2005 Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdSCFT correspondence and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information Applications to nuclear physics In addition to its applications to theoretical problems in quantum gravity the AdSCFT correspondence has been applied to a variety of problems in quantum field theory One physical system that has been studied using the AdSCFT correspondence is the quarkgluon plasma an exotic state of matter produced in particle accelerators This state of matter arises for brief instants when heavy ions such as gold or lead nuclei are collided at high energies Such collisions cause the quarks that make up atomic nuclei to deconfine at temperatures of approximately two trillion kelvin conditions similar to those present at around 1011 seconds after the Big Bang The physics of the quarkgluon plasma is governed by a theory called quantum chromodynamics but this theory is mathematically intractable in problems involving the quarkgluon plasma In an article appearing in 2005 m Thanh Sn and his collaborators showed that the AdSCFT correspondence could be used to understand some aspects of the quarkgluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory By applying the AdSCFT correspondence Sn and his collaborators were able to describe the quarkgluon plasma in terms of black holes in fivedimensional spacetime The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quarkgluon plasma the shear viscosity and volume density of entropy should be approximately equal to a certain universal constant In 2008 the predicted value of this ratio for the quarkgluon plasma was confirmed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory Applications to condensed matter physics The AdSCFT correspondence has also been used to study aspects of condensed matter physics Over the decades experimental condensed matter physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter including superconductors and superfluids These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques Some condensed matter theorists including Subir Sachdev hope that the AdSCFT correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior So far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of crisscrossing lasers These atoms initially behave as a superfluid but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state During the transition the atoms behave in an unusual way For example the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on the Planck constant the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics which does not enter into the description of the other phases This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole Phenomenology In addition to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest string theory provides a framework for constructing models of realworld physics that combine general relativity and particle physics Phenomenology is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas String phenomenology is the part of string theory that attempts to construct realistic or semirealistic models based on string theory Partly because of theoretical and mathematical difficulties and partly because of the extremely high energies needed to test these theories experimentally there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems Particle physics The currently accepted theory describing elementary particles and their interactions is known as the standard model of particle physics This theory provides a unified description of three of the fundamental forces of nature electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces Despite its remarkable success in explaining a wide range of physical phenomena the standard model cannot be a complete description of reality This is because the standard model fails to incorporate the force of gravity and because of problems such as the hierarchy problem and the inability to explain the structure of fermion masses or dark matter String theory has been used to construct a variety of models of particle physics going beyond the standard model Typically such models are based on the idea of compactification Starting with the ten or elevendimensional spacetime of string or Mtheory physicists postulate a shape for the extra dimensions By choosing this shape appropriately they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics together with additional undiscovered particles One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a sixdimensional CalabiYau manifold Such compactifications offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory Other similar methods can be used to construct realistic or semirealistic models of our fourdimensional world based on Mtheory Cosmology The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent largescale evolution Despite its success in explaining many observed features of the universe including galactic redshifts the relative abundance of light elements such as hydrogen and helium and the existence of a cosmic microwave background there are several questions that remain unanswered For example the standard Big Bang model does not explain why the universe appears to be the same in all directions why it appears flat on very large distance scales or why certain hypothesized particles such as magnetic monopoles are not observed in experiments Currently the leading candidate for a theory going beyond the Big Bang is the theory of cosmic inflation Developed by Alan Guth and others in the 1980s inflation postulates a period of extremely rapid accelerated expansion of the universe prior to the expansion described by the standard Big Bang theory The theory of cosmic inflation preserves the successes of the Big Bang while providing a natural explanation for some of the mysterious features of the universe The theory has also received striking support from observations of the cosmic microwave background the radiation that has filled the sky since around 380000 years after the Big Bang In the theory of inflation the rapid initial expansion of the universe is caused by a hypothetical particle called the inflaton The exact properties of this particle are not fixed by the theory but should ultimately be derived from a more fundamental theory such as string theory Indeed there have been a number of attempts to identify an inflaton within the spectrum of particles described by string theory and to study inflation using string theory While these approaches might eventually find support in observational data such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background the application of string theory to cosmology is still in its early stages Connections to mathematics In addition to influencing research in theoretical physics string theory has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics Like many developing ideas in theoretical physics string theory does not at present have a mathematically rigorous formulation in which all of its concepts can be defined precisely As a result physicists who study string theory are often guided by physical intuition to conjecture relationships between the seemingly different mathematical structures that are used to formalize different parts of the theory These conjectures are later proved by mathematicians and in this way string theory serves as a source of new ideas in pure mathematics Mirror symmetry After CalabiYau manifolds had entered physics as a way to compactify extra dimensions in string theory many physicists began studying these manifolds In the late 1980s several physicists noticed that given such a compactification of string theory it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding CalabiYau manifold Instead two different versions of string theory type IIA and type IIB can be compactified on completely different CalabiYau manifolds giving rise to the same physics In this situation the manifolds are called mirror manifolds and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry Regardless of whether CalabiYau compactifications of string theory provide a correct description of nature the existence of the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences The CalabiYau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in pure mathematics and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in enumerative geometry a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions Enumerative geometry studies a class of geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the vanishing of polynomials For example the Clebsch cubic illustrated on the right is an algebraic variety defined using a certain polynomial of degree three in four variables A celebrated result of nineteenthcentury mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface Generalizing this problem one can ask how many lines can be drawn on a quintic CalabiYau manifold such as the one illustrated above which is defined by a polynomial of degree five This problem was solved by the nineteenthcentury German mathematician Hermann Schubert who found that there are exactly 2875 such lines In 1986 geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves such as circles that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609250 By the year 1991 most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish The field was reinvigorated in May 1991 when physicists Philip Candelas Xenia de la Ossa Paul Green and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry could be used to translate difficult mathematical questions about one CalabiYau manifold into easier questions about its mirror In particular they used mirror symmetry to show that a sixdimensional CalabiYau manifold can contain exactly 317206375 curves of degree three In addition to counting degreethree curves Candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians Originally these results of Candelas were justified on physical grounds However mathematicians generally prefer rigorous proofs that do not require an appeal to physical intuition Inspired by physicists work on mirror symmetry mathematicians have therefore constructed their own arguments proving the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists intuition Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the homological mirror symmetry program of Maxim Kontsevich and the SYZ conjecture of Andrew Strominger ShingTung Yau and Eric Zaslow Monstrous moonshine Group theory is the branch of mathematics that studies the concept of symmetry For example one can consider a geometric shape such as an equilateral triangle There are various operations that one can perform on this triangle without changing its shape One can rotate it through 120 240 or 360 or one can reflect in any of the lines labeled S0 S1 or S2 in the picture Each of these operations is called a symmetry and the collection of these symmetries satisfies certain technical properties making it into what mathematicians call a group In this particular example the group is known as the dihedral group of order 6 because it has six elements A general group may describe finitely many or infinitely many symmetries if there are only finitely many symmetries it is called a finite group Mathematicians often strive for a classification or list of all mathematical objects of a given type It is generally believed that finite groups are too diverse to admit a useful classification A more modest but still challenging problem is to classify all finite simple groups These are finite groups that may be used as building blocks for constructing arbitrary finite groups in the same way that prime numbers can be used to construct arbitrary whole numbers by taking products One of the major achievements of contemporary group theory is the classification of finite simple groups a mathematical theorem that provides a list of all possible finite simple groups This classification theorem identifies several infinite families of groups as well as 26 additional groups which do not fit into any family The latter groups are called the sporadic groups and each one owes its existence to a remarkable combination of circumstances The largest sporadic group the socalled monster group has over 1053 elements more than a thousand times the number of atoms in the Earth A seemingly unrelated construction is the jfunction of number theory This object belongs to a special class of functions called modular functions whose graphs form a certain kind of repeating pattern Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics that seems very different from the theory of finite groups the two subjects turn out to be intimately related In the late 1970s mathematicians John McKay and John Thompson noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group namely the dimensions of its irreducible representations are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the jfunction namely the coefficients of its Fourier series This relationship was further developed by John Horton Conway and Simon Norton who called it monstrous moonshine because it seemed so far fetched In 1992 Richard Borcherds constructed a bridge between the theory of modular functions and finite groups and in the process explained the observations of McKay and Thompson Borcherds work used ideas from string theory in an essential way extending earlier results of Igor Frenkel James Lepowsky and Arne Meurman who had realized the monster group as the symmetries of a particular version of string theory In 1998 Borcherds was awarded the Fields medal for his work Since the 1990s the connection between string theory and moonshine has led to further results in mathematics and physics In 2010 physicists Tohru Eguchi Hirosi Ooguri and Yuji Tachikawa discovered connections between a different sporadic group the Mathieu group M24 and a certain version of string theory Miranda Cheng John Duncan and Jeffrey A Harvey proposed a generalization of this moonshine phenomenon called umbral moonshine and their conjecture was proved mathematically by Duncan Michael Griffin and Ken Ono Witten has also speculated that the version of string theory appearing in monstrous moonshine might be related to a certain simplified model of gravity in three spacetime dimensions History Early results Some of the structures reintroduced by string theory arose for the first time much earlier as part of the program of classical unification started by Albert Einstein The first person to add a fifth dimension to a theory of gravity was Gunnar Nordstrm in 1914 who noted that gravity in five dimensions describes both gravity and electromagnetism in four Nordstrm attempted to unify electromagnetism with his theory of gravitation which was however superseded by Einsteins general relativity in 1919 Thereafter German mathematician Theodor Kaluza combined the fifth dimension with general relativity and only Kaluza is usually credited with the idea In 1926 the Swedish physicist Oskar Klein gave a physical interpretation of the unobservable extra dimensionit is wrapped into a small circle Einstein introduced a nonsymmetric metric tensor while much later Brans and Dicke added a scalar component to gravity These ideas would be revived within string theory where they are demanded by consistency conditions String theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a never completely successful theory of hadrons the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that feel the strong interaction In the 1960s Geoffrey Chew and Steven Frautschi discovered that the mesons make families called Regge trajectories with masses related to spins in a way that was later understood by Yoichiro Nambu Holger Bech Nielsen and Leonard Susskind to be the relationship expected from rotating strings Chew advocated making a theory for the interactions of these trajectories that did not presume that they were composed of any fundamental particles but would construct their interactions from selfconsistency conditions on the Smatrix The Smatrix approach was started by Werner Heisenberg in the 1940s as a way of constructing a theory that did not rely on the local notions of space and time which Heisenberg believed break down at the nuclear scale While the scale was off by many orders of magnitude the approach he advocated was ideally suited for a theory of quantum gravity Working with experimental data R Dolen D Horn and C Schmid developed some sum rules for hadron exchange When a particle and antiparticle scatter virtual particles can be exchanged in two qualitatively different ways In the schannel the two particles annihilate to make temporary intermediate states that fall apart into the final state particles In the tchannel the particles exchange intermediate states by emission and absorption In field theory the two contributions add together one giving a continuous background contribution the other giving peaks at certain energies In the data it was clear that the peaks were stealing from the backgroundthe authors interpreted this as saying that the tchannel contribution was dual to the schannel one meaning both described the whole amplitude and included the other The result was widely advertised by Murray GellMann leading Gabriele Veneziano to construct a scattering amplitude that had the property of DolenHornSchmid duality later renamed worldsheet duality The amplitude needed poles where the particles appear on straightline trajectories and there is a special mathematical function whose poles are evenly spaced on half the real linethe gamma functionwhich was widely used in Regge theory By manipulating combinations of gamma functions Veneziano was able to find a consistent scattering amplitude with poles on straight lines with mostly positive residues which obeyed duality and had the appropriate Regge scaling at high energy The amplitude could fit nearbeam scattering data as well as other Regge type fits and had a suggestive integral representation that could be used for generalization Over the next years hundreds of physicists worked to complete the bootstrap program for this model with many surprises Veneziano himself discovered that for the scattering amplitude to describe the scattering of a particle that appears in the theory an obvious selfconsistency condition the lightest particle must be a tachyon Miguel Virasoro and Joel Shapiro found a different amplitude now understood to be that of closed strings while Ziro Koba and Holger Nielsen generalized Venezianos integral representation to multiparticle scattering Veneziano and Sergio Fubini introduced an operator formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes that was a forerunner of worldsheet conformal theory while Virasoro understood how to remove the poles with wrongsign residues using a constraint on the states Claud Lovelace calculated a loop amplitude and noted that there is an inconsistency unless the dimension of the theory is 26 Charles Thorn Peter Goddard and Richard Brower went on to prove that there are no wrongsign propagating states in dimensions less than or equal to 26 In 19691970 Yoichiro Nambu Holger Bech Nielsen and Leonard Susskind recognized that the theory could be given a description in space and time in terms of strings The scattering amplitudes were derived systematically from the action principle by Peter Goddard Jeffrey Goldstone Claudio Rebbi and Charles Thorn giving a spacetime picture to the vertex operators introduced by Veneziano and Fubini and a geometrical interpretation to the Virasoro conditions In 1971 Pierre Ramond added fermions to the model which led him to formulate a twodimensional supersymmetry to cancel the wrongsign states John Schwarz and Andr Neveu added another sector to the fermi theory a short time later In the fermion theories the critical dimension was 10 Stanley Mandelstam formulated a world sheet conformal theory for both the bose and fermi case giving a twodimensional field theoretic pathintegral to generate the operator formalism Michio Kaku and Keiji Kikkawa gave a different formulation of the bosonic string as a string field theory with infinitely many particle types and with fields taking values not on points but on loops and curves In 1974 Tamiaki Yoneya discovered that all the known string theories included a massless spintwo particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a graviton John Schwarz and Jol Scherk came to the same conclusion and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity not a theory of hadrons They reintroduced KaluzaKlein theory as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions At the same time quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the dustbin of history String theory eventually made it out of the dustbin but for the following decade all work on the theory was completely ignored Still the theory continued to develop at a steady pace thanks to the work of a handful of devotees Ferdinando Gliozzi Jol Scherk and David Olive realized in 1977 that the original Ramond and Neveu Schwarzstrings were separately inconsistent and needed to be combined The resulting theory did not have a tachyon and was proven to have spacetime supersymmetry by John Schwarz and Michael Green in 1984 The same year Alexander Polyakov gave the theory a modern path integral formulation and went on to develop conformal field theory extensively In 1979 Daniel Friedan showed that the equations of motions of string theory which are generalizations of the Einstein equations of general relativity emerge from the renormalization group equations for the twodimensional field theory Schwarz and Green discovered Tduality and constructed two superstring theoriesIIA and IIB related by Tduality and type I theories with open strings The consistency conditions had been so strong that the entire theory was nearly uniquely determined with only a few discrete choices First superstring revolution In the early 1980s Edward Witten discovered that most theories of quantum gravity could not accommodate chiral fermions like the neutrino This led him in collaboration with Luis lvarezGaum to study violations of the conservation laws in gravity theories with anomalies concluding that type I string theories were inconsistent Green and Schwarz discovered a contribution to the anomaly that Witten and AlvarezGaum had missed which restricted the gauge group of the type I string theory to be SO32 In coming to understand this calculation Edward Witten became convinced that string theory was truly a consistent theory of gravity and he became a highprofile advocate Following Wittens lead between 1984 and 1986 hundreds of physicists started to work in this field and this is sometimes called the first superstring revolution During this period David Gross Jeffrey Harvey Emil Martinec and Ryan Rohm discovered heterotic strings The gauge group of these closed strings was two copies of E8 and either copy could easily and naturally include the standard model Philip Candelas Gary Horowitz Andrew Strominger and Edward Witten found that the CalabiYau manifolds are the compactifications that preserve a realistic amount of supersymmetry while Lance Dixon and others worked out the physical properties of orbifolds distinctive geometrical singularities allowed in string theory Cumrun Vafa generalized Tduality from circles to arbitrary manifolds creating the mathematical field of mirror symmetry Daniel Friedan Emil Martinec and Stephen Shenker further developed the covariant quantization of the superstring using conformal field theory techniques David Gross and Vipul Periwal discovered that string perturbation theory was divergent Stephen Shenker showed it diverged much faster than in field theory suggesting that new nonperturbative objects were missing In the 1990s Joseph Polchinski discovered that the theory requires higherdimensional objects called Dbranes and identified these with the blackhole solutions of supergravity These were understood to be the new objects suggested by the perturbative divergences and they opened up a new field with rich mathematical structure It quickly became clear that Dbranes and other pbranes not just strings formed the matter content of the string theories and the physical interpretation of the strings and branes was revealedthey are a type of black hole Leonard Susskind had incorporated the holographic principle of Gerardus t Hooft into string theory identifying the long highly excited string states with ordinary thermal black hole states As suggested by t Hooft the fluctuations of the black hole horizon the worldsheet or worldvolume theory describes not only the degrees of freedom of the black hole but all nearby objects too Second superstring revolution In 1995 at the annual conference of string theorists at the University of Southern California USC Edward Witten gave a speech on string theory that in essence united the five string theories that existed at the time and giving birth to a new 11dimensional theory called Mtheory Mtheory was also foreshadowed in the work of Paul Townsend at approximately the same time The flurry of activity that began at this time is sometimes called the second superstring revolution During this period Tom Banks Willy Fischler Stephen Shenker and Leonard Susskind formulated matrix theory a full holographic description of Mtheory using IIA D0 branes This was the first definition of string theory that was fully nonperturbative and a concrete mathematical realization of the holographic principle It is an example of a gaugegravity duality and is now understood to be a special case of the AdSCFT correspondence Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa calculated the entropy of certain configurations of Dbranes and found agreement with the semiclassical answer for extreme charged black holes Petr Hoava and Witten found the elevendimensional formulation of the heterotic string theories showing that orbifolds solve the chirality problem Witten noted that the effective description of the physics of Dbranes at low energies is by a supersymmetric gauge theory and found geometrical interpretations of mathematical structures in gauge theory that he and Nathan Seiberg had earlier discovered in terms of the location of the branes In 1997 Juan Maldacena noted that the low energy excitations of a theory near a black hole consist of objects close to the horizon which for extreme charged black holes looks like an antide Sitter space He noted that in this limit the gauge theory describes the string excitations near the branes So he hypothesized that string theory on a nearhorizon extremecharged blackhole geometry an antide Sitter space times a sphere with flux is equally well described by the lowenergy limiting gauge theory the N 4 supersymmetric YangMills theory This hypothesis which is called the AdSCFT correspondence was further developed by Steven Gubser Igor Klebanov and Alexander Polyakov and by Edward Witten and it is now wellaccepted It is a concrete realization of the holographic principle which has farreaching implications for black holes locality and information in physics as well as the nature of the gravitational interaction Through this relationship string theory has been shown to be related to gauge theories like quantum chromodynamics and this has led to a more quantitative understanding of the behavior of hadrons bringing string theory back to its roots Criticism Number of solutions To construct models of particle physics based on string theory physicists typically begin by specifying a shape for the extra dimensions of spacetime Each of these different shapes corresponds to a different possible universe or vacuum state with a different collection of particles and forces String theory as it is currently understood has an enormous number of vacuum states typically estimated to be around 10500 and these might be sufficiently diverse to accommodate almost any phenomenon that might be observed at low energies Many critics of string theory have expressed concerns about the large number of possible universes described by string theory In his book Not Even Wrong Peter Woit a lecturer in the mathematics department at Columbia University has argued that the large number of different physical scenarios renders string theory vacuous as a framework for constructing models of particle physics According to Woit The possible existence of say 10500 consistent different vacuum states for superstring theory probably destroys the hope of using the theory to predict anything If one picks among this large set just those states whose properties agree with present experimental observations it is likely there still will be such a large number of these that one can get just about whatever value one wants for the results of any new observation Some physicists believe this large number of solutions is actually a virtue because it may allow a natural anthropic explanation of the observed values of physical constants in particular the small value of the cosmological constant The anthropic principle is the idea that some of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics are not fixed by any fundamental principle but must be compatible with the evolution of intelligent life In 1987 Steven Weinberg published an article in which he argued that the cosmological constant could not have been too large or else galaxies and intelligent life would not have been able to develop Weinberg suggested that there might be a huge number of possible consistent universes each with a different value of the cosmological constant and observations indicate a small value of the cosmological constant only because humans happen to live in a universe that has allowed intelligent life and hence observers to exist String theorist Leonard Susskind has argued that string theory provides a natural anthropic explanation of the small value of the cosmological constant According to Susskind the different vacuum states of string theory might be realized as different universes within a larger multiverse The fact that the observed universe has a small cosmological constant is just a tautological consequence of the fact that a small value is required for life to exist Many prominent theorists and critics have disagreed with Susskinds conclusions According to Woit in this case anthropic reasoning is nothing more than an excuse for failure Speculative scientific ideas fail not just when they make incorrect predictions but also when they turn out to be vacuous and incapable of predicting anything Compatibility with dark energy It remains unknown whether string theory is compatible with a metastable positive cosmological constant Some putative examples of such solutions do exist such as the model described by Kachru et al in 2003 In 2018 a group of four physicists advanced a controversial conjecture which would imply that no such universe exists This is contrary to some popular models of dark energy such as CDM which requires a positive vacuum energy However string theory is likely compatible with certain types of quintessence where dark energy is caused by a new field with exotic properties Background independence One of the fundamental properties of Einsteins general theory of relativity is that it is background independent meaning that the formulation of the theory does not in any way privilege a particular spacetime geometry One of the main criticisms of string theory from early on is that it is not manifestly backgroundindependent In string theory one must typically specify a fixed reference geometry for spacetime and all other possible geometries are described as perturbations of this fixed one In his book The Trouble With Physics physicist Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics claims that this is the principal weakness of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity saying that string theory has failed to incorporate this important insight from general relativity Others have disagreed with Smolins characterization of string theory In a review of Smolins book string theorist Joseph Polchinski writes Smolin is mistaking an aspect of the mathematical language being used for one of the physics being described New physical theories are often discovered using a mathematical language that is not the most suitable for them In string theory it has always been clear that the physics is backgroundindependent even if the language being used is not and the search for a more suitable language continues Indeed as Smolin belatedly notes AdSCFT provides a solution to this problem one that is unexpected and powerful Polchinski notes that an important open problem in quantum gravity is to develop holographic descriptions of gravity which do not require the gravitational field to be asymptotically antide Sitter Smolin has responded by saying that the AdSCFT correspondence as it is currently understood may not be strong enough to resolve all concerns about background independence Sociology of science Since the superstring revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s string theory has been one of the dominant paradigms of high energy theoretical physics Some string theorists have expressed the view that there does not exist an equally successful alternative theory addressing the deep questions of fundamental physics In an interview from 1987 Nobel laureate David Gross made the following controversial comments about the reasons for the popularity of string theory The most important reason is that there are no other good ideas around Thats what gets most people into it When people started to get interested in string theory they didnt know anything about it In fact the first reaction of most people is that the theory is extremely ugly and unpleasant at least that was the case a few years ago when the understanding of string theory was much less developed It was difficult for people to learn about it and to be turned on So I think the real reason why people have got attracted by it is because there is no other game in town All other approaches of constructing grand unified theories which were more conservative to begin with and only gradually became more and more radical have failed and this game hasnt failed yet Several other highprofile theorists and commentators have expressed similar views suggesting that there are no viable alternatives to string theory Many critics of string theory have commented on this state of affairs In his book criticizing string theory Peter Woit views the status of string theory research as unhealthy and detrimental to the future of fundamental physics He argues that the extreme popularity of string theory among theoretical physicists is partly a consequence of the financial structure of academia and the fierce competition for scarce resources In his book The Road to Reality mathematical physicist Roger Penrose expresses similar views stating The often frantic competitiveness that this ease of communication engenders leads to bandwagon effects where researchers fear to be left behind if they do not join in Penrose also claims that the technical difficulty of modern physics forces young scientists to rely on the preferences of established researchers rather than forging new paths of their own Lee Smolin expresses a slightly different position in his critique claiming that string theory grew out of a tradition of particle physics which discourages speculation about the foundations of physics while his preferred approach loop quantum gravity encourages more radical thinking According to Smolin String theory is a powerful wellmotivated idea and deserves much of the work that has been devoted to it If it has so far failed the principal reason is that its intrinsic flaws are closely tied to its strengthsand of course the story is unfinished since string theory may well turn out to be part of the truth The real question is not why we have expended so much energy on string theory but why we havent expended nearly enough on alternative approaches Smolin goes on to offer a number of prescriptions for how scientists might encourage a greater diversity of approaches to quantum gravity research Notes References Bibliography Further reading Popular science

    title: "Cybersecurity",
    originalContent:
      "Computer security also cybersecurity digital security or information technology IT security is the protection of computer software systems and networks from threats that can lead to unauthorized information disclosure theft or damage to hardware software or data as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide The significance of the field stems from the expanded reliance on computer systems the Internet and wireless network standards Its importance is further amplified by the growth of smart devices including smartphones televisions and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things IoT Cybersecurity has emerged as one of the most significant new challenges facing the contemporary world due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they support Security is particularly crucial for systems that govern largescale systems with farreaching physical effects such as power distribution elections and finance Although many aspects of computer security involve digital security such as electronic passwords and encryption physical security measures such as metal locks are still used to prevent unauthorized tampering IT security is not a perfect subset of information security therefore does not completely align into the security convergence schema Vulnerabilities and attacks A vulnerability refers to a flaw in the structure execution functioning or internal oversight of a computer or system that compromises its security Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE database An exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists Actors maliciously seeking vulnerabilities are known as threats Vulnerabilities can be researched reverseengineered hunted or exploited using automated tools or customized scripts Various people or parties are vulnerable to cyber attacks however different groups are likely to experience different types of attacks more than others In April 2023 the United Kingdom Department for Science Innovation Technology released a report on cyber attacks over the last 12 months They surveyed 2263 UK businesses 1174 UK registered charities and 554 education institutions The research found that 32 of businesses and 24 of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months These figures were much higher for medium businesses 59 large businesses 69 and highincome charities with 500000 or more in annual income 56 Yet although medium or large businesses are more often the victims since larger companies have generally improved their security over the last decade small and midsize businesses SMBs have also become increasingly vulnerable as they often do not have advanced tools to defend the business SMBs are most likely to be affected by malware ransomware phishing maninthemiddle attacks and Denialof Service DoS Attacks Normal internet users are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyberattacks These are where attackers indiscriminately target as many devices services or users as possible They do this using techniques that take advantage of the openness of the Internet These strategies mostly include phishing ransomware water holing and scanning To secure a computer system it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it and these threats can typically be classified into one of the following categories Backdoor A backdoor in a computer system a cryptosystem or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls These weaknesses may exist for many reasons including original design or poor configuration Due to the nature of backdoors they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals Backdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons Criminals often use malware to install backdoors giving them remote administrative access to a system Once they have access cybercriminals can modify files steal personal information install unwanted software and even take control of the entire computer Backdoors can be very hard to detect and are usually discovered by someone who has access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer Denialofservice attack Denialofservice attacks DoS are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users Attackers can deny service to individual victims such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule many forms of distributed denialofservice DDoS attacks are possible where the attack comes from a large number of points In this case defending against these attacks is much more difficult Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques including distributed reflective denialofservice DRDoS where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim With such attacks the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves To understand why attackers may carry out these attacks see the attacker motivation section Physical access attacks A directaccess attack is when an unauthorized user an attacker gains physical access to a computer most likely to directly copy data from it or steal information Attackers may also compromise security by making operating system modifications installing software worms keyloggers covert listening devices or using wireless microphones Even when the system is protected by standard security measures these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a CDROM or other bootable media Disk encryption and the Trusted Platform Module standard are designed to prevent these attacks Direct service attackers are related in concept to direct memory attacks which allow an attacker to gain direct access to a computers memory The attacks take advantage of a feature of modern computers that allows certain devices such as external hard drives graphics cards or network cards to access the computers memory directly Eavesdropping Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation communication usually between hosts on a network It typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague which when listened to by an attacker could be exploited Data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various methods Unlike malware directaccess attacks or other forms of cyber attacks eavesdropping attacks are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of networks or devices making them difficult to notice In fact the attacker does not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all The attacker can insert the software onto a compromised device perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined time Using a virtual private network VPN which encrypts data between two points is one of the most common forms of protection against eavesdropping Using the best form of encryption possible for wireless networks is best practice as well as using HTTPS instead of an unencrypted HTTP Programs such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers Even machines that operate as a closed system ie with no contact with the outside world can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks Malware Malicious software malware is any software code or computer program intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users Once present on a computer it can leak sensitive details such as personal information business information and passwords can give control of the system to the attacker and can corrupt or delete data permanently Another type of malware is ransomware which is when malware installs itself onto a victims machine encrypts their files and then turns around and demands a ransom usually in Bitcoin to return that data to the user Types of malware include some of the following Viruses are a specific type of malware and are normally a malicious code that hijacks software with the intention to do damage and spread copies of itself Copies are made with the aim to spread to other programs on a computer Worms are similar to viruses however viruses can only function when a user runs opens a compromised program Worms are selfreplicating malware that spread between programs apps and devices without the need for human interaction Trojan horses are programs that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to trick users into installing them Once installed a RAT remote access trojan can create a secret backdoor on the affected device to cause damage Spyware is a type of malware that secretly gathers information from an infected computer and transmits the sensitive information back to the attacker One of the most common forms of spyware are keyloggers which record all of a users keyboard inputskeystrokes to allow hackers to harvest usernames passwords bank account and credit card numbers Scareware as the name suggests is a form of malware which uses social engineering manipulation to scare shock trigger anxiety or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate users into buying or installing unwanted software These attacks often begin with a sudden popup with an urgent message usually warning the user that theyve broken the law or their device has a virus Maninthemiddle attacks Maninthemiddle attacks MITM involve a malicious attacker trying to intercept surveil or modify communications between two parties by spoofing one or both partys identities and injecting themselves inbetween Types of MITM attacks include IP address spoofing is where the attacker hijacks routing protocols to reroute the targets traffic to a vulnerable network node for traffic interception or injection Message spoofing via email SMS or OTT messaging is where the attacker spoofs the identity or carrier service while the target is using messaging protocols like email SMS or OTT IPbased messaging apps The attacker can then monitor conversations launch social attacks or trigger zerodayvulnerabilities to allow for further attacks WiFi SSID spoofing is where the attacker simulates a WIFI base station SSID to capture and modify internet traffic and transactions The attacker can also use local network addressing and reduced network defenses to penetrate the targets firewall by breaching known vulnerabilities Sometimes known as a Pineapple attack thanks to a popular device See also Malicious association DNS spoofing is where attackers hijack domain name assignments to redirect traffic to systems under the attackers control in order to surveil traffic or launch other attacks SSL hijacking typically coupled with another medialevel MITM attack is where the attacker spoofs the SSL authentication and encryption protocol by way of Certificate Authority injection in order to decrypt surveil and modify traffic See also TLS interception Multivector polymorphic attacks Surfacing in 2017 a new class of multivector polymorphic cyber threats combine several types of attacks and change form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread Multivector polymorphic attacks as the name describes are both multivectored and polymorphic Firstly they are a singular attack that involves multiple methods of attack In this sense they are multivectored ie the attack can use multiple means of propagation such as via the Web email and applications However they are also multistaged meaning that they can infiltrate networks and move laterally inside the network The attacks can be polymorphic meaning that the cyberattacks used such as viruses worms or trojans constantly change morph making it nearly impossible to detect them using signaturebased defences Phishing Phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames passwords and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing instant messaging text message or on a phone call They often direct users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one The fake website often asks for personal information such as login details and passwords This information can then be used to gain access to the individuals real account on the real website Preying on a victims trust phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering Attackers can use creative ways to gain access to real accounts A common scam is for attackers to send fake electronic invoices to individuals showing that they recently purchased music apps or others and instructing them to click on a link if the purchases were not authorized A more strategic type of phishing is spearphishing which leverages personal or organizationspecific details to make the attacker appear like a trusted source Spearphishing attacks target specific individuals rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts Privilege escalation Privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to without authorization elevate their privileges or access level For example a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system The severity of attacks can range from attacks simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amounts of data Privilege escalation usually starts with social engineering techniques often phishing Privilege escalation can be separated into two strategies horizontal and vertical privilege escalation Horizontal escalation or account takeover is where an attacker gains access to a normal user account that has relatively lowlevel privileges This may be through stealing the users username and password Once they have access they have gained a foothold and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of users at this same lower level gaining access to information of this similar privilege Vertical escalation however targets people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power such as an employee in IT with a higher privilege Using this privileged account will then enable the attacker to invade other accounts Sidechannel attack Any computational system affects its environment in some form This effect it has on its environment can range from electromagnetic radiation to residual effect on RAM cells which as a consequence make a Cold boot attack possible to hardware implementation faults that allow for access or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible In Sidechannel attack scenarios the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess its internal state and as a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure The target information in a side channel can be challenging to detect due to its low amplitude when combined with other signals Social engineering Social engineering in the context of computer security aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords card numbers etc or grant physical access by for example impersonating a senior executive bank a contractor or a customer This generally involves exploiting peoples trust and relying on their cognitive biases A common scam involves emails sent to accounting and finance department personnel impersonating their CEO and urgently requesting some action One of the main techniques of social engineering are phishing attacks In early 2016 the FBI reported that such business email compromise BEC scams had cost US businesses more than 2 billion in about two years In May 2016 the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the teams president Peter Feigin resulting in the handover of all the teams employees 2015 W2 tax forms Spoofing Spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data such as an IP address or username in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain Spoofing is closely related to phishing There are several types of spoofing including Email spoofing is where an attacker forges the sending From or source address of an email IP address spoofing where an attacker alters the source IP address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system MAC spoofing where an attacker modifies the Media Access Control MAC address of their network interface controller to obscure their identity or to pose as another Biometric spoofing where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user Address Resolution Protocol ARP spoofing where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a local area network to associate their Media Access Control address with a different hosts IP address This causes data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended host In 2018 the cybersecurity firm Trellix published research on the lifethreatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry Tampering Tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data It is an intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system components of systems its intended behavior or data Socalled Evil Maid attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples HTML smuggling HTML smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular HTML or web page HTML files can carry payloads concealed as benign inert data in order to defeat content filters These payloads can be reconstructed on the other side of the filter When a target user opens the HTML the malicious code is activated the web browser then decodes the script which then unleashes the malware onto the targets device Information security practices Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization Information security culture is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kinds Andersson and Reimers 2014 found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organizations information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes Indeed the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2020 which examined 3950 security breaches discovered 30 of cybersecurity incidents involved internal actors within a company Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously In Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change authors commented Its a neverending process a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance To manage the information security culture five steps should be taken preevaluation strategic planning operative planning implementation and postevaluation Preevaluation To identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policies Strategic planning To come up with a better awareness program clear targets need to be set Assembling a team of skilled professionals is helpful to achieve it Operative planning A good security culture can be established based on internal communication management buyin security awareness and a training program Implementation Four stages should be used to implement the information security culture They are Commitment of the management Communication with organizational members Courses for all organizational members Commitment of the employees Postevaluation To assess the success of the planning and implementation and to identify unresolved areas of concern Computer protection countermeasures In computer security a countermeasure is an action device procedure or technique that reduces a threat a vulnerability or an attack by eliminating or preventing it by minimizing the harm it can cause or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken Some common countermeasures are listed in the following sections Security by design Security by design or alternately secure by design means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure In this case security is considered a main feature The UK governments National Cyber Security Centre separates secure cyber design principles into five sections Before a secure system is created or updated companies should ensure they understand the fundamentals and the context around the system they are trying to create and identify any weaknesses in the system Companies should design and centre their security around techniques and defences which make attacking their data or systems inherently more challenging for attackers Companies should ensure that their core services that rely on technology are protected so that the systems are essentially never down Although systems can be created which are safe against a multitude of attacks that does not mean that attacks will not be attempted Despite ones security all companies systems should aim to be able to detect and spot attacks as soon as they occur to ensure the most effective response to them Companies should create secure systems designed so that any attack that is successful has minimal severity These design principles of security by design can include some of the following techniques The principle of least privilege where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function That way even if an attacker gains access to that part they only have limited access to the whole system Automated theorem proving to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems Code reviews and unit testing approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible Defense in depth where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds Default secure settings and design to fail secure rather than fail insecure see failsafe for the equivalent in safety engineering Ideally a secure system should require a deliberate conscious knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure Audit trails track system activity so that when a security breach occurs the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined Storing audit trails remotely where they can only be appended to can keep intruders from covering their tracks Full disclosure of all vulnerabilities to ensure that the window of vulnerability is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered Security architecture Security architecture can be defined as the practice of designing computer systems to achieve security goals These goals have overlap with the principles of security by design explored above including to make initial compromise of the system difficult and to limit the impact of any compromise In practice the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system and that new changes are safe and meet the security requirements of the organization Similarly Techopedia defines security architecture as a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment It also specifies when and where to apply security controls The design process is generally reproducible The key attributes of security architecture are the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other determination of controls based on risk assessment good practices finances and legal matters the standardization of controls Practicing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business IT and security concerns in an organization Security measures A state of computer security is the conceptual ideal attained by the use of three processes threat prevention detection and response These processes are based on various policies and system components which include the following Limiting the access of individuals using user account access controls and using cryptography can protect systems files and data respectively Firewalls are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can if properly configured shield access to internal network services and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering Firewalls can be both hardware and softwarebased Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network Intrusion Detection System IDS products are designed to detect network attacks inprogress and assist in postattack forensics while audit trails and logs serve a similar function for individual systems Response is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of legal authorities counterattacks and the like In some special cases the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected Cyber security awareness training to cope with cyber threats and attacks Forward web proxy solutions can prevent the client to visit malicious web pages and inspect the content before downloading to the client machines Today computer security consists mainly of preventive measures like firewalls or an exit procedure A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network such as the Internet They can be implemented as software running on the machine hooking into the network stack or in the case of most UNIXbased operating systems such as Linux built into the operating system kernel to provide realtime filtering and blocking Another implementation is a socalled physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the Internet Some organizations are turning to big data platforms such as Apache Hadoop to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threats In order to ensure adequate security the confidentiality integrity and availability of a network better known as the CIA triad must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security To achieve those objectives administrative physical and technical security measures should be employed The amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when its value is known Vulnerability management Vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities especially in software and firmware Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security Vulnerabilities can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities such as open ports insecure software configuration and susceptibility to malware In order for these tools to be effective they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release Typically these updates will scan for the new vulnerabilities that were introduced recently Beyond vulnerability scanning many organizations contract outside security auditors to run regular penetration tests against their systems to identify vulnerabilities In some sectors this is a contractual requirement Reducing vulnerabilities The act of assessing and reducing vulnerabilities to cyber attacks is commonly referred to as information technology security assessments They aim to assess systems for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerabilities While formal verification of the correctness of computer systems is possible it is not yet common Operating systems formally verified include seL4 and SYSGOs PikeOS but these make up a very small percentage of the market It is possible to reduce an attackers chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates and by hiring people with expertise in security Large companies with significant threats can hire Security Operations Centre SOC Analysts These are specialists in cyber defences with their role ranging from conducting threat analysis to investigating reports of any new issues and preparing and testing disaster recovery plans Whilst no measures can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack these measures can help mitigate the damage of possible attacks The effects of data lossdamage can be also reduced by careful backing up and insurance Outside of formal assessments there are various methods of reducing vulnerabilities Two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information It requires something you know a password or PIN and something you have a card dongle cellphone or another piece of hardware This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access Protecting against social engineering and direct computer access physical attacks can only happen by noncomputer means which can be difficult to enforce relative to the sensitivity of the information Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving peoples knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing peoples awareness of threats However even in highly disciplined environments eg military organizations social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent Inoculation derived from inoculation theory seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks and traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts Hardware protection mechanisms Hardwarebased or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to softwareonly computer security Using devices and methods such as dongles trusted platform modules intrusionaware cases drive locks disabling USB ports and mobileenabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access or sophisticated backdoor access required in order to be compromised Each of these is covered in more detail below USB dongles are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other devices software The dongle or key essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle such as Advanced Encryption Standard AES provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it Another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing webbased content such as cloud software or Virtual Private Networks VPNs In addition a USB dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer Trusted platform modules TPMs secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices through the use of microprocessors or socalled computersonachip TPMs used in conjunction with serverside software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices preventing unauthorized network and data access Computer case intrusion detection refers to a device typically a pushbutton switch which detects when a computer case is opened The firmware or BIOS is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time Drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives making them inaccessible to thieves Tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well Disabling USB ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer Infected USB dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine Network World as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks Disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices like camera GPS removable storage etc that are not in use Mobileenabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones Builtin capabilities such as Bluetooth the newer Bluetooth low energy LE nearfield communication NFC on noniOS devices and biometric validation such as thumbprint readers as well as QR code reader software designed for mobile devices offer new secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems These control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings IOMMUs allow for hardwarebased sandboxing of components in mobile and desktop computers by utilizing direct memory access protections Physical Unclonable Functions PUFs can be used as a digital fingerprint or a unique identifier to integrated circuits and hardware providing users the ability to secure the hardware supply chains going into their systems Secure operating systems One use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating systems Using secure operating systems is a good way of ensuring computer security These are systems that have achieved certification from an external securityauditing organization the most popular evaluations are Common Criteria CC Secure coding In software engineering secure coding aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities It is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure Such systems are secure by design Beyond this formal verification aims to prove the correctness of the algorithms underlying a system important for cryptographic protocols for example Capabilities and access control lists Within computer systems two of the main security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists ACLs and rolebased access control RBAC An accesscontrol list ACL with respect to a computer file system is a list of permissions associated with an object An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects as well as what operations are allowed on given objects Rolebased access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees and can implement mandatory access control MAC or discretionary access control DAC A further approach capabilitybased security has been mostly restricted to research operating systems Capabilities can however also be implemented at the language level leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard objectoriented design An opensource project in the area is the E language User security training The enduser is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain and it is estimated that more than 90 of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error Among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management sending emails containing sensitive data and attachments to the wrong recipient the inability to recognize misleading URLs and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments A common mistake that users make is saving their user idpassword in their browsers to make it easier to log in to banking sites This is a gift to attackers who have obtained access to a machine by some means The risk may be mitigated by the use of twofactor authentication As the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk an organization is facing security awareness training at all levels not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats The focus on the enduser represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization recognizing that a securityaware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks Digital hygiene Related to enduser training digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and as the analogy with personal hygiene shows is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measures to minimize the risks from cyber threats The assumption is that good cyber hygiene practices can give networked users another layer of protection reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attacks or compromise another node or network especially from common cyberattacks Cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence a military term The most common acts of digital hygiene can include updating malware protection cloud backups passwords and ensuring restricted admin rights and network firewalls As opposed to a purely technologybased defense against threats cyber hygiene mostly regards routine measures that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline or education It can be thought of as an abstract list of tips or measures that have been demonstrated as having a positive effect on personal or collective digital security As such these measures can be performed by laypeople not just security experts Cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene as computer viruses relate to biological viruses or pathogens However while the term computer virus was coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer viruses the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention perhaps as late as 2000 by Internet pioneer Vint Cerf It has since been adopted by the Congress and Senate of the United States the FBI EU institutions and heads of state Difficulty of responding to breaches Responding to attempted security breaches is often very difficult for a variety of reasons including Identifying attackers is difficult as they may operate through proxies temporary anonymous dialup accounts wireless connections and other anonymizing procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in another jurisdiction If they successfully breach security they have also often gained enough administrative access to enable them to delete logs to cover their tracks The sheer number of attempted attacks often by automated vulnerability scanners and computer worms is so large that organizations cannot spend time pursuing each Law enforcement officers often lack the skills interest or budget to pursue attackers Furthermore identifying attackers across a network may necessitate collecting logs from multiple locations within the network and across various countries a process that can be both difficult and timeconsuming Where an attack succeeds and a breach occurs many jurisdictions now have in place mandatory security breach notification laws Types of security and privacy Systems at risk The growth in the number of computer systems and the increasing reliance upon them by individuals businesses industries and governments means that there are an increasing number of systems at risk Financial systems The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the US Securities and Exchange Commission SWIFT investment banks and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains Websites and apps that accept or store credit card numbers brokerage accounts and bank account information are also prominent hacking targets because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money making purchases or selling the information on the black market Instore payment systems and ATMs have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and PINs The UCLA Internet Report Surveying the Digital Future 2000 found that the privacy of personal data created barriers to online sales and that more than nine out of 10 internet users were somewhat or very concerned about credit card security The most common web technologies for improving security between browsers and websites are named SSL Secure Sockets Layer and its successor TLS Transport Layer Security identity management and authentication services and domain name services allow companies and consumers to engage in secure communications and commerce Several versions of SSL and TLS are commonly used today in applications such as web browsing email internet faxing instant messaging and VoIP voiceoverIP There are various interoperable implementations of these technologies including at least one implementation that is open source Open source allows anyone to view the applications source code and look for and report vulnerabilities The credit card companies Visa and MasterCard cooperated to develop the secure EMV chip which is embedded in credit cards Further developments include the Chip Authentication Program where banks give customers handheld card readers to perform online secure transactions Other developments in this arena include the development of technology such as Instant Issuance which has enabled shopping mall kiosks acting on behalf of banks to issue onthespot credit cards to interested customers Utilities and industrial equipment Computers control functions at many utilities including coordination of telecommunications the power grid nuclear power plants and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected but the Stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable In 2014 the Computer Emergency Readiness Team a division of the Department of Homeland Security investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies Aviation The aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked A simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide much of the system relies on radio transmissions which could be disrupted and controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore There is also potential for attack from within an aircraft Implementing fixes in aerospace systems poses a unique challenge because efficient air transportation is heavily affected by weight and volume Improving security by adding physical devices to airplanes could increase their unloaded weight and could potentially reduce cargo or passenger capacity In Europe with the PanEuropean Network Service and NewPENS and in the US with the NextGen program air navigation service providers are moving to create their own dedicated networks Many modern passports are now biometric passports containing an embedded microchip that stores a digitized photograph and personal information such as name gender and date of birth In addition more countries are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identityrelated fraud The introduction of the ePassport has assisted border officials in verifying the identity of the passport holder thus allowing for quick passenger processing Plans are under way in the US the UK and Australia to introduce SmartGate kiosks with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology The airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper tickets towards the use of electronic tickets etickets These have been made possible by advances in online credit card transactions in partnership with the airlines Longdistance bus companies are also switching over to eticketing transactions today The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity air traffic control outages loss of aircraft and even loss of life Consumer devices Desktop computers and laptops are commonly targeted to gather passwords or financial account information or to construct a botnet to attack another target Smartphones tablet computers smart watches and other mobile devices such as quantified self devices like activity trackers have sensors such as cameras microphones GPS receivers compasses and accelerometers which could be exploited and may collect personal information including sensitive health information WiFi Bluetooth and cell phone networks on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breach The increasing number of home automation devices such as the Nest thermostat are also potential targets Healthcare Today many healthcare providers and health insurance companies use the internet to provide enhanced products and services Examples are the use of telehealth to potentially offer better quality and access to healthcare or fitness trackers to lower insurance premiums Hospitals increasingly use interconnected devices within their networks This is called Internet of Things IoT Connecting multiple devices within the hospital introduces various benefits such as automated detection of patient parameters electronic dose adjustments and decision support for clinicians However as these devices serve as potential access points to the hospital network security threats increase and hospitals have to introduce adequate security measures which for example comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA The health care company Humana partners with WebMD Oracle Corporation EDS and Microsoft to enable its members to access their health care records as well as to provide an overview of health care plans Patient records are increasingly being placed on secure inhouse networks alleviating the need for extra storage space Large corporations Large corporations are common targets In many cases attacks are aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involve data breaches Examples include the loss of millions of clients credit card and financial details by Home Depot Staples Target Corporation and Equifax Medical records have been targeted in general identify theft health insurance fraud and impersonating patients to obtain prescription drugs for recreational purposes or resale Although cyber threats continue to increase 62 of all organizations did not increase security training for their business in 2015 Not all attacks are financially motivated however security firm HBGary Federal had a serious series of attacks in 2011 from hacktivist group Anonymous in retaliation for the firms CEO claiming to have infiltrated their group and Sony Pictures was hacked in 2014 with the apparent dual motive of embarrassing the company through data leaks and crippling the company by wiping workstations and servers Automobiles Vehicles are increasingly computerized with engine timing cruise control antilock brakes seat belt tensioners door locks airbags and advanced driverassistance systems on many models Additionally connected cars may use WiFi and Bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network Selfdriving cars are expected to be even more complex All of these systems carry some security risks and such issues have gained wide attention Simple examples of risk include a malicious compact disc being used as an attack vector and the cars onboard microphones being used for eavesdropping However if access is gained to a cars internal controller area network the danger is much greater and in a widely publicized 2015 test hackers remotely carjacked a vehicle from 10 miles away and drove it into a ditch Manufacturers are reacting in numerous ways with Tesla in 2016 pushing out some security fixes over the air into its cars computer systems In the area of autonomous vehicles in September 2016 the United States Department of Transportation announced some initial safety standards and called for states to come up with uniform policies Additionally eDrivers licenses are being developed using the same technology For example Mexicos licensing authority ICV has used a smart card platform to issue the first eDrivers licenses to the city of Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Len Shipping Shipping companies have adopted RFID Radio Frequency Identification technology as an efficient digitally secure tracking device Unlike a barcode RFID can be read up to 20 feet away RFID is used by FedEx and UPS Government Government and military computer systems are commonly attacked by activists and foreign powers Local and regional government infrastructure such as traffic light controls police and intelligence agency communications personnel records as well as student records The FBI CIA and Pentagon all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their buildings However the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world More and more companies are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology GEs ACUVision for example offers a single panel platform for access control alarm monitoring and digital recording Internet of things and physical vulnerabilities The Internet of things IoT is the network of physical objects such as devices vehicles and buildings that are embedded with electronics software sensors and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data Concerns have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenges involved While the IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems it also provides opportunities for misuse In particular as the Internet of Things spreads widely cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical rather than simply virtual threat If a front doors lock is connected to the Internet and can be lockedunlocked from a phone then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone People could stand to lose much more than their credit card numbers in a world controlled by IoTenabled devices Thieves have also used electronic means to circumvent nonInternetconnected hotel door locks An attack aimed at physical infrastructure or human lives is often called a cyberkinetic attack As IoT devices and appliances become more widespread the prevalence and potential damage of cyberkinetic attacks can increase substantially Medical systems Medical devices have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerabilities demonstrated including both inhospital diagnostic equipment and implanted devices including pacemakers and insulin pumps There are many reports of hospitals and hospital organizations getting hacked including ransomware attacks Windows XP exploits viruses and data breaches of sensitive data stored on hospital servers On 28 December 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of Internetconnected devices but no structure for enforcement Energy sector In distributed generation systems the risk of a cyber attack is real according to Daily Energy Insider An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources DER Authority within the city with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility Pepco the chance to better estimate energy demand The DC proposal however would allow thirdparty vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution which could potentially create more opportunities for cyber attackers to threaten the electric grid Telecommunications Perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the SIM Subscriber Identity Module card a device that is embedded in most of the worlds cellular devices before any service can be obtained The SIM card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment The Smart Card Web Servers draft standard SCWS defines the interfaces to an HTTP server in a smart card Tests are being conducted to secure OTA overtheair payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone Combination SIMDVD devices are being developed through Smart Video Card technology which embeds a DVDcompliant optical disc into the card body of a regular SIM card Other telecommunication developments involving digital security include mobile signatures which use the embedded SIM card to generate a legally binding electronic signature Cost and impact of security breaches Serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from 13 billion worms and viruses only to 226 billion for all forms of covert attacks The reliability of these estimates is often challenged the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal However reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions According to the classic GordonLoeb Model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss ie the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyberinformation security breach Attacker motivation As with physical security the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers Some are thrillseekers or vandals some are activists others are criminals looking for financial gain Statesponsored attackers are now common and well resourced but started with amateurs such as Markus Hess who hacked for the KGB as recounted by Clifford Stoll in The Cuckoos Egg Attackers motivations can vary for all types of attacks from pleasure to political goals For example hacktivists may target a company or organization that carries out activities they do not agree with This would be to create bad publicity for the company by having its website crash High capability hackers often with larger backing or state sponsorship may attack based on the demands of their financial backers These attacks are more likely to attempt more serious attack An example of a more serious attack was the 2015 Ukraine power grid hack which reportedly utilised the spearphising destruction of files and denialofservice attacks to carry out the full attack Additionally recent attacker motivations can be traced back to extremist organizations seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agendas The growth of the internet mobile technologies and inexpensive computing devices have led to a rise in capabilities but also to the risk to environments that are deemed as vital to operations All critical targeted environments are susceptible to compromise and this has led to a series of proactive studies on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivations by these types of actors Several stark differences exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actors seeking to attack based on an ideological preference A key aspect of threat modeling for any system is identifying the motivations behind potential attacks and the individuals or groups likely to carry them out The level and detail of security measures will differ based on the specific system being protected For instance a home personal computer a bank and a classified military network each face distinct threats despite using similar underlying technologies Computer security incident management Computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such as a data breach or system failure The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident limit damage and assist recovery to business as usual Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities restore services and processes and minimize losses Incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organizations response to a cyberattack Without a documented plan in place an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles processes and procedures during an escalation slowing the organizations response and resolution There are four key components of a computer security incident response plan Preparation Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises Detection and analysis Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident Containment eradication and recovery Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact pinpointing the genesis of the incident removing malware affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains Post incident activity Post mortem analysis of the incident its root cause and the organizations response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts Notable attacks and breaches Some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below Robert Morris and the first computer worm In 1988 60000 computers were connected to the Internet and most were mainframes minicomputers and professional workstations On 2 November 1988 many started to slow down because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers the first internet computer worm The software was traced back to 23yearold Cornell University graduate student Robert Tappan Morris who said he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet Rome Laboratory In 1994 over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the Rome Laboratory the US Air Forces main command and research facility Using trojan horses hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Romes networking systems and remove traces of their activities The intruders were able to obtain classified files such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of National Aeronautics and Space Administrations Goddard Space Flight Center WrightPatterson Air Force Base some Defense contractors and other private sector organizations by posing as a trusted Rome center user TJX customer credit card details In early 2007 American apparel and home goods company TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion and that the hackers had accessed a system that stored data on credit card debit card check and merchandise return transactions Stuxnet attack In 2010 the computer worm known as Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost onefifth of Irans nuclear centrifuges It did so by disrupting industrial programmable logic controllers PLCs in a targeted attack This is generally believed to have been launched by Israel and the United States to disrupt Irans nuclear program although neither has publicly admitted this Global surveillance disclosures In early 2013 documents provided by Edward Snowden were published by The Washington Post and The Guardian exposing the massive scale of NSA global surveillance There were also indications that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor in a NIST standard for encryption This standard was later withdrawn due to widespread criticism The NSA additionally were revealed to have tapped the links between Googles data centers Target and Home Depot breaches A Ukrainian hacker known as Rescator broke into Target Corporation computers in 2013 stealing roughly 40 million credit cards and then Home Depot computers in 2014 stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers Warnings were delivered at both corporations but ignored physical security breaches using self checkout machines are believed to have played a large role The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting says Jim Walter director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrators responded to the warnings The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing Office of Personnel Management data breach In April 2015 the Office of Personnel Management discovered it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach resulting in the theft of approximately 215 million personnel records handled by the office The Office of Personnel Management hack has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States Data targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers names dates and places of birth addresses and fingerprints of current and former government employees as well as anyone who had undergone a government background check It is believed the hack was perpetrated by Chinese hackers Ashley Madison breach In July 2015 a hacker group is known as The Impact Team successfully breached the extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison created by Avid Life Media The group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well After the breach The Impact Team dumped emails from the companys CEO to prove their point and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently When Avid Life Media did not take the site offline the group released two more compressed files one 97GB and the second 20GB After the second data dump Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned but the website remained to function Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack In June 2021 the cyber attack took down the largest fuel pipeline in the US and led to shortages across the East Coast Legal issues and global regulation International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature There is no global base of common rules to judge and eventually punish cybercrimes and cybercriminals and where security firms or agencies do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of malware or form of cyber attack often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute Proving attribution for cybercrimes and cyberattacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agencies Computer viruses switch from one country to another from one jurisdiction to another moving around the world using the fact that we dont have the capability to globally police operations like this So the Internet is as if someone had given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world The use of techniques such as dynamic DNS fast flux and bullet proof servers add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement Role of government The role of the government is to make regulations to force companies and organizations to protect their systems infrastructure and information from any cyberattacks but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national powergrid The governments regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated For some cyberspace was seen as a virtual space that was to remain free of government intervention as can be seen in many of todays libertarian blockchain and bitcoin discussions Many government officials and experts think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem R Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco he believes that the industry only responds when you threaten regulation If the industry doesnt respond to the threat you have to follow through On the other hand executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary but think that government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently Daniel R McCarthy analyzed this publicprivate partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political order On 22 May 2020 the UN Security Council held its second ever informal meeting on cybersecurity to focus on cyber challenges to international peace According to UN SecretaryGeneral Antnio Guterres new technologies are too often used to violate rights International actions Many different teams and organizations exist including The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams FIRST is the global association of CSIRTs The USCERT ATT Apple Cisco McAfee Microsoft are all members of this international team The Council of Europe helps protect societies worldwide from the threat of cybercrime through the Convention on Cybercrime The purpose of the Messaging AntiAbuse Working Group MAAWG is to bring the messaging industry together to work collaboratively and to successfully address the various forms of messaging abuse such as spam viruses denialofservice attacks and other messaging exploitations France Telecom Facebook ATT Apple Cisco Sprint are some of the members of the MAAWG ENISA The European Network and Information Security Agency ENISA is an agency of the European Union with the objective to improve network and information security in the European Union Europe On 14 April 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR The GDPR which came into force on 25 May 2018 grants individuals within the European Union EU and the European Economic Area EEA the right to the protection of personal data The regulation requires that any entity that processes personal data incorporate data protection by design and by default It also requires that certain organizations appoint a Data Protection Officer DPO National actions Computer emergency response teams Most countries have their own computer emergency response team to protect network security Canada Since 2010 Canada has had a cybersecurity strategy This functions as a counterpart document to the National Strategy and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure The strategy has three main pillars securing government systems securing vital private cyber systems and helping Canadians to be secure online There is also a Cyber Incident Management Framework to provide a coordinated response in the event of a cyber incident The Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre CCIRC is responsible for mitigating and responding to threats to Canadas critical infrastructure and cyber systems It provides support to mitigate cyber threats technical support to respond recover from targeted cyber attacks and provides online tools for members of Canadas critical infrastructure sectors It posts regular cybersecurity bulletins operates an online reporting tool where individuals and organizations can report a cyber incident To inform the general public on how to protect themselves online Public Safety Canada has partnered with STOPTHINKCONNECT a coalition of nonprofit private sector and government organizations and launched the Cyber Security Cooperation Program They also run the GetCyberSafe portal for Canadian citizens and Cyber Security Awareness Month during October Public Safety Canada aims to begin an evaluation of Canadas cybersecurity strategy in early 2015 Australia Australian federal government announced an 182 million investment to fortify the cybersecurity resilience of small and medium enterprises SMEs and enhance their capabilities in responding to cyber threats This financial backing is an integral component of the soontobeunveiled 20232030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy slated for release within the current week A substantial allocation of 72 million is earmarked for the establishment of a voluntary cyber health check program facilitating businesses in conducting a comprehensive and tailored selfassessment of their cybersecurity upskill This avantgarde health assessment serves as a diagnostic tool enabling enterprises to ascertain the robustness of Australias cyber security regulations Furthermore it affords them access to a repository of educational resources and materials fostering the acquisition of skills necessary for an elevated cybersecurity posture This groundbreaking initiative was jointly disclosed by Minister for Cyber Security Clare ONeil and Minister for Small Business Julie Collins India Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000 The National Cyber Security Policy 2013 is a policy framework by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology MeitY which aims to protect the public and private infrastructure from cyberattacks and safeguard information such as personal information of web users financial and banking information and sovereign data CERT In is the nodal agency which monitors the cyber threats in the country The post of National Cyber Security Coordinator has also been created in the Prime Ministers Office PMO The Indian Companies Act 2013 has also introduced cyber law and cybersecurity obligations on the part of Indian directors Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000 Update in 2013 South Korea Following cyberattacks in the first half of 2013 when the government news media television stations and bank websites were compromised the national government committed to the training of 5000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017 The South Korean government blamed its northern counterpart for these attacks as well as incidents that occurred in 2009 2011 and 2012 but Pyongyang denies the accusations United States Cyber Plan The United States has its first fully formed cyber plan in 15 years as a result of the release of this National Cyber plan In this policy the US says it will Protect the country by keeping networks systems functions and data safe Promote American wealth by building a strong digital economy and encouraging strong domestic innovation Peace and safety should be kept by making it easier for the US to stop people from using computer tools for bad things working with friends and partners to do this and increase the United States impact around the world to support the main ideas behind an open safe reliable and compatible Internet The new US cyber strategy seeks to allay some of those concerns by promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace urging nations to adhere to a set of norms both through international law and voluntary standards It also calls for specific measures to harden US government networks from attacks like the June 2015 intrusion into the US Office of Personnel Management OPM which compromised the records of about 42 million current and former government employees And the strategy calls for the US to continue to name and shame bad cyber actors calling them out publicly for attacks when possible along with the use of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure Legislation The 1986 18 USC 1030 the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the key legislation It prohibits unauthorized access or damage of protected computers as defined in 18 USC 1030e2 Although various other measures have been proposed none have succeeded In 2013 executive order 13636 Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was signed which prompted the creation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework In response to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14028 on May 12 2021 to increase software security standards for sales to the government tighten detection and security on existing systems improve information sharing and training establish a Cyber Safety Review Board and improve incident response Standardized government testing services The General Services Administration GSA has standardized the penetration test service as a prevetted support service to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities and stop adversaries before they impact US federal state and local governments These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services HACS Agencies The Department of Homeland Security has a dedicated division responsible for the response system risk management program and requirements for cybersecurity in the United States called the National Cyber Security Division The division is home to USCERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure The third priority of the FBI is to Protect the United States against cyberbased attacks and hightechnology crimes and they along with the National White Collar Crime Center NW3C and the Bureau of Justice Assistance BJA are part of the multiagency task force The Internet Crime Complaint Center also known as IC3 In addition to its own specific duties the FBI participates alongside nonprofit organizations such as InfraGard The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section CCIPS operates in the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division The CCIPS is in charge of investigating computer crime and intellectual property crime and is specialized in the search and seizure of digital evidence in computers and networks In 2017 CCIPS published A Framework for a Vulnerability Disclosure Program for Online Systems to help organizations clearly describe authorized vulnerability disclosure and discovery conduct thereby substantially reducing the likelihood that such described activities will result in a civil or criminal violation of law under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 USC 1030 The United States Cyber Command also known as USCYBERCOM has the mission to direct synchronize and coordinate cyberspace planning and operations to defend and advance national interests in collaboration with domestic and international partners It has no role in the protection of civilian networks The US Federal Communications Commissions role in cybersecurity is to strengthen the protection of critical communications infrastructure to assist in maintaining the reliability of networks during disasters to aid in swift recovery after and to ensure that first responders have access to effective communications services The Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance for medical devices and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is concerned with automotive cybersecurity After being criticized by the Government Accountability Office and following successful attacks on airports and claimed attacks on airplanes the Federal Aviation Administration has devoted funding to securing systems on board the planes of private manufacturers and the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System Concerns have also been raised about the future Next Generation Air Transportation System The US Department of Defense DoD issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004 supplemented by DoD Directive 8140 requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology IT certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge skills and abilities KSA Andersson and Reimers 2019 report these certifications range from CompTIAs A and Security through the ICS2orgs CISSP etc Computer emergency readiness team Computer emergency response team is a name given to expert groups that handle computer security incidents In the US two distinct organizations exist although they do work closely together USCERT part of the National Cyber Security Division of the United States Department of Homeland Security CERTCC created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA and run by the Software Engineering Institute SEI US NRC 10 CFR 7354 Cybersecurity In the context of US nuclear power plants the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC outlines cybersecurity requirements under 10 CFR Part 73 specifically in 7354 NEI 0809 Cybersecurity Plan for Nuclear Power Plants The Nuclear Energy Institutes NEI 0809 document Cyber Security Plan for Nuclear Power Reactors outlines a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity in the nuclear power industry Drafted with input from the US NRC this guideline is instrumental in aiding licensees to comply with the Code of Federal Regulations CFR which mandates robust protection of digital computers and equipment and communications systems at nuclear power plants against cyber threats Modern warfare There is growing concern that cyberspace will become the next theater of warfare As Mark Clayton from The Christian Science Monitor wrote in a 2015 article titled The New Cyber Arms Race In the future wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities transportation communications and energy Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops the path of jet fighters the command and control of warships This has led to new terms such as cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism The United States Cyber Command was created in 2009 and many other countries have similar forces There are a few critical voices that question whether cybersecurity is as significant a threat as it is made out to be Careers Cybersecurity is a fastgrowing field of IT concerned with reducing organizations risk of hack or data breaches According to research from the Enterprise Strategy Group 46 of organizations say that they have a problematic shortage of cybersecurity skills in 2016 up from 28 in 2015 Commercial government and nongovernmental organizations all employ cybersecurity professionals The fastest increases in demand for cybersecurity workers are in industries managing increasing volumes of consumer data such as finance health care and retail However the use of the term cybersecurity is more prevalent in government job descriptions Typical cybersecurity job titles and descriptions include Security analyst Analyzes and assesses vulnerabilities in the infrastructure software hardware networks investigates using available tools and countermeasures to remedy the detected vulnerabilities and recommends solutions and best practices Analyzes and assesses damage to the datainfrastructure as a result of security incidents examines available recovery tools and processes and recommends solutions Tests for compliance with security policies and procedures May assist in the creation implementation or management of security solutions Security engineer Performs security monitoring security and datalogs analysis and forensic analysis to detect security incidents and mount the incident response Investigates and utilizes new technologies and processes to enhance security capabilities and implement improvements May also review code or perform other security engineering methodologies Security architect Designs a security system or major components of a security system and may head a security design team building a new security system Chief Information Security Officer CISO A highlevel management position responsible for the entire information security divisionstaff The position may include handson technical work Chief Security Officer CSO A highlevel management position responsible for the entire security divisionstaff A newer position is now deemed needed as security risks grow Data Protection Officer DPO A DPO is tasked with monitoring compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR data protection policies awarenessraising training and audits Security ConsultantSpecialistIntelligence Broad titles that encompass any one or all of the other roles or titles tasked with protecting computers networks software data or information systems against viruses worms spyware malware intrusion detection unauthorized access denialofservice attacks and an everincreasing list of attacks by hackers acting as individuals or as part of organized crime or foreign governments Student programs are also available for people interested in beginning a career in cybersecurity Meanwhile a flexible and effective option for information security professionals of all experience levels to keep studying is online security training including webcasts A wide range of certified courses are also available In the United Kingdom a nationwide set of cybersecurity forums known as the UK Cyber Security Forum were established supported by the Governments cybersecurity strategy in order to encourage startups and innovation and to address the skills gap identified by the UK Government In Singapore the Cyber Security Agency has issued a Singapore Operational Technology OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework OTCCF The framework defines emerging cybersecurity roles in Operational Technology The OTCCF was endorsed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority IMDA It outlines the different OT cybersecurity job positions as well as the technical skills and core competencies necessary It also depicts the many career paths available including vertical and lateral advancement opportunities Terminology The following terms used with regards to computer security are explained below Access authorization restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems These systems can protect either the whole computer such as through an interactive login screen or individual services such as a FTP server There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users such as passwords identification cards smart cards and biometric systems Antivirus software consists of computer programs that attempt to identify thwart and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software malware Applications are executable code so general corporate practice is to restrict or block users the power to install them to install them only when there is a demonstrated need eg software needed to perform assignments to install only those which are known to be reputable preferably with access to the computer code used to create the application and to reduce the attack surface by installing as few as possible They are typically run with least privilege with a robust process in place to identify test and install any released security patches or updates for them For example programs can be installed into an individual users account which limits the programs potential access as well as being a means control which users have specific exceptions to policy In Linux FreeBSD OpenBSD and other Unixlike operating systems there is an option to further restrict an application using chroot or other means of restricting the application to its own sandbox For example Linux provides namespaces and Cgroups to further restrict the access of an application to system resources Generalized security frameworks such as SELinux or AppArmor help administrators control access Java and other languages which compile to Java byte code and run in the Java virtual machine can have their access to other applications controlled at the virtual machine level Some software can be run in software containers which can even provide their own set of system libraries limiting the softwares or anyone controlling it access to the servers versions of the libraries Authentication techniques can be used to ensure that communication endpoints are who they say they are Automated theorem proving and other verification tools can be used to enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications Backups are one or more copies kept of important computer files Typically multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged other copies will still exist Capability and access control list techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control Capabilities vs ACLs discusses their use Chain of trust techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the systems designers Confidentiality is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person Cryptographic techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems reducing the probability that the data exchange between systems can be intercepted or modified Cyber attribution is an attribution of cybercrime ie finding who perpetrated a cyberattack Cyberwarfare is an Internetbased conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems Such attacks can for example disable official websites and networks disrupt or disable essential services steal or alter classified data and cripple financial systems Data integrity is the accuracy and consistency of stored data indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record Encryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message Cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible Symmetrickey ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys and publickey encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance Endpoint security software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops mobile devices and USB drives Firewalls serve as a gatekeeper system between networks allowing only traffic that matches defined rules They often include detailed logging and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features They are nearuniversal between company local area networks and the Internet but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured A hacker is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network Honey pots are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques Intrusiondetection systems are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations A microkernel is an approach to operating system design which has only the nearminimum amount of code running at the most privileged level and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers protocol stacks and file systems in the safer less privileged user space Pinging The standard ping application can be used to test if an IP address is in use If it is attackers may then try a port scan to detect which services are exposed A port scan is used to probe an IP address for open ports to identify accessible network services and applications A key logger is spyware that silently captures and stores each keystroke that a user types on the computers keyboard Social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security Logic bombs is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lies dormant until it is triggered by a specific event A unikernel is a computer program that runs on a minimalistic operating system where a single application is allowed to run as opposed to a general purpose operating system where many applications can run at the same time This approach to minimizing the attack surface is adopted mostly in cloud environments where software is deployed in virtual machines Zero trust security means that no one is trusted by default from inside or outside the network and verification is required from everyone trying to gain access to resources on the network History Since the Internets arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent years the notion of cybersecurity has become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal lives Cybersecurity and cyber threats have been consistently present for the last 60 years of technological change In the 1970s and 1980s computer security was mainly limited to academia until the conception of the Internet where with increased connectivity computer viruses and network intrusions began to take off After the spread of viruses in the 1990s the 2000s marked the institutionalization of organized attacks such as distributed denial of service This led to the formalization of cybersecurity as a professional discipline The April 1967 session organized by Willis Ware at the Spring Joint Computer Conference and the later publication of the Ware Report were foundational moments in the history of the field of computer security Wares work straddled the intersection of material cultural political and social concerns A 1977 NIST publication introduced the CIA triad of confidentiality integrity and availability as a clear and simple way to describe key security goals While still relevant many more elaborate frameworks have since been proposed However in the 1970s and 1980s there were no grave computer threats because computers and the internet were still developing and security threats were easily identifiable More often threats came from malicious insiders who gained unauthorized access to sensitive documents and files Although malware and network breaches existed during the early years they did not use them for financial gain By the second half of the 1970s established computer firms like IBM started offering commercial access control systems and computer security software products One of the earliest examples of an attack on a computer network was the computer worm Creeper written by Bob Thomas at BBN which propagated through the ARPANET in 1971 The program was purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload A later program Reaper was created by Ray Tomlinson in 1972 and used to destroy Creeper Between September 1986 and June 1987 a group of German hackers performed the first documented case of cyber espionage The group hacked into American defense contractors universities and military base networks and sold gathered information to the Soviet KGB The group was led by Markus Hess who was arrested on 29 June 1987 He was convicted of espionage along with two coconspirators on 15 Feb 1990 In 1988 one of the first computer worms called the Morris worm was distributed via the Internet It gained significant mainstream media attention In 1993 Netscape started developing the protocol SSL shortly after the National Center for Supercomputing Applications NCSA launched Mosaic 10 the first web browser in 1993 Netscape had SSL version 10 ready in 1994 but it was never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerabilities These weaknesses included replay attacks and a vulnerability that allowed hackers to alter unencrypted communications sent by users However in February 1995 Netscape launched Version 20 The National Security Agency NSA is responsible for the protection of US information systems and also for collecting foreign intelligence The agency analyzes commonly used software and system configurations to find security flaws which it can use for offensive purposes against competitors of the United States NSA contractors created and sold clickandshoot attack tools to US agencies and close allies but eventually the tools made their way to foreign adversaries In 2016 NSAs own hacking tools were hacked and they have been used by Russia and North Korea NSAs employees and contractors have been recruited at high salaries by adversaries anxious to compete in cyberwarfare In 2007 the United States and Israel began exploiting security flaws in the Microsoft Windows operating system to attack and damage equipment used in Iran to refine nuclear materials Iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability which it began using against the United States Notable scholars

    title: "Internet of Things",
    originalContent:
      "Internet of things IoT describes devices with sensors processing ability software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communication networks The Internet of things encompasses electronics communication and computer science engineering Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies including ubiquitous computing commodity sensors and increasingly powerful embedded systems as well as machine learning Older fields of embedded systems wireless sensor networks control systems automation including home and building automation independently and collectively enable the Internet of things In the consumer market IoT technology is most synonymous with smart home products including devices and appliances lighting fixtures thermostats home security systems cameras and other home appliances that support one or more common ecosystems and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem such as smartphones and smart speakers IoT is also used in healthcare systems There are a number of concerns about the risks in the growth of IoT technologies and products especially in the areas of privacy and security and consequently there have been industry and government moves to address these concerns including the development of international and local standards guidelines and regulatory frameworks Because of their interconnected nature IoT devices are vulnerable to security breaches and privacy concerns At the same time the way these devices communicate wirelessly creates regulatory ambiguities complicating jurisdictional boundaries of the data transfer Background Around 1972 for its remote site use Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory developed a computer controlled vending machine adapted from a machine rented from Canteen Vending which sold for cash or though a computer terminal Teletype Model 33 KSR on credit Products included at least beer yogurt and milk It was called the Prancing Pony after the name of the room named after an inn in Tolkiens Lord of the Rings as each room at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was named after a place in Middle Earth A successor version still operates in the Computer Science Department at Stanford with both hardware and software having been updated History In 1982 an early concept of a network connected smart device was built as an internet interface for sensors installed in the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Departments departmental CocaCola vending machine supplied by graduate student volunteers provided a temperature model and an inventory status inspired by the computer controlled vending machine in the Prancing Pony room at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory First accessible only on the CMU campus it became the first ARPANETconnected appliance Mark Weisers 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing The Computer of the 21st Century as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IoT In 1994 Reza Raji described the concept in IEEE Spectrum as moving small packets of data to a large set of nodes so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories Between 1993 and 1997 several companies proposed solutions like Microsofts at Work or Novells NEST The field gained momentum when Bill Joy envisioned devicetodevice communication as a part of his Six Webs framework presented at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1999 The concept of the Internet of things and the term itself first appeared in a speech by Peter T Lewis to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 15th Annual Legislative Weekend in Washington DC published in September 1985 According to Lewis The Internet of Things or IoT is the integration of people processes and technology with connectable devices and sensors to enable remote monitoring status manipulation and evaluation of trends of such devices The term Internet of things was coined independently by Kevin Ashton of Procter Gamble later of MITs AutoID Center in 1999 though he prefers the phrase Internet for things At that point he viewed radiofrequency identification RFID as essential to the Internet of things which would allow computers to manage all individual things The main theme of the Internet of things is to embed shortrange mobile transceivers in various gadgets and daily necessities to enable new forms of communication between people and things and between things themselves In 2004 Cornelius Pete Peterson CEO of NetSilicon predicted that The next era of information technology will be dominated by IoT devices and networked devices will ultimately gain in popularity and significance to the extent that they will far exceed the number of networked computers and workstations Peterson believed that medical devices and industrial controls would become dominant applications of the technology Defining the Internet of things as simply the point in time when more things or objects were connected to the Internet than people Cisco Systems estimated that the IoT was born between 2008 and 2009 with the thingspeople ratio growing from 008 in 2003 to 184 in 2010 Applications The extensive set of applications for IoT devices is often divided into consumer commercial industrial and infrastructure spaces Consumers A growing portion of IoT devices is created for consumer use including connected vehicles home automation wearable technology connected health and appliances with remote monitoring capabilities Home automation IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation which can include lighting heating and air conditioning media and security systems and camera systems Longterm benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off or by making the residents in the home aware of usage A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and appliances For instance using Apples HomeKit manufacturers can have their home products and accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch This could be a dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri This can be demonstrated in the case of Lenovos Smart Home Essentials which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apples Home app or Siri without the need for a WiFi bridge There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are offered as standalone platforms to connect different smart home products These include the Amazon Echo Google Home Apples HomePod and Samsungs SmartThings Hub In addition to the commercial systems there are many nonproprietary open source ecosystems including Home Assistant OpenHAB and Domoticz Elder care One key application of a smart home is to assist the elderly and disabled These home systems use assistive technology to accommodate an owners specific disabilities Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can be connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearingimpaired users They can also be equipped with additional safety features including sensors that monitor for medical emergencies such as falls or seizures Smart home technology applied in this way can provide users with more freedom and a higher quality of life Organizations The term Enterprise IoT refers to devices used in business and corporate settings Medical and healthcare The Internet of Medical Things IoMT is an application of the IoT for medical and healthrelated purposes data collection and analysis for research and monitoring The IoMT has been referenced as Smart Healthcare as the technology for creating a digitized healthcare system connecting available medical resources and healthcare services IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems These health monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of monitoring specialized implants such as pacemakers Fitbit electronic wristbands or advanced hearing aids Some hospitals have begun implementing smart beds that can detect when they are occupied and when a patient is attempting to get up It can also adjust itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support are applied to the patient without the manual interaction of nurses A 2015 Goldman Sachs report indicated that healthcare IoT devices can save the United States more than 300 billion in annual healthcare expenditures by increasing revenue and decreasing cost Moreover the use of mobile devices to support medical followup led to the creation of mhealth used analyzed health statistics Specialized sensors can also be equipped within living spaces to monitor the health and general wellbeing of senior citizens while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people to regain lost mobility via therapy as well These sensors create a network of intelligent sensors that are able to collect process transfer and analyze valuable information in different environments such as connecting inhome monitoring devices to hospitalbased systems Other consumer devices to encourage healthy living such as connected scales or wearable heart monitors are also a possibility with the IoT Endtoend health monitoring IoT platforms are also available for antenatal and chronic patients helping one manage health vitals and recurring medication requirements Advances in plastic and fabric electronics fabrication methods have enabled ultralow cost useandthrow IoMT sensors These sensors along with the required RFID electronics can be fabricated on paper or etextiles for wireless powered disposable sensing devices Applications have been established for pointofcare medical diagnostics where portability and low systemcomplexity is essential As of 2018 IoMT was not only being applied in the clinical laboratory industry but also in the healthcare and health insurance industries IoMT in the healthcare industry is now permitting doctors patients and others such as guardians of patients nurses families and similar to be part of a system where patient records are saved in a database allowing doctors and the rest of the medical staff to have access to patient information IoT devices within healthcare are structured in a multilayered architecture Initially data is collected from the devices and sensors within the IoT Subsequently data is processed and stored within the institutions network At this point data becomes accessible for further internal and external procedures Simultaneously data is protected via various cybersecurity measures such as the principle of least privilege PoLP data encryption for example with the Advanced Encryption Standard AES intrusion detection systems IDS and intrusion prevention systems IPS Lastly data can be accessed by users on workstations or portable devices through applications like patient management software PMS IoMT in the insurance industry provides access to better and new types of dynamic information This includes sensorbased solutions such as biosensors wearables connected health devices and mobile apps to track customer behavior This can lead to more accurate underwriting and new pricing models The application of the IoT in healthcare plays a fundamental role in managing chronic diseases and in disease prevention and control Remote monitoring is made possible through the connection of powerful wireless solutions The connectivity enables health practitioners to capture patients data and apply complex algorithms in health data analysis Transportation The IoT can assist in the integration of communications control and information processing across various transportation systems Application of the IoT extends to all aspects of transportation systems ie the vehicle the infrastructure and the driver or user Dynamic interaction between these components of a transport system enables inter and intravehicular communication smart traffic control smart parking electronic toll collection systems logistics and fleet management vehicle control safety and road assistance V2X communications In vehicular communication systems vehicletoeverything communication V2X consists of three main components vehicletovehicle communication V2V vehicletoinfrastructure communication V2I and vehicle to pedestrian communications V2P V2X is the first step to autonomous driving and connected road infrastructure Home automation IoT devices can be used to monitor and control the mechanical electrical and electronic systems used in various types of buildings eg public and private industrial institutions or residential in home automation and building automation systems In this context three main areas are being covered in literature The integration of the Internet with building energy management systems to create energyefficient and IOTdriven smart buildings The possible means of realtime monitoring for reducing energy consumption and monitoring occupant behaviors The integration of smart devices in the built environment and how they might be used in future applications Industrial Also known as IIoT industrial IoT devices acquire and analyze data from connected equipment operational technology OT locations and people Combined with operational technology OT monitoring devices IIoT helps regulate and monitor industrial systems Also the same implementation can be carried out for automated record updates of asset placement in industrial storage units as the size of the assets can vary from a small screw to the whole motor spare part and misplacement of such assets can cause a loss of manpower time and money Manufacturing The IoT can connect various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing identification processing communication actuation and networking capabilities Network control and management of manufacturing equipment asset and situation management or manufacturing process control allow IoT to be used for industrial applications and smart manufacturing IoT intelligent systems enable rapid manufacturing and optimization of new products and rapid response to product demands Digital control systems to automate process controls operator tools and service information systems to optimize plant safety and security are within the purview of the IIoT IoT can also be applied to asset management via predictive maintenance statistical evaluation and measurements to maximize reliability Industrial management systems can be integrated with smart grids enabling energy optimization Measurements automated controls plant optimization health and safety management and other functions are provided by networked sensors In addition to general manufacturing IoT is also used for processes in the industrialization of construction Agriculture There are numerous IoT applications in farming such as collecting data on temperature rainfall humidity wind speed pest infestation and soil content This data can be used to automate farming techniques take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity minimize risk and waste and reduce the effort required to manage crops For example farmers can now monitor soil temperature and moisture from afar and even apply IoTacquired data to precision fertilization programs The overall goal is that data from sensors coupled with the farmers knowledge and intuition about his or her farm can help increase farm productivity and also help reduce costs In August 2018 Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the Microsoft Azure application suite for IoT technologies related to water management Developed in part by researchers from Kindai University the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number of fish on a conveyor belt analyze the number of fish and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the data the fish provide The FarmBeats project from Microsoft Research that uses TV white space to connect farms is also a part of the Azure Marketplace now Maritime IoT devices are in use to monitor the environments and systems of boats and yachts Many pleasure boats are left unattended for days in summer and months in winter so such devices provide valuable early alerts of boat flooding fire and deep discharge of batteries The use of global internet data networks such as Sigfox combined with longlife batteries and microelectronics allows the engine rooms bilge and batteries to be constantly monitored and reported to connected Android Apple applications for example Infrastructure Monitoring and controlling operations of sustainable urban and rural infrastructures like bridges railway tracks and on and offshore wind farms is a key application of the IoT The IoT infrastructure can be used for monitoring any events or changes in structural conditions that can compromise safety and increase risk The IoT can benefit the construction industry by costsaving time reduction better quality workday paperless workflow and increase in productivity It can help in taking faster decisions and saving money in RealTime Data Analytics It can also be used for scheduling repair and maintenance activities efficiently by coordinating tasks between different service providers and users of these facilities IoT devices can also be used to control critical infrastructure like bridges to provide access to ships The usage of IoT devices for monitoring and operating infrastructure is likely to improve incident management and emergency response coordination and quality of service uptimes and reduce costs of operation in all infrastructurerelated areas Even areas such as waste management can benefit Metropolitan scale deployments There are several planned or ongoing largescale deployments of the IoT to enable better management of cities and systems For example Songdo South Korea the first of its kind fully equipped and wired smart city is gradually being built with approximately 70 percent of the business district completed as of June 2018 Much of the city is planned to be wired and automated with little or no human intervention In 2014 another application was undergoing a project in Santander Spain For this deployment two approaches have been adopted This city of 180000 inhabitants has already seen 18000 downloads of its city smartphone app The app is connected to 10000 sensors that enable services like parking search and environmental monitoring City context information is used in this deployment so as to benefit merchants through a spark deals mechanism based on city behavior that aims at maximizing the impact of each notification Other examples of largescale deployments underway include the SinoSingapore Guangzhou Knowledge City work on improving air and water quality reducing noise pollution and increasing transportation efficiency in San Jose California and smart traffic management in western Singapore Using its RPMA Random Phase Multiple Access technology San Diegobased Ingenu has built a nationwide public network for lowbandwidth data transmissions using the same unlicensed 24 gigahertz spectrum as WiFi Ingenus Machine Network covers more than a third of the US population across 35 major cities including San Diego and Dallas French company Sigfox commenced building an Ultra Narrowband wireless data network in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014 the first business to achieve such a deployment in the US It subsequently announced it would set up a total of 4000 base stations to cover a total of 30 cities in the US by the end of 2016 making it the largest IoT network coverage provider in the country thus far Cisco also participates in smart cities projects Cisco has deployed technologies for Smart WiFi Smart Safety Security Smart Lighting Smart Parking Smart Transports Smart Bus Stops Smart Kiosks Remote Expert for Government Services REGS and Smart Education in the five km area in the city of Vijaywada India Another example of a large deployment is the one completed by New York Waterways in New York City to connect all the citys vessels and be able to monitor them live 247 The network was designed and engineered by Fluidmesh Networks a Chicagobased company developing wireless networks for critical applications The NYWW network is currently providing coverage on the Hudson River East River and Upper New York Bay With the wireless network in place NY Waterway is able to take control of its fleet and passengers in a way that was not previously possible New applications can include security energy and fleet management digital signage public WiFi paperless ticketing and others Energy management Significant numbers of energyconsuming devices eg lamps household appliances motors pumps etc already integrate Internet connectivity which can allow them to communicate with utilities not only to balance power generation but also helps optimize the energy consumption as a whole These devices allow for remote control by users or central management via a cloudbased interface and enable functions like scheduling eg remotely powering on or off heating systems controlling ovens changing lighting conditions etc The smart grid is a utilityside IoT application systems gather and act on energy and powerrelated information to improve the efficiency of the production and distribution of electricity Using advanced metering infrastructure AMI Internetconnected devices electric utilities not only collect data from endusers but also manage distribution automation devices like transformers Environmental monitoring Environmental monitoring applications of the IoT typically use sensors to assist in environmental protection by monitoring air or water quality atmospheric or soil conditions and can even include areas like monitoring the movements of wildlife and their habitats Development of resourceconstrained devices connected to the Internet also means that other applications like earthquake or tsunami earlywarning systems can also be used by emergency services to provide more effective aid IoT devices in this application typically span a large geographic area and can also be mobile It has been argued that the standardization that IoT brings to wireless sensing will revolutionize this area Living Lab Another example of integrating the IoT is Living Lab which integrates and combines research and innovation processes establishing within a publicprivatepeoplepartnership Between 2006 and January 2024 there were over 440 Living Labs though not all are currently active that use the IoT to collaborate and share knowledge between stakeholders to cocreate innovative and technological products For companies to implement and develop IoT services for smart cities they need to have incentives The governments play key roles in smart city projects as changes in policies will help cities to implement the IoT which provides effectiveness efficiency and accuracy of the resources that are being used For instance the government provides tax incentives and cheap rent improves public transports and offers an environment where startup companies creative industries and multinationals may cocreate share a common infrastructure and labor markets and take advantage of locally embedded technologies production process and transaction costs Military The Internet of Military Things IoMT is the application of IoT technologies in the military domain for the purposes of reconnaissance surveillance and other combatrelated objectives It is heavily influenced by the future prospects of warfare in an urban environment and involves the use of sensors munitions vehicles robots humanwearable biometrics and other smart technology that is relevant on the battlefield One of the examples of IOT devices used in the military is Xaver 1000 system The Xaver 1000 was developed by Israels Camero Tech which is the latest in the companys line of through wall imaging systems The Xaver line uses millimeter wave MMW radar or radar in the range of 30300 gigahertz It is equipped with an AIbased life target tracking system as well as its own 3D sensethroughthewall technology Internet of Battlefield Things The Internet of Battlefield Things IoBT is a project initiated and executed by the US Army Research Laboratory ARL that focuses on the basic science related to the IoT that enhance the capabilities of Army soldiers In 2017 ARL launched the Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative Research Alliance IoBTCRA establishing a working collaboration between industry university and Army researchers to advance the theoretical foundations of IoT technologies and their applications to Army operations Ocean of Things The Ocean of Things project is a DARPAled program designed to establish an Internet of things across large ocean areas for the purposes of collecting monitoring and analyzing environmental and vessel activity data The project entails the deployment of about 50000 floats that house a passive sensor suite that autonomously detect and track military and commercial vessels as part of a cloudbased network Product digitalization There are several applications of smart or active packaging in which a QR code or NFC tag is affixed on a product or its packaging The tag itself is passive however it contains a unique identifier typically a URL which enables a user to access digital content about the product via a smartphone Strictly speaking such passive items are not part of the Internet of things but they can be seen as enablers of digital interactions The term Internet of Packaging has been coined to describe applications in which unique identifiers are used to automate supply chains and are scanned on large scale by consumers to access digital content Authentication of the unique identifiers and thereby of the product itself is possible via a copysensitive digital watermark or copy detection pattern for scanning when scanning a QR code while NFC tags can encrypt communication Trends and characteristics The IoTs major significant trend in recent years is the growth of devices connected and controlled via the Internet The wide range of applications for IoT technology mean that the specifics can be very different from one device to the next but there are basic characteristics shared by most The IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems resulting in efficiency improvements economic benefits and reduced human exertions IoT Analytics reported there were 166 billion IoT devices connected in 2023 In 2020 the same firm projected there would be 30 billion devices connected by 2025 As of October 2024 there are around 17 billion Intelligence Ambient intelligence and autonomous control are not part of the original concept of the Internet of things Ambient intelligence and autonomous control do not necessarily require Internet structures either However there is a shift in research by companies such as Intel to integrate the concepts of the IoT and autonomous control with initial outcomes towards this direction considering objects as the driving force for autonomous IoT An approach in this context is deep reinforcement learning where most of IoT systems provide a dynamic and interactive environment Training an agent ie IoT device to behave smartly in such an environment cannot be addressed by conventional machine learning algorithms such as supervised learning By reinforcement learning approach a learning agent can sense the environments state eg sensing home temperature perform actions eg turn HVAC on or off and learn through the maximizing accumulated rewards it receives in long term IoT intelligence can be offered at three levels IoT devices EdgeFog nodes and cloud computing The need for intelligent control and decision at each level depends on the time sensitiveness of the IoT application For example an autonomous vehicles camera needs to make realtime obstacle detection to avoid an accident This fast decision making would not be possible through transferring data from the vehicle to cloud instances and return the predictions back to the vehicle Instead all the operation should be performed locally in the vehicle Integrating advanced machine learning algorithms including deep learning into IoT devices is an active research area to make smart objects closer to reality Moreover it is possible to get the most value out of IoT deployments through analyzing IoT data extracting hidden information and predicting control decisions A wide variety of machine learning techniques have been used in IoT domain ranging from traditional methods such as regression support vector machine and random forest to advanced ones such as convolutional neural networks LSTM and variational autoencoder In the future the Internet of things may be a nondeterministic and open network in which autoorganized or intelligent entities web services SOA components and virtual objects avatars will be interoperable and able to act independently pursuing their own objectives or shared ones depending on the context circumstances or environments Autonomous behavior through the collection and reasoning of context information as well as the objects ability to detect changes in the environment faults affecting sensors and introduce suitable mitigation measures constitutes a major research trend clearly needed to provide credibility to the IoT technology Modern IoT products and solutions in the marketplace use a variety of different technologies to support such contextaware automation but more sophisticated forms of intelligence are requested to permit sensor units and intelligent cyberphysical systems to be deployed in real environments Architecture IoT system architecture in its simplistic view consists of three tiers Tier 1 Devices Tier 2 the Edge Gateway and Tier 3 the Cloud Devices include networked things such as the sensors and actuators found in IoT equipment particularly those that use protocols such as Modbus Bluetooth Zigbee or proprietary protocols to connect to an Edge Gateway The Edge Gateway layer consists of sensor data aggregation systems called Edge Gateways that provide functionality such as preprocessing of the data securing connectivity to cloud using systems such as WebSockets the event hub and even in some cases edge analytics or fog computing Edge Gateway layer is also required to give a common view of the devices to the upper layers to facilitate in easier management The final tier includes the cloud application built for IoT using the microservices architecture which are usually polyglot and inherently secure in nature using HTTPSOAuth It includes various database systems that store sensor data such as time series databases or asset stores using backend data storage systems eg Cassandra PostgreSQL The cloud tier in most cloudbased IoT system features event queuing and messaging system that handles communication that transpires in all tiers Some experts classified the threetiers in the IoT system as edge platform and enterprise and these are connected by proximity network access network and service network respectively Building on the Internet of things the web of things is an architecture for the application layer of the Internet of things looking at the convergence of data from IoT devices into Web applications to create innovative usecases In order to program and control the flow of information in the Internet of things a predicted architectural direction is being called BPM Everywhere which is a blending of traditional process management with process mining and special capabilities to automate the control of large numbers of coordinated devices Network architecture The Internet of things requires huge scalability in the network space to handle the surge of devices IETF 6LoWPAN can be used to connect devices to IP networks With billions of devices being added to the Internet space IPv6 will play a major role in handling the network layer scalability IETFs Constrained Application Protocol ZeroMQ and MQTT can provide lightweight data transport In practice many groups of IoT devices are hidden behind gateway nodes and may not have unique addresses Also the vision of everythinginterconnected is not needed for most applications as it is mainly the data which need interconnecting at a higher layer Fog computing is a viable alternative to prevent such a large burst of data flow through the Internet The edge devices computation power to analyze and process data is extremely limited Limited processing power is a key attribute of IoT devices as their purpose is to supply data about physical objects while remaining autonomous Heavy processing requirements use more battery power harming IoTs ability to operate Scalability is easy because IoT devices simply supply data through the internet to a server with sufficient processing power Decentralized IoT Decentralized Internet of things or decentralized IoT is a modified IoT which utilizes fog computing to handle and balance requests of connected IoT devices in order to reduce loading on the cloud servers and improve responsiveness for latencysensitive IoT applications like vital signs monitoring of patients vehicletovehicle communication of autonomous driving and critical failure detection of industrial devices Performance is improved especially for huge IoT systems with millions of nodes Conventional IoT is connected via a mesh network and led by a major head node centralized controller The head node decides how a data is created stored and transmitted In contrast decentralized IoT attempts to divide IoT systems into smaller divisions The head node authorizes partial decisionmaking power to lower level subnodes under mutual agreed policy Some approached to decentralized IoT attempts to address the limited bandwidth and hashing capacity of battery powered or wireless IoT devices via blockchain Complexity In semiopen or closed loops ie value chains whenever a global finality can be settled the IoT will often be considered and studied as a complex system due to the huge number of different links interactions between autonomous actors and its capacity to integrate new actors At the overall stage full open loop it will likely be seen as a chaotic environment since systems always have finality As a practical approach not all elements on the Internet of things run in a global public space Subsystems are often implemented to mitigate the risks of privacy control and reliability For example domestic robotics domotics running inside a smart home might only share data within and be available via a local network Managing and controlling a high dynamic ad hoc IoT thingsdevices network is a tough task with the traditional networks architecture Software Defined Networking SDN provides the agile dynamic solution that can cope with the special requirements of the diversity of innovative IoT applications Size considerations The exact scale of the Internet of things is unknown with quotes of billions or trillions often quoted at the beginning of IoT articles In 2015 there were 83 million smart devices in peoples homes This number is expected to grow to 193 million devices by 2020 The figure of online capable devices grew 31 from 2016 to 2017 to reach 84 billion Space considerations In the Internet of things the precise geographic location of a thingand also the precise geographic dimensions of a thingcan be critical Therefore facts about a thing such as its location in time and space have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can decide whether or not that information was important to the action being taken and if so add the missing information or decide to not take the action Note that some things on the Internet of things will be sensors and sensor location is usually important The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location However the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales the need to handle massive amounts of data and an indexing for fast search and neighbour operations On the Internet of things if things are able to take actions on their own initiative this humancentric mediation role is eliminated Thus the timespace context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem Just as standards play a key role on the Internet and the Web geospatial standards will play a key role on the Internet of things A solution to basket of remotes Many IoT devices have the potential to take a piece of this market JeanLouis Gasse Apple initial alumni team and BeOS cofounder has addressed this topic in an article on Monday Note where he predicts that the most likely problem will be what he calls the basket of remotes problem where well have hundreds of applications to interface with hundreds of devices that dont share protocols for speaking with one another For improved user interaction some technology leaders are joining forces to create standards for communication between devices to solve this problem Others are turning to the concept of predictive interaction of devices where collected data is used to predict and trigger actions on the specific devices while making them work together Social Internet of things Social Internet of things SIoT is a new kind of IoT that focuses the importance of social interaction and relationship between IoT devices SIoT is a pattern of how crossdomain IoT devices enabling application to application communication and collaboration without human intervention in order to serve their owners with autonomous services and this only can be realized when gained lowlevel architecture support from both IoT software and hardware engineering Social Network for IoT Devices Not Human IoT defines a device with an identity like a citizen in a community and connect them to the internet to provide services to its users SIoT defines a social network for IoT devices only to interact with each other for different goals that to serve human How is SIoT different from IoT SIoT is different from the original IoT in terms of the collaboration characteristics IoT is passive it was set to serve for dedicated purposes with existing IoT devices in predetermined system SIoT is active it was programmed and managed by AI to serve for unplanned purposes with mix and match of potential IoT devices from different systems that benefit its users How does SIoT Work IoT devices builtin with sociability will broadcast their abilities or functionalities and at the same time discovers shares information monitors navigates and groups with other IoT devices in the same or nearby network realizing SIoT and facilitating useful service compositions in order to help its users proactively in every days life especially during emergency Social IoT Examples IoTbased smart home technology monitors health data of patients or aging adults by analyzing their physiological parameters and prompt the nearby health facilities when emergency medical services needed In case emergency automatically ambulance of a nearest available hospital will be called with pickup location provided ward assigned patients health data will be transmitted to the emergency department and display on the doctors computer immediately for further action IoT sensors on the vehicles road and traffic lights monitor the conditions of the vehicles and drivers and alert when attention needed and also coordinate themselves automatically to ensure autonomous driving is working normally Unfortunately if an accident happens IoT camera will inform the nearest hospital and police station for help Social IoT Challenges Internet of things is multifaceted and complicated One of the main factors that hindering people from adopting and use Internet of things IoT based products and services is its complexity Installation and setup is a challenge to people therefore there is a need for IoT devices to mix match and configure themselves automatically to provide different services at different situation System security always a concern for any technology and it is more crucial for SIoT as not only security of oneself need to be considered but also the mutual trust mechanism between collaborative IoT devices from time to time from place to place Another critical challenge for SIoT is the accuracy and reliability of the sensors At most of the circumstances IoT sensors would need to respond in nanoseconds to avoid accidents injury and loss of life Enabling technologies There are many technologies that enable the IoT Crucial to the field is the network used to communicate between devices of an IoT installation a role that several wireless or wired technologies may fulfill Addressability The original idea of the AutoID Center is based on RFIDtags and distinct identification through the Electronic Product Code This has evolved into objects having an IP address or URI An alternative view from the world of the Semantic Web focuses instead on making all things not just those electronic smart or RFIDenabled addressable by the existing naming protocols such as URI The objects themselves do not converse but they may now be referred to by other agents such as powerful centralised servers acting for their human owners Integration with the Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a distinct identifier Due to the limited address space of IPv4 which allows for 43 billion different addresses objects in the IoT will have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol IPv6 to scale to the extremely large address space required Internetofthings devices additionally will benefit from the stateless address autoconfiguration present in IPv6 as it reduces the configuration overhead on the hosts and the IETF 6LoWPAN header compression To a large extent the future of the Internet of things will not be possible without the support of IPv6 and consequently the global adoption of IPv6 in the coming years will be critical for the successful development of the IoT in the future Application Layer ADRC defines an application layer protocol and supporting framework for implementing IoT applications Shortrange wireless Bluetooth mesh networking

fiber optic links in conjunction with hubs or switches Powerline communication PLC Communication technology using electrical wiring to carry power and data Specifications such as HomePlug or Ghn utilize PLC for networking IoT devices Comparison of technologies by layer Different technologies have different roles in a protocol stack Below is a simplified presentation of the roles of several popular communication technologies in IoT applications Standards and standards organizations This is a list of technical standards for the IoT most of which are open standards and the standards organizations that aspire to successfully setting them Politics and civic engagement Some scholars and activists argue that the IoT can be used to create new models of civic engagement if device networks can be open to user control and interoperable platforms Philip N Howard a professor and author writes that political life in both democracies and authoritarian regimes will be shaped by the way the IoT will be used for civic engagement For that to happen he argues that any connected device should be able to divulge a list of the ultimate beneficiaries of its sensor data and that individual citizens should be able to add new organisations to the beneficiary list In addition he argues that civil society groups need to start developing their IoT strategy for making use of data and engaging with the public Government regulation One of the key drivers of the IoT is data The success of the idea of connecting devices to make them more efficient is dependent upon access to and storage processing of data For this purpose companies working on the IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their cloud network for further processing This leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems The other issues pertain to consumer choice and ownership of data and how it is used Though still in their infancy regulations and governance regarding these issues of privacy security and data ownership continue to develop IoT regulation depends on the country Some examples of legislation that is relevant to privacy and data collection are the US Privacy Act of 1974 OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data of 1980 and the EU Directive 9546EC of 1995 Current regulatory environment A report published by the Federal Trade Commission FTC in January 2015 made the following three recommendations Data security At the time of designing IoT companies should ensure that data collection storage and processing would be secure at all times Companies should adopt a defense in depth approach and encrypt data at each stage Data consent users should have a choice as to what data they share with IoT companies and the users must be informed if their data gets exposed Data minimisation IoT companies should collect only the data they need and retain the collected information only for a limited time However the FTC stopped at just making recommendations for now According to an FTC analysis the existing framework consisting of the FTC Act the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act along with developing consumer education and business guidance participation in multistakeholder efforts and advocacy to other agencies at the federal state and local level is sufficient to protect consumer rights A resolution passed by the Senate in March 2015 is already being considered by the Congress This resolution recognized the need for formulating a National Policy on IoT and the matter of privacy security and spectrum Furthermore to provide an impetus to the IoT ecosystem in March 2016 a bipartisan group of four Senators proposed a bill The Developing Innovation and Growing the Internet of Things DIGIT Act to direct the Federal Communications Commission to assess the need for more spectrum to connect IoT devices Approved on 28 September 2018 California Senate Bill No 327 goes into effect on 1 January 2020 The bill requires a manufacturer of a connected device as those terms are defined to equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features that are appropriate to the nature and function of the device appropriate to the information it may collect contain or transmit and designed to protect the device and any information contained therein from unauthorized access destruction use modification or disclosure Several standards for the IoT industry are actually being established relating to automobiles because most concerns arising from use of connected cars apply to healthcare devices as well In fact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA is preparing cybersecurity guidelines and a database of best practices to make automotive computer systems more secure A recent report from the World Bank examines the challenges and opportunities in government adoption of IoT These include Still early days for the IoT in government Underdeveloped policy and regulatory frameworks Unclear business models despite strong value proposition Clear institutional and capacity gap in government AND the private sector Inconsistent data valuation and management Infrastructure a major barrier Government as an enabler Most successful pilots share common characteristics publicprivate partnership local leadership In early December 2021 the UK government introduced the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure bill PST an effort to legislate IoT distributors manufacturers and importers to meet certain cybersecurity standards The bill also seeks to improve the security credentials of consumer IoT devices Criticism problems and controversies Platform fragmentation The IoT suffers from platform fragmentation lack of interoperability and common technical standards a situation where the variety of IoT devices in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them makes the task of developing applications that work consistently between different inconsistent technology ecosystems hard For example wireless connectivity for IoT devices can be done using Bluetooth WiFi WiFi HaLow Zigbee ZWave LoRa NBIoT Cat M1 as well as completely custom proprietary radios each with its own advantages and disadvantages and unique support ecosystem The IoTs amorphous computing nature is also a problem for security since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lowerprice devices One set of researchers says that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87 of active Android devices vulnerable Privacy autonomy and control Philip N Howard a professor and author writes that the Internet of things offers immense potential for empowering citizens making government transparent and broadening information access Howard cautions however that privacy threats are enormous as is the potential for social control and political manipulation Concerns about privacy have led many to consider the possibility that big data infrastructures such as the Internet of things and data mining are inherently incompatible with privacy Key challenges of increased digitalization in the water transport or energy sector are related to privacy and cybersecurity which necessitate an adequate response from research and policymakers alike Writer Adam Greenfield claims that IoT technologies are not only an invasion of public space but are also being used to perpetuate normative behavior citing an instance of billboards with hidden cameras that tracked the demographics of passersby who stopped to read the advertisement The Internet of Things Council compared the increased prevalence of digital surveillance due to the Internet of things to the concept of the panopticon described by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century The assertion is supported by the works of French philosophers Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze In Discipline and Punish The Birth of the Prison Foucault asserts that the panopticon was a central element of the discipline society developed during the Industrial Era Foucault also argued that the discipline systems established in factories and school reflected Benthams vision of panopticism In his 1992 paper Postscripts on the Societies of Control Deleuze wrote that the discipline society had transitioned into a control society with the computer replacing the panopticon as an instrument of discipline and control while still maintaining the qualities similar to that of panopticism PeterPaul Verbeek a professor of philosophy of technology at the University of Twente Netherlands writes that technology already influences our moral decision making which in turn affects human agency privacy and autonomy He cautions against viewing technology merely as a human tool and advocates instead to consider it as an active agent Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and Technology expressed concern regarding the impact of the IoT on consumer privacy saying that There are some people in the commercial space who say Oh big data well lets collect everything keep it around forever well pay for somebody to think about security later The question is whether we want to have some sort of policy framework in place to limit that Tim OReilly believes that the way companies sell the IoT devices on consumers are misplaced disputing the notion that the IoT is about gaining efficiency from putting all kinds of devices online and postulating that the IoT is really about human augmentation The applications are profoundly different when you have sensors and data driving the decisionmaking Editorials at WIRED have also expressed concern one stating What youre about to lose is your privacy Actually its worse than that You arent just going to lose your privacy youre going to have to watch the very concept of privacy be rewritten under your nose The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU expressed concern regarding the ability of IoT to erode peoples control over their own lives The ACLU wrote that Theres simply no way to forecast how these immense powers disproportionately accumulating in the hands of corporations seeking financial advantage and governments craving ever more control will be used Chances are big data and the Internet of Things will make it harder for us to control our own lives as we grow increasingly transparent to powerful corporations and government institutions that are becoming more opaque to us In response to rising concerns about privacy and smart technology in 2007 the British Government stated it would follow formal Privacy by Design principles when implementing their smart metering program The program would lead to replacement of traditional power meters with smart power meters which could track and manage energy usage more accurately However the British Computer Society is doubtful these principles were ever actually implemented In 2009 the Dutch Parliament rejected a similar smart metering program basing their decision on privacy concerns The Dutch program later revised and passed in 2011 Data storage A challenge for producers of IoT applications is to clean process and interpret the vast amount of data which is gathered by the sensors There is a solution proposed for the analytics of the information referred to as Wireless Sensor Networks These networks share data among sensor nodes that are sent to a distributed system for the analytics of the sensory data Another challenge is the storage of this bulk data Depending on the application there could be high data acquisition requirements which in turn lead to high storage requirements In 2013 the Internet was estimated to be responsible for consuming 5 of the total energy produced and a daunting challenge to power IoT devices to collect and even store data still remains Data silos although a common challenge of legacy systems still commonly occur with the implementation of IoT devices particularly within manufacturing As there are a lot of benefits to be gained from IoT and IIoT devices the means in which the data is stored can present serious challenges without the principles of autonomy transparency and interoperability being considered The challenges do not occur by the device itself but the means in which databases and data warehouses are setup These challenges were commonly identified in manufactures and enterprises which have begun upon digital transformation and are part of the digital foundation indicating that in order to receive the optimal benefits from IoT devices and for decision making enterprises will have to first realign their data storing methods These challenges were identified by Keller 2021 when investigating the IT and application landscape of I40 implementation within German ME manufactures Security Security is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology with concerns that rapid development is happening without appropriate consideration of the profound security challenges involved and the regulatory changes that might be necessary The rapid development of the Internet of Things IoT has allowed billions of devices to connect to the network Due to too many connected devices and the limitation of communication security technology various security issues gradually appear in the IoT Most of the technical security concerns are similar to those of conventional servers workstations and smartphones These concerns include using weak authentication forgetting to change default credentials unencrypted messages sent between devices SQL injections maninthemiddle attacks and poor handling of security updates However many IoT devices have severe operational limitations on the computational power available to them These constraints often make them unable to directly use basic security measures such as implementing firewalls or using strong cryptosystems to encrypt their communications with other devices and the low price and consumer focus of many devices makes a robust security patching system uncommon Rather than conventional security vulnerabilities fault injection attacks are on the rise and targeting IoT devices A fault injection attack is a physical attack on a device to purposefully introduce faults in the system to change the intended behavior Faults might happen unintentionally by environmental noises and electromagnetic fields There are ideas stemmed from controlflow integrity CFI to prevent fault injection attacks and system recovery to a healthy state before the fault Internet of things devices also have access to new areas of data and can often control physical devices so that even by 2014 it was possible to say that many Internetconnected appliances could already spy on people in their own homes including televisions kitchen appliances cameras and thermostats Computercontrolled devices in automobiles such as brakes engine locks hood and trunk releases horn heat and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the onboard network In some cases vehicle computer systems are Internetconnected allowing them to be exploited remotely By 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority Later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps and implantable cardioverter defibrillators Poorly secured Internetaccessible IoT devices can also be subverted to attack others In 2016 a distributed denial of service attack powered by Internet of things devices running the Mirai malware took down a DNS provider and major web sites The Mirai Botnet had infected roughly 65000 IoT devices within the first 20 hours Eventually the infections increased to around 200000 to 300000 infections Brazil Colombia and Vietnam made up of 415 of the infections The Mirai Botnet had singled out specific IoT devices that consisted of DVRs IP cameras routers and printers Top vendors that contained the most infected devices were identified as Dahua Huawei ZTE Cisco ZyXEL and MikroTik In May 2017 Junade Ali a computer scientist at Cloudflare noted that native DDoS vulnerabilities exist in IoT devices due to a poor implementation of the Publishsubscribe pattern These sorts of attacks have caused security experts to view IoT as a real threat to Internet services The US National Intelligence Council in an unclassified report maintains that it would be hard to deny access to networks of sensors and remotelycontrolled objects by enemies of the United States criminals and mischief makers An open market for aggregated sensor data could serve the interests of commerce and security no less than it helps criminals and spies identify vulnerable targets Thus massively parallel sensor fusion may undermine social cohesion if it proves to be fundamentally incompatible with FourthAmendment guarantees against unreasonable search In general the intelligence community views the Internet of things as a rich source of data On 31 January 2019 The Washington Post wrote an article regarding the security and ethical challenges that can occur with IoT doorbells and cameras Last month Ring got caught allowing its team in Ukraine to view and annotate certain user videos the company says it only looks at publicly shared videos and those from Ring owners who provide consent Just last week a California familys Nest camera let a hacker take over and broadcast fake audio warnings about a missile attack not to mention peer in on them when they used a weak password There have been a range of responses to concerns over security The Internet of Things Security Foundation IoTSF was launched on 23 September 2015 with a mission to secure the Internet of things by promoting knowledge and best practice Its founding board is made from technology providers and telecommunications companies In addition large IT companies are continually developing innovative solutions to ensure the security of IoT devices In 2017 Mozilla launched Project Things which allows to route IoT devices through a safe Web of Things gateway As per the estimates from KBV Research the overall IoT security market would grow at 279 rate during 20162022 as a result of growing infrastructural concerns and diversified usage of Internet of things Governmental regulation is argued by some to be necessary to secure IoT devices and the wider Internet as market incentives to secure IoT devices is insufficient It was found that due to the nature of most of the IoT development boards they generate predictable and weak keys which make it easy to be utilized by maninthemiddle attack However various hardening approaches were proposed by many researchers to resolve the issue of SSH weak implementation and weak keys IoT security within the field of manufacturing presents different challenges and varying perspectives Within the EU and Germany data protection is constantly referenced throughout manufacturing and digital policy particularly that of I40 However the attitude towards data security differs from the enterprise perspective whereas there is an emphasis on less data protection in the form of GDPR as the data being collected from IoT devices in the manufacturing sector does not display personal details Yet research has indicated that manufacturing experts are concerned about data security for protecting machine technology from international competitors with the evergreater push for interconnectivity Safety IoT systems are typically controlled by eventdriven smart apps that take as input either sensed data user inputs or other external triggers from the Internet and command one or more actuators towards providing different forms of automation Examples of sensors include smoke detectors motion sensors and contact sensors Examples of actuators include smart locks smart power outlets and door controls Popular control platforms on which thirdparty developers can build smart apps that interact wirelessly with these sensors and actuators include Samsungs SmartThings Apples HomeKit and Amazons Alexa among others A problem specific to IoT systems is that buggy apps unforeseen bad app interactions or devicecommunication failures can cause unsafe and dangerous physical states eg unlock the entrance door when no one is at home or turn off the heater when the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius and people are sleeping at night Detecting flaws that lead to such states requires a holistic view of installed apps component devices their configurations and more importantly how they interact Recently researchers from the University of California Riverside have proposed IotSan a novel practical system that uses model checking as a building block to reveal interactionlevel flaws by identifying events that can lead the system to unsafe states They have evaluated IotSan on the Samsung SmartThings platform From 76 manually configured systems IotSan detects 147 vulnerabilities ie violations of safe physical statesproperties Design Given widespread recognition of the evolving nature of the design and management of the Internet of things sustainable and secure deployment of IoT solutions must design for anarchic scalability Application of the concept of anarchic scalability can be extended to physical systems ie controlled realworld objects by virtue of those systems being designed to account for uncertain management futures This hard anarchic scalability thus provides a pathway forward to fully realize the potential of Internetofthings solutions by selectively constraining physical systems to allow for all management regimes without risking physical failure Brown University computer scientist Michael Littman has argued that successful execution of the Internet of things requires consideration of the interfaces usability as well as the technology itself These interfaces need to be not only more userfriendly but also better integrated If users need to learn different interfaces for their vacuums their locks their sprinklers their lights and their coffeemakers its tough to say that their lives have been made any easier Environmental sustainability impact A concern regarding Internetofthings technologies pertains to the environmental impacts of the manufacture use and eventual disposal of all these semiconductorrich devices Modern electronics are replete with a wide variety of heavy metals and rareearth metals as well as highly toxic synthetic chemicals This makes them extremely difficult to properly recycle Electronic components are often incinerated or placed in regular landfills Furthermore the human and environmental cost of mining the rareearth metals that are integral to modern electronic components continues to grow This leads to societal questions concerning the environmental impacts of IoT devices over their lifetime Intentional obsolescence of devices The Electronic Frontier Foundation has raised concerns that companies can use the technologies necessary to support connected devices to intentionally disable or brick their customers devices via a remote software update or by disabling a service necessary to the operation of the device In one example home automation devices sold with the promise of a Lifetime Subscription were rendered useless after Nest Labs acquired Revolv and made the decision to shut down the central servers the Revolv devices had used to operate As Nest is a company owned by Alphabet Googles parent company the EFF argues this sets a terrible precedent for a company with ambitions to sell selfdriving cars medical devices and other highend gadgets that may be essential to a persons livelihood or physical safety Owners should be free to point their devices to a different server or collaborate on improved software But such action violates the United States DMCA section 1201 which only has an exemption for local use This forces tinkerers who want to keep using their own equipment into a legal grey area EFF thinks buyers should refuse electronics and software that prioritize the manufacturers wishes above their own Examples of postsale manipulations include Google Nest Revolv disabled privacy settings on Android Sony disabling Linux on PlayStation 3 and enforced EULA on Wii U Confusing terminology Kevin Lonergan at Information Age a business technology magazine has referred to the terms surrounding the IoT as a terminology zoo The lack of clear terminology is not useful from a practical point of view and a source of confusion for the end user A company operating in the IoT space could be working in anything related to sensor technology networking embedded systems or analytics According to Lonergan the term IoT was coined before smart phones tablets and devices as we know them today existed and there is a long list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological convergence Internet of things Internet of everything IoE Internet of goods supply chain industrial Internet pervasive computing pervasive sensing ubiquitous computing cyberphysical systems CPS wireless sensor networks WSN smart objects digital twin cyberobjects or avatars cooperating objects machine to machine M2M ambient intelligence AmI Operational technology OT and information technology IT Regarding IIoT an industrial subfield of IoT the Industrial Internet Consortiums Vocabulary Task Group has created a common and reusable vocabulary of terms to ensure consistent terminology across publications issued by the Industrial Internet Consortium IoT One has created an IoT Terms Database including a New Term Alert to be notified when a new term is published As of March 2020 this database aggregates 807 IoTrelated terms while keeping material transparent and comprehensive Adoption barriers Lack of interoperability and unclear value propositions Despite a shared belief in the potential of the IoT industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely Mike Farley argued in Forbes that while IoT solutions appeal to early adopters they either lack interoperability or a clear use case for endusers A study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish companies suggests that many struggle to pinpoint exactly where the value of IoT lies for them Privacy and security concerns As for IoT especially in regards to consumer IoT information about a users daily routine is collected so that the things around the user can cooperate to provide better services that fulfill personal preference When the collected information which describes a user in detail travels through multiple hops in a network due to a diverse integration of services devices and network the information stored on a device is vulnerable to privacy violation by compromising nodes existing in an IoT network For example on 21 October 2016 a multiple distributed denial of service DDoS attacks systems operated by domain name system provider Dyn which caused the inaccessibility of several websites such as GitHub Twitter and others This attack is executed through a botnet consisting of a large number of IoT devices including IP cameras gateways and even baby monitors Fundamentally there are 4 security objectives that the IoT system requires 1 data confidentiality unauthorised parties cannot have access to the transmitted and stored data 2 data integrity intentional and unintentional corruption of transmitted and stored data must be detected 3 nonrepudiation the sender cannot deny having sent a given message 4 data availability the transmitted and stored data should be available to authorised parties even with the denialofservice DOS attacks Information privacy regulations also require organisations to practice reasonable security Californias SB327 Information privacy connected devices would require a manufacturer of a connected device as those terms are defined to equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features that are appropriate to the nature and function of the device appropriate to the information it may collect contain or transmit and designed to protect the device and any information contained therein from unauthorised access destruction use modification or disclosure as specified As each organisations environment is unique it can prove challenging to demonstrate what reasonable security is and what potential risks could be involved for the business Oregons HB2395 also requires a person that manufactures sells or offers to sell connected device manufacturer to equip connected device with reasonable security features that protect connected device and information that connected device collects contains stores or transmits stores from access destruction modification use or disclosure that consumer does not authorise According to antivirus provider Kaspersky there were 639 million data breaches of IoT devices in 2020 and 15 billion breaches in the first six months of 2021 Traditional governance structure A study issued by Ericsson regarding the adoption of Internet of things among Danish companies identified a clash between IoT and companies traditional governance structures as IoT still presents both uncertainties and a lack of historical precedence Among the respondents interviewed 60 percent stated that they do not believe they have the organizational capabilities and three of four do not believe they have the processes needed to capture the IoT opportunity This has led to a need to understand organizational culture in order to facilitate organizational design processes and to test new innovation management practices A lack of digital leadership in the age of digital transformation has also stifled innovation and IoT adoption to a degree that many companies in the face of uncertainty were waiting for the market dynamics to play out or further action in regards to IoT was pending competitor moves customer pull or regulatory requirements Some of these companies risk being kodaked Kodak was a market leader until digital disruption eclipsed film photography with digital photos failing to see the disruptive forces affecting their industry and to truly embrace the new business models the disruptive change opens up Scott Anthony has written in Harvard Business Review that Kodak created a digital camera invested in the technology and even understood that photos would be shared online but ultimately failed to realize that online photo sharing was the new business not just a way to expand the printing business Business planning and project management According to 2018 study 7075 of IoT deployments were stuck in the pilot or prototype stage unable to reach scale due in part to a lack of business planning Even though scientists engineers and managers across the world are continuously working to create and exploit the benefits of IoT products there are some flaws in the governance management and implementation of such projects Despite tremendous forward momentum in the field of information and other underlying technologies IoT still remains a complex area and the problem of how IoT projects are managed still needs to be addressed IoT projects must be run differently than simple and traditional IT manufacturing or construction projects Because IoT projects have longer project timelines a lack of skilled resources and several securitylegal issues there is a need for new and specifically designed project processes The following management techniques should improve the success rate of IoT projects A separate research and development phase A ProofofConceptPrototype before the actual project begins Project managers with interdisciplinary technical knowledge

    title: "Smartphones",
    originalContent:
      "A smartphone often simply called a phone is a mobile device that combines the functionality of a traditional mobile phone with advanced computing capabilities It typically has a touchscreen interface allowing users to access a wide range of applications and services such as web browsing email and social media as well as multimedia playback and streaming Smartphones have builtin cameras GPS navigation and support for various communication methods including voice calls text messaging and internetbased messaging apps Smartphones are distinguished from olderdesign feature phones by their more advanced hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems access to the internet business applications mobile payments and multimedia functionality including music video gaming radio and television Smartphones typically feature metaloxidesemiconductor MOS integrated circuit IC chips various sensors and support for multiple wireless communication protocols These devices leverage sensors such as accelerometers barometers gyroscopes and magnetometers which can be used by both preinstalled and thirdparty software to enhance functionality In addition smartphones are equipped to support a variety of wireless communication standards including LTE 5G NR WiFi Bluetooth and satellite navigation By the mid2020s manufacturers began integrating satellite messaging and emergency services expanding their utility in remote areas without reliable cellular coverage Following the rising popularity of the iPhone in the late 2000s the majority of smartphones have featured thin slatelike form factors with large capacitive touch screens with support for multitouch gestures rather than physical keyboards Most modern smartphones have the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a centralized app store They often have support for cloud storage and cloud synchronization and virtual assistants Smartphones have largely replaced personal digital assistant PDA devices handheldpalmsized PCs portable media players PMP pointandshoot cameras camcorders and to a lesser extent handheld video game consoles ereader devices pocket calculators and GPS tracking units Since the early 2010s improved hardware and faster wireless communication have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry As of 2014 over a billion smartphones are sold globally every year In 2019 alone 154 billion smartphone units were shipped worldwide 7505 percent of the world population were smartphone users as of 2020 History Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone PDA devices with support for cellular telephony but were limited by their bulky form short battery life slow analog cellular networks and the immaturity of wireless data services These issues were eventually resolved with the exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS transistors down to submicron levels Moores law the improved lithiumion battery faster digital mobile data networks Edholms law and more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers In the 2000s NTT DoCoMos imode platform BlackBerry Nokias Symbian platform and Windows Mobile began to gain market traction with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards or resistive touchscreen input and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet Forerunner In the early 1990s IBM engineer Frank Canova realised that chipandwireless technology was becoming small enough to use in handheld devices The first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a smartphone began as a prototype called Angler developed by Canova in 1992 while at IBM and demonstrated in November of that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show A refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator In addition to placing and receiving cellular calls the touchscreenequipped Simon could send and receive faxes and emails It included an address book calendar appointment scheduler calculator world time clock and notepad as well as other visionary mobile applications such as maps stock reports and news The IBM Simon was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric which integrated features with its own cellular radio technologies It featured a liquidcrystal display LCD and PC Card support The Simon was commercially unsuccessful particularly due to its bulky form factor and limited battery life using NiCad batteries rather than the nickelmetal hydride batteries commonly used in mobile phones in the 1990s or lithiumion batteries used in modern smartphones The term smart phone in two words was not coined until a year after the introduction of the Simon appearing in print as early as 1995 describing ATTs PhoneWriter Communicator The term smartphone as one word was first used by Ericsson in 1997 to describe a new device concept the GS88 PDAphone hybrids Beginning in the midtolate 1990s many people who had mobile phones carried a separate dedicated PDA device running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS Newton OS Symbian or Windows CEPocket PC These operating systems would later evolve into early mobile operating systems Most of the smartphones in this era were hybrid devices that combined these existing familiar PDA OSes with basic phone hardware The results were devices that were bulkier than either dedicated mobile phones or PDAs but allowed a limited amount of cellular Internet access PDA and mobile phone manufacturers competed in reducing the size of devices The bulk of these smartphones combined with their high cost and expensive data plans plus other drawbacks such as expansion limitations and decreased battery life compared to separate standalone devices generally limited their popularity to early adopters and business users who needed portable connectivity In March 1996 HewlettPackard released the OmniGo 700LX a modified HP 200LX palmtop PC with a Nokia 2110 mobile phone piggybacked onto it and ROMbased software to support it It had a 640 200 resolution CGA compatible fourshade grayscale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls and to create and receive text messages emails and faxes It was also 100 DOS 50 compatible allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles including early versions of Windows In August 1996 Nokia released the Nokia 9000 Communicator a digital cellular PDA based on the Nokia 2110 with an integrated system based on the PENGEOS 30 operating system from Geoworks The two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design with the display above and a physical QWERTY keyboard below The PDA provided email calendar address book calculator and notebook applications textbased Web browsing and could send and receive faxes When closed the device could be used as a digital cellular telephone In June 1999 Qualcomm released the pdQ Smartphone a CDMA digital PCS smartphone with an integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity Subsequent landmark devices included The Ericsson R380 December 2000 by Ericsson Mobile Communications the first phone running the operating system later named Symbian it ran EPOC Release 5 which was renamed Symbian OS at Release 6 It had PDA functionality and limited Web browsing on a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus While it was marketed as a smartphone users could not install their own software on the device The Kyocera 6035 February 2001 a dualnature device with a separate Palm OS PDA operating system and CDMA mobile phone firmware It supported limited Web browsing with the PDA software treating the phone hardware as an attached modem The Nokia 9210 Communicator June 2001 the first phone running Symbian Release 6 with Nokias Series 80 platform v10 This was the first Symbian phone platform allowing the installation of additional applications Like the Nokia 9000 Communicator it is a large clamshell device with a full physical QWERTY keyboard inside Handsprings Treo 180 2002 the first smartphone that fully integrated the Palm OS on a GSM mobile phone having telephony SMS messaging and Internet access built into the OS The 180 model had a thumbtype keyboard and the 180g version had a Graffiti handwriting recognition area instead Japanese cell phones In 1999 Japanese wireless provider NTT DoCoMo launched imode a new mobile internet platform which provided data transmission speeds up to 96 kilobits per second and access web services available through the platform such as online shopping NTT DoCoMos imode used cHTML a language which restricted some aspects of traditional HTML in favor of increasing data speed for the devices Limited functionality small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available The rise of imode helped NTT DoCoMo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001 and ranked first in market capitalization in Japan and second globally Japanese cell phones increasingly diverged from global standards and trends to offer other forms of advanced services and smartphonelike functionality that were specifically tailored to the Japanese market such as mobile payments and shopping nearfield communication NFC allowing mobile wallet functionality to replace smart cards for transit fares loyalty cards identity cards event tickets coupons money transfer etc downloadable content like musical ringtones games and comics and 1seg mobile television Phones built by Japanese manufacturers used custom firmware however and did not yet feature standardized mobile operating systems designed to cater to thirdparty application development so their software and ecosystems were akin to very advanced feature phones As with other feature phones additional software and services required partnerships and deals with providers The degree of integration between phones and carriers unique phone features nonstandardized platforms and tailoring to Japanese culture made it difficult for Japanese manufacturers to export their phones especially when demand was so high in Japan that the companies did not feel the need to look elsewhere for additional profits The rise of 3G technology in other markets and nonJapanese phones with powerful standardized smartphone operating systems app stores and advanced wireless network capabilities allowed nonJapanese phone manufacturers to finally break in to the Japanese market gradually adopting Japanese phone features like emojis mobile payments NFC etc and spreading them to the rest of the world Early smartphones Phones that made effective use of any significant data connectivity were still rare outside Japan until the introduction of the Danger Hiptop in 2002 which saw moderate success among US consumers as the TMobile Sidekick Later in the mid2000s business users in the US started to adopt devices based on Microsofts Windows Mobile and then BlackBerry smartphones from Research In Motion American users popularized the term CrackBerry in 2006 due to the BlackBerrys addictive nature In the US the high cost of data plans and relative rarity of devices with WiFi capabilities that could avoid cellular data network usage kept adoption of smartphones mainly to business professionals and early adopters Outside the US and Japan Nokia was seeing success with its smartphones based on Symbian originally developed by Psion for their personal organisers and it was the most popular smartphone OS in Europe during the middle to late 2000s Initially Nokias Symbian smartphones were focused on business with the Eseries similar to Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices at the time From 2002 onwards Nokia started producing consumerfocused smartphones popularized by the entertainmentfocused Nseries Until 2010 Symbian was the worlds most widely used smartphone operating system The touchscreen personal digital assistant PDAderived nature of adapted operating systems like Palm OS the Pocket PC versions of what was later Windows Mobile and the UIQ interface that was originally designed for penbased PDAs on Symbian OS devices resulted in some early smartphones having stylusbased interfaces These allowed for virtual keyboards and handwriting input thus also allowing easy entry of Asian characters By the mid2000s the majority of smartphones had a physical QWERTY keyboard Most used a keyboard bar form factor like the BlackBerry line Windows Mobile smartphones Palm Treos and some of the Nokia Eseries A few hid their full physical QWERTY keyboard in a sliding form factor like the Danger Hiptop line Some even had only a numeric keypad using T9 text input like the Nokia Nseries and other models in the Nokia Eseries Resistive touchscreens with stylusbased interfaces could still be found on a few smartphones like the Palm Treos which had dropped their handwriting input after a few early models that were available in versions with Graffiti instead of a keyboard Form factor and operating system shifts The late 2000s and early 2010s saw a shift in smartphone interfaces away from devices with physical keyboards and keypads to ones with large fingeroperated capacitive touchscreens The first phone of any kind with a large capacitive touchscreen was the LG Prada announced by LG in December 2006 This was a fashionable feature phone created in collaboration with Italian luxury designer Prada with a 3 240 x 400 pixel screen a 2Megapixel digital camera with 144p video recording ability an LED flash and a miniature mirror for self portraits In January 2007 Apple Computer introduced the iPhone It had a 35 capacitive touchscreen with twice the common resolution of most smartphone screens at the time and introduced multitouch to phones which allowed gestures such as pinching to zoom in or out on photos maps and web pages The iPhone was notable as being the first device of its kind targeted at the mass market to abandon the use of a stylus keyboard or keypad typical of contemporary smartphones instead using a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction The iPhones operating system was also a shift away from older operating systems which older phones supported and which were adapted from PDAs and feature phones to an operative system powerful enough to not require using a limited stripped down web browser that can only render pages specially formatted using technologies such as WML cHTML or XHTML and instead ran a version of Apples Safari browser that could render full websites not specifically designed for mobile phones Later Apple shipped a software update that gave the iPhone a builtin ondevice App Store allowing direct wireless downloads of thirdparty software This kind of centralized App Store and free developer tools quickly became the new main paradigm for all smartphone platforms for software development distribution discovery installation and payment in place of expensive developer tools that required official approval to use and a dependence on thirdparty sources providing applications for multiple platforms The advantages of a design with software powerful enough to support advanced applications and a large capacitive touchscreen affected the development of another smartphone OS platform Android with a more BlackBerrylike prototype device scrapped in favor of a touchscreen device with a slideout physical keyboard as Googles engineers thought at the time that a touchscreen could not completely replace a physical keyboard and buttons Android is based around a modified Linux kernel again providing more power than mobile operating systems adapted from PDAs and feature phones The first Android device the horizontalsliding HTC Dream was released in September 2008 In 2012 Asus started experimenting with a convertible docking system named PadFone where the standalone handset can when necessary be inserted into a tabletsized screen unit with integrated supportive battery and used as such In 2013 and 2014 Samsung experimented with the hybrid combination of compact camera and smartphone releasing the Galaxy S4 Zoom and K Zoom each equipped with integrated 10 optical zoom lens and manual parameter settings including manual exposure and focus years before these were widely adapted among smartphones The S4 Zoom additionally has a rotary knob ring around the lens and a tripod mount While screen sizes have increased manufacturers have attempted to make smartphones thinner at the expense of utility and sturdiness since a thinner frame is more vulnerable to bending and has less space for components namely battery capacity Operating system competition The iPhone and later touchscreenonly Android devices together popularized the slate form factor based on a large capacitive touchscreen as the sole means of interaction and led to the decline of earlier keyboard and keypadfocused platforms Later navigation keys such as the home back menu task and search buttons have also been increasingly replaced by nonphysical touch keys then virtual simulated onscreen navigation keys commonly with access combinations such as a long press of the task key to simulate a short menu key press as with home button to search More recent bezelless types have their screen surface space extended to the units front bottom to compensate for the display area lost for simulating the navigation keys While virtual keys offer more potential customizability their location may be inconsistent among systems depending on screen rotation and software used Multiple vendors attempted to update or replace their existing smartphone platforms and devices to bettercompete with Android and the iPhone Palm unveiled a new platform known as webOS for its Palm Pre in late2009 to replace Palm OS which featured a focus on a taskbased card metaphor and seamless synchronization and integration between various online services as opposed to the thenconventional concept of a smartphone needing a PC to serve as a canonical authoritative repository for user data HP acquired Palm in 2010 and released several other webOS devices including the Pre 3 and HP TouchPad tablet As part of a proposed divestment of its consumer business to focus on enterprise software HP abruptly ended development of future webOS devices in August 2011 and sold the rights to webOS to LG Electronics in 2013 for use as a smart TV platform Research in Motion introduced the verticalsliding BlackBerry Torch and BlackBerry OS 6 in 2010 which featured a redesigned user interface support for gestures such as pinchtozoom and a new web browser based on the same WebKit rendering engine used by the iPhone The following year RIM released BlackBerry OS 7 and new models in the Bold and Torch ranges which included a new Bold with a touchscreen alongside its keyboard and the Torch 9860the first BlackBerry phone to not include a physical keyboard In 2013 it replaced the legacy BlackBerry OS with a revamped QNXbased platform known as BlackBerry 10 with the alltouch BlackBerry Z10 and keyboardequipped Q10 as launch devices In 2010 Microsoft unveiled a replacement for Windows Mobile known as Windows Phone featuring a new touchscreencentric user interface built around flat design and typography a home screen with live tiles containing feeds of updates from apps as well as integrated Microsoft Office apps In February 2011 Nokia announced that it had entered into a major partnership with Microsoft under which it would exclusively use Windows Phone on all of its future smartphones and integrate Microsofts Bing search engine and Bing Maps which as part of the partnership would also license Nokia Maps data into all future devices The announcement led to the abandonment of both Symbian as well as MeeGoa Linuxbased mobile platform it was codeveloping with Intel Nokias lowend Lumia 520 saw strong demand and helped Windows Phone gain niche popularity in some markets overtaking BlackBerry in global market share in 2013 In midJune 2012 Meizu released its mobile operating system Flyme OS Many of these attempts to compete with Android and iPhone were shortlived Over the course of the decade the two platforms became a clear duopoly in smartphone sales and market share with BlackBerry Windows Phone and other operating systems eventually stagnating to little or no measurable market share In 2015 BlackBerry began to pivot away from its inhouse mobile platforms in favor of producing Android devices focusing on a securityenhanced distribution of the software The following year the company announced that it would also exit the hardware market to focus more on software and its enterprise middleware and began to license the BlackBerry brand and its Android distribution to thirdparty OEMs such as TCL for future devices In September 2013 Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Nokias mobile device business for 71 billion as part of a strategy under CEO Steve Ballmer for Microsoft to be a devices and services company Despite the growth of Windows Phone and the Lumia range which accounted for nearly 90 of all Windows Phone devices sold the platform never had significant market share in the key US market and Microsoft was unable to maintain Windows Phones momentum in the years that followed resulting in dwindling interest from users and app developers After Balmer was succeeded by Satya Nadella who has placed a larger focus on software and cloud computing as CEO of Microsoft it took a 76 billion writeoff on the Nokia assets in July 2015 and laid off nearly the entire Microsoft Mobile unit in May 2016 Prior to the completion of the sale to Microsoft Nokia released a series of Androidderived smartphones for emerging markets known as Nokia X which combined an Androidbased platform with elements of Windows Phone and Nokias feature phone platform Asha using Microsoft and Nokia services rather than Google Camera advancements The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP210 released in Japan in May 1999 It was called a mobile videophone at the time and had a 110000pixel frontfacing camera It could send up to two images per second over Japans Personal Handyphone System PHS cellular network and store up to 20 JPEG digital images which could be sent over email The first massmarket camera phone was the JSH04 a Sharp JPhone model sold in Japan in November 2000 It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication By the mid2000s higherend cell phones commonly had integrated digital cameras In 2003 camera phones outsold standalone digital cameras and in 2006 they outsold film and digital standalone cameras Five billion camera phones were sold in five years and by 2007 more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008 Many early smartphones did not have cameras at all and earlier models that had them had low performance and insufficient image and video quality that could not compete with budget pocket cameras and fulfill users needs By the beginning of the 2010s almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera The decline in sales of standalone cameras accelerated due to the increasing use of smartphones with rapidly improving camera technology for casual photography easier image manipulation and abilities to directly share photos through the use of apps and webbased services By 2011 cell phones with integrated cameras were selling hundreds of millions per year In 2015 digital camera sales were 35395 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sales numbers at their peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number at their peak Contributing to the rise in popularity of smartphones being used over dedicated cameras for photography smaller pocket cameras have difficulty producing bokeh in images but nowadays some smartphones have duallens cameras that reproduce the bokeh effect easily and can even rearrange the level of bokeh after shooting This works by capturing multiple images with different focus settings then combining the background of the main image with a macro focus shot In 2007 the Nokia N95 was notable as a smartphone that had a 50 Megapixel MP camera when most others had cameras with around 3 MP or less than 2 MP Some specialized feature phones like the LG Viewty Samsung SGHG800 and Sony Ericsson K850i all released later that year also had 50 MP cameras By 2010 50 MP cameras were common a few smartphones had 80 MP cameras and the Nokia N8 Sony Ericsson Satio and Samsung M8910 Pixon12 feature phone had 12 MP The main camera of the 2009 Nokia N86 uniquely features a threelevel aperture lens The Altek Leo a 14megapixel smartphone with 3x optical zoom lens and 720p HD video camera was released in late 2010 In 2011 the same year the Nintendo 3DS was released HTC unveiled the Evo 3D a 3D phone with a dual fivemegapixel rear camera setup for spatial imaging among the earliest mobile phones with more than one rear camera The 2012 Samsung Galaxy S3 introduced the ability to capture photos using voice commands In 2012 Nokia announced and released the Nokia 808 PureView featuring a 41megapixel 112inch sensor and a highresolution f24 Zeiss allaspherical onegroup lens The high resolution enables four times of lossless digital zoom at 1080p and six times at 720p resolution using image sensor cropping The 2013 Nokia Lumia 1020 has a similar highresolution camera setup with the addition of optical image stabilization and manual camera settings years before common among highend mobile phones although lacking expandable storage that could be of use for accordingly high file sizes Mobile optical image stabilization was first introduced by Nokia in 2012 with the Lumia 920 and the earliest known smartphone with an optically stabilized front camera is the HTC 10 from 2016 Optical image stabilization enables prolonged exposure times for lowlight photography and smoothing out handheld video shaking since the appearance of shakes magnifies over a larger display such as a monitor or television set which would be detrimental to the watching experience Since 2012 smartphones have become increasingly able to capture photos while filming The resolution of those photos resolution may vary between devices Samsung has used the highest image sensor resolution at the videos aspect ratio which at 169 is 6 Megapixels 3264 1836 on the Galaxy S3 and 96 Megapixels 4128 2322 on the Galaxy S4 The earliest iPhones with such functionality iPhone 5 and 5s captured simultaneous photos at 09 Megapixels 1280 720 while filming Starting in 2013 on the Xperia Z1 Sony experimented with realtime augmented reality camera effects such as floating text virtual plants volcano and a dinosaur walking in the scenery Apple later did similarly in 2017 with the iPhone X In the same year iOS 7 introduced the later widely implemented viewfinder intuition where exposure value can be adjusted through vertical swiping after focus and exposure has been set by tapping and even while locked after holding down for a brief moment On some devices this intuition may be restricted by software in videoslow motion modes and for front camera In 2013 Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S4 Zoom smartphone with the grip shape of a compact camera and a 10 optical zoom lens as well as a rotary knob ring around the lens as used on higherend compact cameras and an ISO 1222 tripod mount It is equipped with manual parameter settings including for focus and exposure The successor 2014 Samsung Galaxy K Zoom brought resolution and performance enhancements but lacks the rotary knob and tripod mount to allow for a more smartphonelike shape with less protruding lens The 2014 Panasonic Lumix DMCCM1 was another attempt at mixing mobile phone with compact camera so much so that it inherited the Lumix brand While lacking optical zoom its image sensor has a format of 1 as used in highend compact cameras such as the Lumix DMCLX100 and Sony CyberShot DSCRX100 series with multiple times the surface size of a typical mobile camera image sensor as well as support for light sensitivities of up to ISO 25600 well beyond the typical mobile camera light sensitivity range As of 2021 no successor has been released In 2013 and 2014 HTC experimentally traded in pixel count for pixel surface size on their One M7 and M8 both with only four megapixels marketed as UltraPixel citing improved brightness and less noise in low light though the more recent One M8 lacks optical image stabilization The One M8 additionally was one of the earliest smartphones to be equipped with a dual camera setup Its software allows generating visual spatial effects such as 3D panning weather effects and focus adjustment UFocus simulating the postphotographic selective focusing capability of images produced by a lightfield camera HTC returned to a highmegapixel singlecamera setup on the 2015 One M9 Meanwhile in 2014 LG Mobile started experimenting with timeofflight camera functionality where a rear laser beam that measures distance accelerates autofocus Phasedetection autofocus was increasingly adapted throughout the mid2010s allowing for quicker and more accurate focusing than contrast detection In 2016 Apple introduced the iPhone 7 Plus one of the phones to popularize a dual camera setup The iPhone 7 Plus included a main 12 MP camera along with a 12 MP telephoto camera In early 2018 Huawei released a new flagship phone the Huawei P20 Pro one of the first triple camera lens setups with Leica optics In late 2018 Samsung released a new midrange smartphone the Galaxy A9 2018 with the worlds first quad camera setup The Nokia 9 PureView was released in 2019 featuring a pentalens camera system 2019 saw the commercialization of high resolution sensors which use pixel binning to capture more light 48 MP and 64 MP sensors developed by Sony and Samsung are commonly used by several manufacturers 108 MP sensors were first implemented in late 2019 and early 2020 Video resolution With stronger getting chipsets to handle computing workload demands at higher pixel rates mobile video resolution and framerate has caught up with dedicated consumergrade cameras over years In 2009 the Samsung Omnia HD became the first mobile phone with 720p HD video recording In the same year Apple brought video recording initially to the iPhone 3GS at 480p whereas the 2007 original iPhone and 2008 iPhone 3G lacked video recording entirely 720p was more widely adapted in 2010 on smartphones such as the original Samsung Galaxy S Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 iPhone 4 and HTC Desire HD The early 2010s brought a steep increase in mobile video resolution 1080p mobile video recording was achieved in 2011 on the Samsung Galaxy S2 HTC Sensation and iPhone 4s In 2012 and 2013 select devices with 720p filming at 60 frames per second were released the Asus PadFone 2 and HTC One M7 unlike flagships of Samsung Sony and Apple However the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom does support it In 2013 the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 introduced 2160p 4K video recording at 30 frames per second as well as 1080p doubled to 60 frames per second for smoothness Other vendors adapted 2160p recording in 2014 including the optically stabilized LG G3 Apple first implemented it in late 2015 on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus The framerate at 2160p was widely doubled to 60 in 2017 and 2018 starting with the iPhone 8 Galaxy S9 LG G7 and OnePlus 6 Sufficient computing performance of chipsets and image sensor resolution and its reading speeds have enabled mobile 4320p 8K filming in 2020 introduced with the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Redmi K30 Pro though some upper resolution levels were foregone skipped throughout development including 1440p 25K 2880p 5K and 3240p 6K except 1440p on Samsung Galaxy front cameras Midclass Among midrange smartphone series the introduction of higher video resolutions was initially delayed by two to three years compared to flagship counterparts 720p was widely adapted in 2012 including with the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini Sony Xperia go and 1080p in 2013 on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and HTC One mini The proliferation of video resolutions beyond 1080p has been postponed by several years The midclass Sony Xperia M5 supported 2160p filming in 2016 whereas Samsungs midclass series such as the Galaxy J and A series were strictly limited to 1080p in resolution and 30 frames per second at any resolution for six years until around 2019 whether and how much for technical reasons is unclear Setting A lower video resolution setting may be desirable to extend recording time by reducing space storage and power consumption The camera software of some smartphones is equipped with separate controls for resolution frame rate and bit rate An example of a smartphone with these controls is the LG V10 Slow motion video A distinction between different camera software is the method used to store high frame rate video footage with more recent phones retaining both the image sensors original output frame rate and audio while earlier phones do not record audio and stretch the video so it can be played back slowly at default speed While the stretched encoding method used on earlier phones enables slow motion playback on video player software that lacks manual playback speed control typically found on older devices if the aim were to achieve a slow motion effect the realtime method used by more recent phones offers greater versatility for video editing where slowed down portions of the footage can be freely selected by the user and exported into a separate video A rudimentary video editing software for this purpose is usually preinstalled The video can optionally be played back at normal realtime speed acting as usual video Development The earliest smartphone known to feature a slow motion mode is the 2009 Samsung i8000 Omnia II which can record at QVGA 320240 at 120 fps frames per second Slow motion is not available on the Galaxy S1 Galaxy S2 Galaxy Note 1 and Galaxy S3 flagships In early 2012 the HTC One X allowed 768432 pixel slow motion filming at an undocumented frame rate The output footage has been measured as a third of realtime speed In late 2012 the Galaxy Note 2 brought back slow motion with D1 720 480 at 120 fps In early 2013 the Galaxy S4 and HTC One M7 recorded at that frame rate with 800 450 followed by the Note 3 and iPhone 5s with 720p 1280 720 in late 2013 the latter of which retaines audio and original sensor frame rate as with all later iPhones In early 2014 the Sony Xperia Z2 and HTC One M8 adapted this resolution as well In late 2014 the iPhone 6 doubled the frame rate to 240 fps and in late 2015 the iPhone 6s added support for 1080p 1920 1080 at 120 frames per second In early 2015 the Galaxy S6 became the first Samsung mobile phone to retain the sensor framerate and audio and in early 2016 the Galaxy S7 became the first Samsung mobile phone with 240 fps recording also at 720p In early 2015 the MT6795 chipset by MediaTek promised 1080p480 fps video recording The projects status remains indefinite Since early 2017 starting with the Sony Xperia XZ smartphones have been released with a slow motion mode that unsustainably records at framerates multiple times as high by temporarily storing frames on the image sensors internal burst memory Such a recording lasts a few realtime seconds at most In late 2017 the iPhone 8 brought 1080p at 240 fps as well as 2160p at 60 fps followed by the Galaxy S9 in early 2018 In mid2018 the OnePlus 6 brought 720p at 480 fps sustainable for one minute In early 2021 the OnePlus 9 Pro became the first phone with 2160p at 120 fps HDR video The first smartphones to record HDR video were the early 2013 Sony Xperia Z and mid2013 Xperia Z Ultra followed by the early 2014 Galaxy S5 all at 1080p Audio recording Mobile phones with multiple microphones usually allow video recording with stereo audio for spaciality with Samsung Sony and HTC initially implementing it in 2012 on their Samsung Galaxy S3 Sony Xperia S and HTC One X Apple implemented stereo audio starting with the 2018 iPhone Xs family and iPhone XR Front cameras Photo Emphasis is being put on the front camera since the mid2010s where front cameras have reached resolutions as high as typical rear cameras such as the 2015 LG G4 8 megapixels Sony Xperia C5 Ultra 13 megapixels and 2016 Sony Xperia XA Ultra 16 megapixels optically stabilized The 2015 LG V10 brought a dual front camera system where the second has a wider angle for group photography Samsung implemented a frontcamera sweep panorama panorama selfie feature since the Galaxy Note 4 to extend the field of view Video In 2012 the Galaxy S3 and iPhone 5 brought 720p HD front video recording at 30 fps In early 2013 the Samsung Galaxy S4 HTC One M7 and Sony Xperia Z brought 1080p Full HD at that framerate and in late 2014 the Galaxy Note 4 introduced 1440p video recording on the front camera Apple adapted 1080p front camera video with the late 2016 iPhone 7 In 2019 smartphones started adapting 2160p 4K video recording on the front camera six years after rear camera 2160p commenced with the Galaxy Note 3 Display advancements In the early 2010s larger smartphones with screen sizes of at least 140 millimetres 55 in diagonal dubbed phablets began to achieve popularity with the 2011 Samsung Galaxy Note series gaining notably wide adoption In 2013 Huawei launched the Huawei Mate series sporting a 155 millimetres 61 in HD 1280 x 720 IPS LCD display which was considered to be quite large at the time Some companies began to release smartphones in 2013 incorporating flexible displays to create curved form factors such as the Samsung Galaxy Round and LG G Flex By 2014 1440p displays began to appear on highend smartphones In 2015 Sony released the Xperia Z5 Premium featuring a 4K resolution display although only images and videos could actually be rendered at that resolution all other software was shown at 1080p New trends for smartphone displays began to emerge in 2017 with both LG and Samsung releasing flagship smartphones LG G6 and Galaxy S8 utilizing displays with taller aspect ratios than the common 169 ratio and a high screentobody ratio also known as a bezelless design These designs allow the display to have a larger diagonal measurement but with a slimmer width than 169 displays with an equivalent screen size Another trend popularized in 2017 were displays containing tablike cutouts at the topcentrecolloquially known as a notchto contain the frontfacing camera and sometimes other sensors typically located along the top bezel of a device These designs allow for edgetoedge displays that take up nearly the entire height of the device with little to no bezel along the top and sometimes a minimal bottom bezel as well This design characteristic appeared almost simultaneously on the Sharp Aquos S2 and the Essential Phone which featured small circular tabs for their cameras followed just a month later by the iPhone X which used a wider tab to contain a camera and facial scanning system known as Face ID The 2016 LG V10 had a precursor to the concept with a portion of the screen wrapped around the camera area in the topleft corner and the resulting area marketed as a second display that could be used for various supplemental features Other variations of the practice later emerged such as a holepunch camera such as those of the Honor View 20 and Samsungs Galaxy A8s and Galaxy S10eschewing the tabbed notch for a circular or roundedrectangular cutout within the screen instead while Oppo released the first allscreen phones with no notches at all including one with a mechanical front camera that pops up from the top of the device Find X and a 2019 prototype for a frontfacing camera that can be embedded and hidden below the display using a special partiallytranslucent screen structure that allows light to reach the image sensor below the panel The first implementation was the ZTE Axon 20 5G with a 32 MP sensor manufactured by Visionox Displays supporting refresh rates higher than 60 Hz such as 90 Hz or 120 Hz also began to appear on smartphones in 2017 initially confined to gaming smartphones such as the Razer Phone 2017 and Asus ROG Phone 2018 they later became more common on flagship phones such as the Pixel 4 2019 and Samsung Galaxy S21 series 2021 Higher refresh rates allow for smoother motion and lower input latency but often at the cost of battery life As such the device may offer a means to disable high refresh rates or be configured to automatically reduce the refresh rate when there is low onscreen motion Multitasking An early implementation of multiple simultaneous tasks on a smartphone display are the pictureinpicture video playback mode popup play and live video list with playing video thumbnails of the 2012 Samsung Galaxy S3 the former of which was later delivered to the 2011 Samsung Galaxy Note through a software update Later that year a splitscreen mode was implemented on the Galaxy Note 2 later retrofitted on the Galaxy S3 through the premium suite upgrade The earliest implementation of desktop and laptoplike windowing was on the 2013 Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Foldable smartphones Smartphones utilizing flexible displays were theorized as possible once manufacturing costs and production processes were feasible In November 2018 the startup company Royole unveiled the first commercially available foldable smartphone the Royole FlexPai Also that month Samsung presented a prototype phone featuring an Infinity Flex Display at its developers conference with a smaller outer display on its cover and a larger tabletsized display when opened Samsung stated that it also had to develop a new polymer material to coat the display as opposed to glass Samsung officially announced the Galaxy Fold based on the previously demonstrated prototype in February 2019 for an originallyscheduled release in lateApril Due to various durability issues with the display and hinge systems encountered by early reviewers the release of the Galaxy Fold was delayed to September to allow for design changes In November 2019 Motorola unveiled a variation of the concept with its reimagining of the Razr using a horizontallyfolding display to create a clamshell form factor inspired by its previous feature phone range of the same name Samsung would unveil a similar device known as the Galaxy Z Flip the following February Other developments in the 2010s The first smartphone with a fingerprint reader was the Motorola Atrix 4G in 2011 In September 2013 the iPhone 5S was unveiled as the first smartphone on a major US carrier since the Atrix to feature this technology Once again the iPhone popularized this concept One of the barriers of fingerprint reading amongst consumers was security concerns however Apple was able to address these concerns by encrypting this fingerprint data onto the A7 Processor located inside the phone as well as make sure this information could not be accessed by thirdparty applications and is not stored in iCloud or Apple servers In 2012 Samsung introduced the Galaxy S3 GTi9300 with retrofittable wireless charging popup video playback 4GLTE variant GTi9305 quadcore processor In 2013 Fairphone launched its first socially ethical smartphone at the London Design Festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing followed by Shiftphone in 2015 In late 2013 QSAlpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security encryption and identity protection In October 2013 Motorola Mobility announced Project Ara a concept for a modular smartphone platform that would allow users to customize and upgrade their phones with addon modules that attached magnetically to a frame Ara was retained by Google following its sale of Motorola Mobility to Lenovo but was shelved in 2016 That year LG and Motorola both unveiled smartphones featuring a limited form of modularity for accessories the LG G5 allowed accessories to be installed via the removal of its battery compartment while the Moto Z utilizes accessories attached magnetically to the rear of the device Microsoft expanding upon the concept of Motorolas shortlived Webtop unveiled functionality for its Windows 10 operating system for phones that allows supported devices to be docked for use with a PCstyled desktop environment Samsung and LG used to be the last standing manufacturers to offer flagship devices with userreplaceable batteries But in 2015 Samsung succumbed to the minimalism trend set by Apple introducing the Galaxy S6 without a userreplaceable battery In addition Samsung was criticised for pruning longstanding features such as MHL MicroUSB 30 water resistance and MicroSD card support of which the latter two came back in 2016 with the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge As of 2015 the global median for smartphone ownership was 43 Statista forecast that 287 billion people would own smartphones in 2020 Within the same decade rapid deployment of LTE cellular network and general availability of smartphones have increased popularity of the streaming television services and the corresponding mobile TV apps Major technologies that began to trend in 2016 included a focus on virtual reality and augmented reality experiences catered towards smartphones the newly introduced USBC connector and improving LTE technologies In 2016 adjustable screen resolution known from desktop operating systems was introduced to smartphones for power saving whereas variable screen refresh rates were popularized in 2020 In 2018 the first smartphones featuring fingerprint readers embedded within OLED displays were announced followed in 2019 by an implementation using an ultrasonic sensor on the Samsung Galaxy S10 In 2019 the majority of smartphones released have more than one camera are waterproof with IP67 and IP68 ratings and unlock using facial recognition or fingerprint scanners Designs first implemented by Apple have been replicated by other vendors several times These include a sealed body that does not allow replacing the battery a lack of the physical audio connector since the iPhone 7 from 2016 a screen with a cutout area at the top for the earphone and frontfacing camera and sensors colloquially known as notch since the iPhone X from 2017 the exclusion of a charging wall adapter from the scope of delivery since the iPhone 12 from 2019 and a camera user interface with circular and usually solidcolour shutter button and a camera mode selector using perpendicular text and separate camera modes for photo and video since iOS 7 from 2013 Other developments in the 2020s In 2020 the first smartphones featuring highspeed 5G network capability were announced Since 2020 smartphones have decreasingly been shipped with rudimentary accessories like a power adapter and headphones that have historically been almost invariably within the scope of delivery This trend was initiated with Apples iPhone 12 followed by Samsung and Xiaomi on the Galaxy S21 and Mi 11 respectively months after having mocked the same through advertisements The reason cited is reducing environmental footprint though reaching raised charging rates supported by newer models demands a new charger shipped through separate packaging with its own environmental footprint With the development of the PinePhone and Librem 5 in the 2020s there are intensified efforts to make open source GNULinux for smartphones a major alternative to iOS and Android Moreover associated software enabled convergence beyond convergent and hybrid apps by allowing the smartphones to be used like a desktop computer when connected to a keyboard mouse and monitor In the early 2020s manufacturers began to integrate satellite connectivity into smartphone devices for use in remote areas where local terrestrial communication infrastructures such as landline and cellular networks are not available Due to the antenna limitations in the conventional phones in the early stages of implementation satellite connectivity would be limited to the satellite messaging and satellite emergency services Hardware A typical smartphone contains a number of metaloxidesemiconductor MOS integrated circuit IC chips which in turn contain billions of tiny MOS fieldeffect transistors MOSFETs A typical smartphone contains the following MOS IC chips Application processor CMOS systemonachip Flash memory floatinggate MOS memory Cellular modem baseband RF CMOS RF transceiver RF CMOS Phone camera image sensor CMOS image sensor Power management integrated circuit power MOSFETs Display driver LCD or LED driver Wireless communication chips WiFi Bluetooth GPS receiver Sound chip audio codec and power amplifier Gyroscope Capacitive touchscreen controller ASIC and DSP RF power amplifier LDMOS Some are also equipped with an FM radio receiver a hardware notification LED and an infrared transmitter for use as remote control A few models have additional sensors such as thermometer for measuring ambient temperature hygrometer for humidity and a sensor for ultraviolet ray measurement A few smartphones designed around specific purposes are equipped with uncommon hardware such as a projector Samsung Beam i8520 and Samsung Galaxy Beam i8530 optical zoom lenses Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom and Samsung Galaxy K Zoom thermal camera and even PMR446 walkietalkie radio transceiver Central processing unit Smartphones have central processing units CPUs similar to those in computers but optimised to operate in low power environments In smartphones the CPU is typically integrated in a CMOS complementary metaloxidesemiconductor systemonachip SoC application processor The performance of mobile CPU depends not only on the clock rate generally given in multiples of hertz but also on the memory hierarchy Because of these challenges the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications Buttons Smartphones are typically equipped with a power button and volume buttons Some pairs of volume buttons are unified Some are equipped with a dedicated camera shutter button Units for outdoor use may be equipped with an SOS emergency call and PTT pushtotalk button The presence of physical frontside buttons such as the home and navigation buttons has decreased throughout the 2010s increasingly becoming replaced by capacitive touch sensors and simulated onscreen buttons As with classic mobile phones early smartphones such as the Samsung Omnia II were equipped with buttons for accepting and declining phone calls Due to the advancements of functionality besides phone calls these have increasingly been replaced by navigation buttons such as menu also known as options back and tasks Some early 2010s smartphones such as the HTC Desire were additionally equipped with a Search button for quick access to a web search engine or apps internal search feature Since 2013 smartphones home buttons started integrating fingerprint scanners starting with the iPhone 5s and Samsung Galaxy S5 Functions may be assigned to button combinations For example screenshots can usually be taken using the home and power buttons with a short press on iOS and onesecond holding Android OS the two most popular mobile operating systems On smartphones with no physical home button usually the volumedown button is instead pressed with the power button Some smartphones have a screenshot and possibly screencast shortcuts in the navigation button bar or the power button menu Display One of the main characteristics of smartphones is the screen Depending on the devices design the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a devices front surface Many smartphone displays have an aspect ratio of 169 but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017 as well as the aim to eliminate bezels by extending the display surface to as close to the edges as possible Screen sizes Screen sizes are measured in diagonal inches Phones with screens larger than 52 inches are often called phablets Smartphones with screens over 45 inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface they may need to be shifted around in the hand held in one hand and manipulated by the other or used in place with both hands Due to design advances some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and edgetoedge designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 169 displays Panel types Liquidcrystal displays LCDs and organic lightemitting diode OLED displays are the most common Some displays are integrated with pressuresensitive digitizers such as those developed by Wacom and Samsung and Apples Force Touch system A few phones such as the YotaPhone prototype are equipped with a lowpower electronic paper rear display as used in ebook readers Alternative input methods Some devices are equipped with additional input methods such as a stylus for higher precision input and hovering detection or a selfcapacitive touch screens layer for floating finger detection The latter has been implemented on few phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S4 Note 3 S5 Alpha and Sony Xperia Sola making the Galaxy Note 3 the only smartphone with both so far Hovering can enable preview tooltips such as on the video players seek bar in text messages and quick contacts on the dial pad as well as lock screen animations and the simulation of a hovering mouse cursor on web sites Some styluses support hovering as well and are equipped with a button for quick access to relevant tools such as digital postit notes and highlighting of text and elements when dragging while pressed resembling drag selection using a computer mouse Some series such as the Samsung Galaxy Note series and LG G Stylus series have an integrated tray to store the stylus in Few devices such as the iPhone 6s until iPhone Xs and Huawei Mate S are equipped with a pressuresensitive touch screen where the pressure may be used to simulate a gas pedal in video games access to preview windows and shortcut menus controlling the typing cursor and a weight scale the latest of which has been rejected by Apple from the App Store Some early 2010s HTC smartphones such as the HTC Desire Bravo and HTC Legend are equipped with an optical track pad for scrolling and selection Notification light Many smartphones except Apple iPhones are equipped with lowpower lightemitting diodes besides the screen that are able to notify the user about incoming messages missed calls low battery levels and facilitate locating the mobile phone in darkness with marginial power consumption To distinguish between the sources of notifications the colour combination and blinking pattern can vary Usually three diodes in red green and blue RGB are able to create a multitude of colour combinations Sensors Smartphones are equipped with a multitude of sensors to enable system features and thirdparty applications Common sensors Accelerometers and gyroscopes enable automatic control of screen rotation Uses by thirdparty software include bubble level simulation An ambient light sensor allows for automatic screen brightness and contrast adjustment and an RGB sensor enables the adaption of screen colour Many mobile phones are also equipped with a barometer sensor to measure air pressure such as Samsung since 2012 with the Galaxy S3 and Apple since 2014 with the iPhone 6 It allows estimating and detecting changes in altitude A magnetometer can act as a digital compass by measuring Earths magnetic field Rare sensors Samsung equips their flagship smartphones since the 2014 Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 with a heart rate sensor to assist in fitnessrelated uses and act as a shutter key for the frontfacing camera So far only the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 and Note 3 are equipped with an ambient temperature sensor and a humidity sensor and only the Note 4 with an ultraviolet radiation sensor which could warn the user about excessive exposure A rear infrared laser beam for distance measurement can enable timeofflight camera functionality with accelerated autofocus as implemented on select LG mobile phones starting with LG G3 and LG V10 Due to their currently rare occurrence among smartphones not much software to utilize these sensors has been developed yet Storage While eMMC embedded multi media card flash storage was most commonly used in mobile phones its successor UFS Universal Flash Storage with higher transfer rates emerged throughout the 2010s for upperclass devices Capacity While the internal storage capacity of mobile phones has been nearstagnant during the first half of the 2010s it has increased steeper during its second half with Samsung for example increasing the available internal storage options of their flagship class units from 32 GB to 512 GB within only 212 years between 2016 and 2018 Memory cards The space for data storage of some mobile phones can be expanded using MicroSD memory cards whose capacity has multiplied throughout the 2010s SD card 20092019 SDXC Benefits over USB on the go storage and cloud storage include offline availability and privacy not reserving and protruding from the charging port no connection instability or latency no dependence on voluminous data plans and preservation of the limited rewriting cycles of the devices permanent internal storage Large amounts of data can be moved immediately between devices by changing memory cards largescale data backups can be created offline and data can be read externally should the smartphone be inoperable In case of technical defects which make the device unusable or unbootable as a result of liquid damage fall damage screen damage bending damage malware or bogus system updates etc data stored on the memory card is likely rescueable externally while data on the inaccessible internal storage would be lost A memory card can usually immediately be reused in a different memorycardenabled device with no necessity for prior file transfers Some dualSIM mobile phones are equipped with a hybrid slot where one of the two slots can be occupied by either a SIM card or a memory card Some models typically of higher end are equipped with three slots including one dedicated memory card slot for simultaneous dualSIM and memory card usage Physical location The location of both SIM and memory card slots vary among devices where they might be located accessibly behind the back cover or else behind the battery the latter of which denies hot swapping Mobile phones with nonremovable rear cover typically house SIM and memory cards in a small tray on the handsets frame ejected by inserting a needle tool into a pinhole Some earlier midrange phones such as the 2011 Samsung Galaxy Fit and Ace have a sideways memory card slot on the frame covered by a cap that can be opened without tool File transfer Originally mass storage access was commonly enabled to computers through USB Over time mass storage access was removed leaving the Media Transfer Protocol as protocol for USB file transfer due to its nonexclusive access ability where the computer is able to access the storage without it being locked away from the mobile phones software for the duration of the connection and no necessity for common file system support as communication is done through an abstraction layer However unlike mass storage Media Transfer Protocol lacks parallelism meaning that only a single transfer can run at a time for which other transfer requests need to wait to finish This for example denies browsing photos and playing back videos from the device during an active file transfer Some programs and devices lack support for MTP In addition the direct access and random access of files through MTP is not supported Any file is wholly downloaded from the device before opened Sound Some audio quality enhancing features such as Voice over LTE and HD Voice have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in longdistance calls Audio quality can be improved using a VoIP application over WiFi Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a speakerphone feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component without holding the phone close to the ear However integrated speakers may be small and of restricted sound quality to conserve space Some mobile phones such as the HTC One M8 and the Sony Xperia Z2 are equipped with stereophonic speakers to create spacial sound when in horizontal orientation Audio connector The 35mm headphone receptible coll headphone jack allows the immediate operation of passive headphones as well as connection to other external auxiliary audio appliances Among devices equipped with the connector it is more commonly located at the bottom charging port side than on the top of the device The decline of the connectors availability among newly released mobile phones among all major vendors commenced in 2016 with its lack on the Apple iPhone 7 An adapter reserving the charging port can retrofit the plug Batterypowered wireless Bluetooth headphones are an alternative Those tend to be costlier however due to their need for internal hardware such as a Bluetooth transceiver and a battery with a charging controller and a Bluetooth coupling is required ahead of each operation Battery Smartphones typically feature lithiumion or lithiumpolymer batteries due to their high energy densities Batteries chemically wear down as a result of repeated charging and discharging throughout ordinary usage losing both energy capacity and output power which results in loss of processing speeds followed by system outages Battery capacity may be reduced to 80 after few hundred recharges and the drop in performance accelerates with time Some mobile phones are designed with batteries that can be interchanged upon expiration by the end user usually by opening the back cover While such a design had initially been used in most mobile phones including those with touch screen that were not Apple iPhones it has largely been usurped throughout the 2010s by permanently builtin nonreplaceable batteries a design practice criticized for planned obsolescence Charging Due to limitations of electrical currents that existing USB cables copper wires could handle charging protocols which make use of elevated voltages such as Qualcomm Quick Charge and MediaTek Pump Express have been developed to increase the power throughput for faster charging to maximize the usage time without restricted ergonomy and to minimize the time a device needs to be attached to a power source The smartphones integrated charge controller IC requests the elevated voltage from a supported charger VOOC by Oppo also marketed as dash charge took the counter approach and increased current to cut out some heat produced from internally regulating the arriving voltage in the end device down to the batterys charging terminal voltage but is incompatible with existing USB cables as it requires the thicker copper wires of highcurrent USB cables Later USB Power Delivery USBPD was developed with the aim to standardize the negotiation of charging parameters across devices of up to 100 Watts but is only supported on cables with USBC on both endings due to the connectors dedicated PD channels While charging rates have been increasing with 15 watts in 2014 20 Watts in 2016 and 45 watts in 2018 the power throughput may be throttled down significantly during operation of the device Wireless charging has been widely adapted allowing for intermittent recharging without wearing down the charging port through frequent reconnection with Qi being the most common standard followed by Powermat Due to the lower efficiency of wireless power transmission charging rates are below that of wired charging and more heat is produced at similar charging rates By the end of 2017 smartphone battery life has become generally adequate however earlier smartphone battery life was poor due to the weak batteries that could not handle the significant power requirements of the smartphones computer systems and color screens Smartphone users purchase additional chargers for use outside the home at work and in cars and by buying portable external battery packs External battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custommade models that piggyback onto a smartphones case In 2016 Samsung had to recall millions of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to an explosive battery issue For consumer convenience wireless charging stations have been introduced in some hotels bars and other public spaces Power management A technique to minimize power consumption is the panel selfrefresh whereby the image to be shown on the display is not sent at all times from the processor to the integrated controller IC of the display component but only if the information on screen is changed The displays integrated controller instead memorizes the last screen contents and refreshes the screen by itself This technology was introduced around 2014 and has reduced power consumption by a few hundred milliwatts Cameras Cameras have become standard features of smartphones As of 2019 phone cameras are now a highly competitive area of differentiation between models with advertising campaigns commonly based on a focus on the quality or capabilities of a devices main cameras Images are usually saved in the JPEG file format some highend phones since the mid2010s also have RAW imaging capability Space constraints Typically smartphones have at least one main rearfacing camera and a lowerresolution frontfacing camera for selfies and video chat Owing to the limited depth available in smartphones for image sensors and optics rearfacing cameras are often housed in a bump that is thicker than the rest of the phone Since increasingly thin mobile phones have more abundant horizontal space than the depth that is necessary and used in dedicated cameras for better lenses there is additionally a trend for phone manufacturers to include multiple cameras with each optimized for a different purpose telephoto wide angle etc Viewed from back rear cameras are commonly located at the top center or top left corner A cornered location benefits by not requiring other hardware to be packed around the camera module while increasing ergonomy as the lens is less likely to be covered when held horizontally Modern advanced smartphones have cameras with optical image stabilisation OIS larger sensors bright lenses and even optical zoom plus RAW images HDR Bokeh mode with multi lenses and multishot night modes are now also familiar Many new smartphone camera features are being enabled via computational photography image processing and multiple specialized lenses rather than larger sensors and lenses due to the constrained space available inside phones that are being made as slim as possible Dedicated camera button Some mobile phones such as the Samsung i8000 Omnia 2 some Nokia Lumias and some Sony Xperias are equipped with a physical camera shutter button Those with two pressure levels resemble the pointandshoot intuition of dedicated compact cameras The camera button may be used as a shortcut to quickly and ergonomically launch the camera software as it is located more accessibly inside a pocket than the power button Back cover materials Back covers of smartphones are typically made of polycarbonate aluminium or glass Polycarbonate back covers may be glossy or matte and possibly textured like dotted on the Galaxy S5 or leathered on the Galaxy Note 3 and Note 4 While polycarbonate back covers may be perceived as less premium among fashion and trendoriented users its utilitarian strengths and technical benefits include durability and shock absorption greater elasticity against permanent bending like metal inability to shatter like glass which facilitates designing it removable better manufacturing cost efficiency and no blockage of radio signals or wireless power like metal Accessories A wide range of accessories are sold for smartphones including cases memory cards screen protectors chargers wireless power stations USB OnTheGo adapters for connecting USB drives and or in some cases a HDMI cable to an external monitor MHL adapters addon batteries power banks headphones combined headphonemicrophones which for example allow a person to privately conduct calls on the device without holding it to the ear and Bluetoothenabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to media from their smartphones wirelessly Cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive heavyduty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell Some cases have a booklike form with a cover that the user opens to use the device when the cover is closed it protects the screen Some booklike cases have additional pockets for credit cards thus enabling people to use them as wallets Accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers However some companies like Apple stopped including chargers with smartphones in order to reduce carbon footprint etc causing many customers to pay extra for charging adapters Software Mobile operating systems A mobile operating system or mobile OS is an operating system for phones tablets smartwatches or other mobile devices Globally Android and IOS are the two most used mobile operating systems based on usage share with the former having been the best selling OS globally on all devices since 2013 Mobile operating systems combine features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use usually including and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems a touchscreen cellular Bluetooth WiFi Protected Access WiFi Global Positioning System GPS mobile navigation video and singleframe picture cameras speech recognition voice recorder music player nearfield communication and infrared blaster By Q1 2018 over 383 million smartphones were sold with 859 percent running Android 141 percent running iOS and a negligible number of smartphones running other OSes Android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system Windows and in general smartphone use even without tablets exceeds desktop use Other wellknown mobile operating systems are Flyme OS and Harmony OS Mobile devices with mobile communications abilities eg smartphones contain two mobile operating systemsthe main userfacing software platform is supplemented by a second lowlevel proprietary realtime operating system which operates the radio and other hardware Research has shown that these lowlevel systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious base stations to gain high levels of control over the mobile device Mobile app A mobile app is a computer program designed to run on a mobile device such as a smartphone The term app is a shortform of the term software application Application stores The introduction of Apples App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturerhosted online distribution for thirdparty applications software and computer programs focused on a single platform There are a huge variety of apps including video games music products and business tools Up until that point smartphone application distribution depended on thirdparty sources providing applications for multiple platforms such as GetJar Handango Handmark and PocketGear Following the success of the App Store other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores such as Googles Android Market later renamed to the Google Play Store and RIMs BlackBerry App World Androidrelated app stores like Aptoide Cafe Bazaar FDroid GetJar and Opera Mobile Store In February 2014 93 of mobile developers were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development List of current smartphone brands Sales Since 1996 smartphone shipments have had positive growth In November 2011 27 of all photographs created were taken with cameraequipped smartphones In September 2012 a study concluded that 4 out of 5 smartphone owners use the device to shop online Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013 Worldwide shipments of smartphones topped 1 billion units in 2013 up 38 from 2012s 725 million while comprising a 55 share of the mobile phone market in 2013 up from 42 in 2012 In 2013 smartphone sales began to decline for the first time In Q1 2016 for the first time the shipments dropped by 3 percent year on year The situation was caused by the maturing China market A report by NPD shows that fewer than 10 of US citizens have spent 1000 or more on smartphones as they are too expensive for most people without introducing particularly innovative features and amid Huawei Oppo and Xiaomi introducing products with similar feature sets for lower prices In 2019 smartphone sales declined by 32 the largest in smartphone history while China and India were credited with driving most smartphone sales worldwide It is predicted that widespread adoption of 5G will help drive new smartphone sales By manufacturer In 2011 Samsung had the highest shipment market share worldwide followed by Apple In 2013 Samsung had 313 market share a slight increase from 303 in 2012 while Apple was at 153 a decrease from 187 in 2012 Huawei LG and Lenovo were at about 5 each significantly better than 2012 figures while others had about 40 the same as the previous years figure Only Apple lost market share although their shipment volume still increased by 129 the rest had significant increases in shipment volumes of 36 to 92 In Q1 2014 Samsung had a 31 share and Apple had 16 In Q4 2014 Apple had a 204 share and Samsung had 199 In Q2 2016 Samsung had a 223 share and Apple had 129 In Q1 2017 IDC reported that Samsung was first placed with 80 million units followed by Apple with 508 million Huawei with 346 million Oppo with 255 million and Vivo with 227 million Samsungs mobile business is half the size of Apples by revenue Apple business increased very rapidly in the years 2013 to 2017 Realme a brand owned by Oppo is the fastestgrowing phone brand worldwide since Q2 2019 In China Huawei and Honor a brand owned by Huawei have 46 of market share combined and posted 66 annual growth as of 2019 amid growing Chinese nationalism In 2019 Samsung had a 74 market share of 5G smartphones in South Korea In the first quarter of 2024 global smartphone shipments rose by 78 to 2894 million units Samsung with a 208 market share overtook Apple to become the leading smartphone manufacturer Apples smartphone shipments dropped 10 Xiaomi secured the third spot with a 141 market share By operating system Use Contemporary use and convergence The rise in popularity of touchscreen smartphones and mobile apps distributed via app stores along with rapidly advancing network mobile processor and storage technologies led to a convergence where separate mobile phones organizers and portable media players were replaced by a smartphone as the single device most people carried Advances in digital camera sensors and ondevice image processing software more gradually led to smartphones replacing simpler cameras for photographs and video recording The builtin GPS capabilities and mapping apps on smartphones largely replaced standalone satellite navigation devices and paper maps became less common Mobile gaming on smartphones greatly grew in popularity allowing many people to use them in place of handheld game consoles and some companies tried creating game consolephone hybrids based on phone hardware and software People frequently have chosen not to get fixedline telephone service in favor of smartphones Music streaming apps and services have grown rapidly in popularity serving the same use as listening to music stations on a terrestrial or satellite radio Streaming video services are easily accessed via smartphone apps and can be used in place of watching television People have often stopped wearing wristwatches in favor of checking the time on their smartphones and many use the clock features on their phones in place of alarm clocks Mobile phones can also be used as a digital note taking text editing and memorandum device whose computerization facilitates searching of entries Additionally in many lesser technologically developed regions smartphones are peoples first and only means of Internet access due to their portability with personal computers being relatively uncommon outside of business use The cameras on smartphones can be used to photograph documents and send them via email or messaging in place of using fax facsimile machines Payment apps and services on smartphones allow people to make less use of wallets purses credit and debit cards and cash Mobile banking apps can allow people to deposit checks simply by photographing them eliminating the need to take the physical check to an ATM or teller Guide book apps can take the place of paper travel and restaurantbusiness guides museum brochures and dedicated audio guide equipment Mobile banking and payment In many countries mobile phones are used to provide mobile banking services which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure SMS text message Kenyas MPESA mobile banking service for example allows customers of the mobile phone operator Safaricom to hold cash balances which are recorded on their SIM cards Cash can be deposited or withdrawn from MPESA accounts at Safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country and can be transferred electronically from person to person and used to pay bills to companies Branchless banking has been successful in South Africa and the Philippines A pilot project in Bali was launched in 2011 by the International Finance Corporation and an Indonesian bank Bank Mandiri Another application of mobile banking technology is Zidisha a USbased nonprofit microlending platform that allows residents of developing countries to raise small business loans from Web users worldwide Zidisha uses mobile banking for loan disbursements and repayments transferring funds from lenders in the United States to borrowers in rural Africa who have mobile phones and can use the Internet Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two CocaCola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments Eventually the idea spread and in 1999 the Philippines launched the countrys first commercial mobile payments systems with mobile operators Globe and Smart Some mobile phones can make mobile payments via direct mobile billing schemes or through contactless payments if the phone and the point of sale support nearfield communication NFC Enabling contactless payments through NFCequipped mobile phones requires the cooperation of manufacturers network operators and retail merchants Facsimile Some apps allows for sending and receiving facsimile fax over a smartphone including facsimile data composed of raster bilevel graphics generated directly and digitally from document and image file formats Films Films are increasingly made using smartphones and tablets leading to the rise of dedicated film festivals for such films including the SmartFone Flick Fest in Sydney Australia Dublin Smartphone Film Festival the International Mobil Film Festival based in San Diego the Spanish festival Cinephone Festival Internacional de Cine con Smartphone the African Smartphone International Film Festival Toronto Smartphone Film Festival New York Mobile Film Festival and others Criticism and issues Social impacts Manufacture Cobalt is needed in order to manufacture smartphones rechargeable batteries Workers including children suffer injuries amputations and death as the result of the hazardous working conditions and mine tunnel collapses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during artisanal mining of cobalt In 2019 a lawsuit was filed against Apple and other tech companies for the use of child labor in mining cobalt in 2024 the court ruled that the companies were not liable Apple announced it would convert to using recycled cobalt by 2025 Use In 2012 University of Southern California study found that unprotected adolescent sexual activity was more common among owners of smartphones A study conducted by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institutes RPI Lighting Research Center LRC concluded that smartphones or any backlit devices can seriously affect sleep cycles Some persons might become psychologically attached to smartphones resulting in anxiety when separated from the devices A smombie a combination of smartphone and zombie is a walking person using a smartphone and not paying attention as they walk possibly risking an accident in the process an increasing social phenomenon The issue of slowmoving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a mobile lane for walking in Chongqing China The issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of Augsburg Germany to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement While driving Mobile phone use while drivingincluding calling text messaging playing media web browsing gaming using mapping apps or operating other phone featuresis common but controversial since it is widely considered dangerous due to what is known as distracted driving Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents In September 2010 the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by phones In March 2011 a US insurance company State Farm Insurance announced the results of a study which showed 19 of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving In Egypt Israel Japan Portugal and Singapore both handheld and handsfree calling on a mobile phone which uses a speakerphone is banned In other countries including the UK and France and in many US states calling is only banned on handheld phones while handsfree calling is permitted A 2011 study reported that over 90 of college students surveyed text initiate reply or read while driving The scientific literature on the danger of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone or texting while driving is limited A simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distractionrelated accidents when texting Due to the complexity of smartphones that began to grow more after this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and handsfree usage rather than those which ban handheld use only as officials cannot easily tell which function of the phone is being used simply by looking at the driver This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a call when in fact they were using the device legally for example when using the phones incorporated controls for car stereo GPS or satnav A 2010 study reviewed the incidence of phone use while cycling and its effects on behavior and safety In 2013 a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their phones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four A study conducted by the University of Vienna examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones such as using phones while driving Accidents involving a driver being distracted by being in a call on a phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding In the United Kingdom from 27 February 2007 motorists who are caught using a handheld phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of 60 This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law Japan prohibits all use of phones while driving including use of handsfree devices New Zealand has banned handheld phone use since 1 November 2009 Many states in the United States have banned text messaging on phones while driving Illinois became the 17th American state to enforce this law As of July 2010 30 states had banned texting while driving with Kentucky becoming the most recent addition on July 15 Public Health Law Research maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the United States This database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile devices while driving for all 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1992 when first law was passed through December 1 2010 The dataset contains information on 22 dichotomous continuous or categorical variables including for example activities regulated eg texting versus talking handsfree versus handheld calls web browsing gaming targeted populations and exemptions Legal A patent war between Samsung and Apple started when the latter claimed that the original Galaxy S Android phone copied the interfaceand possibly the hardwareof Apples iOS for the iPhone 3GS There was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving Sony Mobile Google Apple Inc Samsung Microsoft Nokia Motorola HTC Huawei and ZTE among others The conflict is part of the wider patent wars between multinational technology and software corporations To secure and increase market share companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers Since the 2010s the number of lawsuits countersuits and trade complaints based on patents and designs in the market for smartphones and devices based on smartphone OSes such as Android and iOS has increased significantly Initial suits countersuits rulings license agreements and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market stated to grow more rapidly by 2012 Medical With the rise in number of mobile medical apps in the market place government regulatory agencies raised concerns on the safety of the use of such applications These concerns were transformed into regulation initiatives worldwide with the aim of safeguarding users from untrusted medical advice According to the findings of these medical experts in recent years excessive smartphone use in society may lead to headaches sleep disorders and insufficient sleep while severe smartphone addiction may lead to physical health problems such as hunchback muscle relaxation and uneven nutrition Impacts on cognition and mental health There is a debate about beneficial and detrimental impacts of smartphones or smartphoneuses on cognition and mental health Security Smartphone malware is easily distributed through an insecure app store Often malware is hidden in pirated versions of legitimate apps which are then distributed through thirdparty app stores Malware risk also comes from what is known as an update attack where a legitimate application is later changed to include a malware component which users then install when they are notified that the app has been updated As well one out of three robberies in 2012 in the United States involved the theft of a mobile phone An online petition has urged smartphone makers to install kill switches in their devices In 2014 Apples Find my iPhone and Googles Android Device Manager can locate disable and wipe the data from phones that have been lost or stolen With BlackBerry Protect in OS version 1032 devices can be rendered unrecoverable to even BlackBerrys own Operating System recovery tools if incorrectly authenticated or dissociated from their account Leaked documents from 2013 to 2016 codenamed Vault 7 detail the capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency CIA to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones including iOS and Android In 2021 journalists and researchers reported the discovery of spyware called Pegasus developed and distributed by a private company which can and has been used to infect iOS and Android smartphones oftenpartly via use of 0day exploitswithout the need for any userinteraction or significant clues to the user and then be used to exfiltrate data track user locations capture film through its camera and activate the microphone at any time Analysis of data traffic by popular smartphones running variants of Android found substantial bydefault data collection and sharing with no optout by this preinstalled software Guidelines for mobile device security were issued by NIST and many other organizations For conducting a private inperson meeting at least one site recommends that the user switch the smartphone off and disconnect the battery Sleep Using smartphones late at night can disturb sleep due to the blue light and brightly lit screen which affects melatonin levels and sleep cycles In an effort to alleviate these issues Night Mode functionality to change the color temperature of a screen to a warmer hue based on the time of day to reduce the amount of blue light generated became available through several apps for Android and the flux software for jailbroken iPhones iOS 93 integrated a similar systemlevel feature known as Night Shift Several Android device manufacturers bypassed Googles initial reluctance to make Night Mode a standard feature in Android and included software for it on their hardware under varying names before Android Oreo added it to the OS for compatible devices It has also been theorized that for some users addiction to use of their phones especially before they go to bed can result in ego depletion Many people also use their phones as alarm clocks which can also lead to loss of sleep Replacement of dedicated digital cameras As the 2010s decade commenced the sale figures of dedicated compact cameras decreased sharply since mobile phone cameras were increasingly perceived as serving as a sufficient surrogate camera Increases in computing power in mobile phones enabled fast image processing and highresolution filming with 1080p Full HD being achieved in 2011 and the barrier to 2160p 4K being breached in 2013 However due to design and space limitations smartphones lack several features found even on lowbudget compact cameras including a hotswappable memory card and battery for nearly uninterrupted operation physical buttons and knobs for focusing and capturing and zooming a bolt thread tripod mount a capacitorcharged xenon flash that exceeds the brightness of smartphones LED flashlights and an ergonomic grip for steadier holding during handheld shooting which enables longer exposure times Since dedicated cameras can be more spacious they can house larger image sensors and feature optical zooming Since the late 2010s smartphone manufacturers have bypassed the lack of optical zoom to a limited extent by incorporating additional rear cameras with fixed magnification levels Lifespan In mobile phones released since the second half of the 2010s operational life span commonly is limited by builtin batteries which are not designed to be interchangeable The life expectancy of batteries depends on usage intensity of the powered device where activity longer usage and tasks demanding more energy expire the battery earlier Lithiumion and lithiumpolymer batteries those commonly powering portable electronics additionally wear down more from fuller charge and deeper discharge cycles and when unused for an extended amount of time while depleted where selfdischarging may lead to a harmful depth of discharge Manufacturers have prevented some smartphones from operating after repairs by associating components unique serial numbers to the device so it will refuse to operate or disable some functionality in case of a mismatch that would occur after a replacement Locking of the serial number was first documented in 2015 on the iPhone 6 which would become inoperable from a detected replacement of the home button Later some functionality was restricted on Apple and Samsung smartphones when a battery replacement not authorized by the vendor was detected See also Notes References External links Media related to Smartphone at Wikimedia Commons",

    title: "Malaria",
    originalContent:
      "Malaria is a mosquitoborne infectious disease that affects vertebrates and Anopheles mosquitoes Human malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever fatigue vomiting and headaches In severe cases it can cause jaundice seizures coma or death Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15 days after being bitten by an infected Anopheles mosquito If not properly treated people may have recurrences of the disease months later In those who have recently survived an infection reinfection usually causes milder symptoms This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria The mosquito vector is itself harmed by Plasmodium infections causing reduced lifespan Human malaria is caused by singlecelled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group It is spread exclusively through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquitos saliva into a persons blood The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce Five species of Plasmodium commonly infect humans The three species associated with more severe cases are P falciparum which is responsible for the vast majority of malaria deaths P vivax and P knowlesi a simian malaria that spills over into thousands of people a year P ovale and P malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films or with antigenbased rapid diagnostic tests Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasites DNA have been developed but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents or with mosquitocontrol measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water Several medications are available to prevent malaria for travellers in areas where the disease is common Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxinepyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria As of 2023 two malaria vaccines have been endorsed by the World Health Organization The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes artemisinin The second medication may be either mefloquine lumefantrine or sulfadoxinepyrimethamine Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if artemisinin is not available In areas where the disease is common malaria should be confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications for example chloroquineresistant P falciparum has spread to most malarial areas and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia The disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator This includes much of subSaharan Africa Asia and Latin America In 2022 some 249 million cases of malaria worldwide resulted in an estimated 608000 deaths with 80 percent being five years old or less Around 95 of the cases and deaths occurred in subSaharan Africa Rates of disease decreased from 2010 to 2014 but increased from 2015 to 2021 According to UNICEF nearly every minute a child under five died of malaria in 2021 and many of these deaths are preventable and treatable Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a significant negative effect on economic development In Africa it is estimated to result in losses of US12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs lost ability to work and adverse effects on tourism The malaria caseload in India was slashed by 69 per cent from 64 million 64 lakh in 2017 to two million 20 lakh in 2023 Similarly the estimated malaria deaths decreased from 11100 to 3500 a 68per cent decrease in the same period Etymology The term malaria originates from Medieval Italian mala aria bad air a part of miasma theory the disease was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland The term appeared in English at least as early as 1768 Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America where it is no longer endemic though imported cases do occur The scientific study of malaria is called malariology Signs and symptoms Adults with malaria tend to experience chills and feverclassically in periodic intense bouts lasting around six hours followed by a period of sweating and fever reliefas well as headache fatigue abdominal discomfort and muscle pain Children tend to have more general symptoms fever cough vomiting and diarrhea Initial manifestations of the diseasecommon to all malaria speciesare similar to flulike symptoms and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis gastroenteritis and viral diseases The presentation may include headache fever shivering joint pain vomiting hemolytic anemia jaundice hemoglobin in the urine retinal damage and convulsions The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysma cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating occurring every two days tertian fever in P vivax and P ovale infections and every three days quartan fever for P malariae P falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 3648 hours or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever Symptoms typically begin 1015 days after the initial mosquito bite but can occur as late as several months after infection with some P vivax strains Travellers taking preventative malaria medications may develop symptoms once they stop taking the drugs Severe malaria is usually caused by P falciparum often referred to as falciparum malaria Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 930 days after infection Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms including abnormal posturing nystagmus conjugate gaze palsy failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction opisthotonus seizures or coma Diagnosis based on skin odor profiles Humans emanate a large range of smells Studies have been conducted on how to detect human malaria infections through volatile compounds from the skin suggesting that volatile biomarkers may be a reliable source for the detection of infection including those asymptomatic Using skin body odor profiles can be efficient in diagnosing global populations and the screening and monitoring of infection to officially eradicate malaria Research findings have predominantly relied on chemical explanations to explain the differences in attractiveness among humans based on distinct odor profiles The existence of volatile compounds like fatty acids and lactic acid is an essential reason on why some individuals are more appealing to mosquitos than others Volatile compounds Kanika Khanna a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California Berkeley studying the structural basis of membrane manipulation and cellcell fusion by bacterial pathogens discusses studies that determine how odor profiles can be used to diagnose the disease Within the study samples of volatile compounds from around 400 children within schools in Western Kenya were collected to identify asymptomatic infections These biomarkers have been established as a noninvasive way to detect malarial infections In addition these volatile compounds were heavily detected by mosquito antennae as an attractant making the children more vulnerable to the bite of the mosquitos Fatty acids Fatty acids have been identified as an attractive compound for mosquitoes they are typically found in volatile emissions from the skin These fatty acids that produce body odor profiles originate from the metabolism of glycerol lactic acid amino acids and lipids through the action of bacteria found within the skin They create a chemical signature for the mosquitoes to locate a potential host humans in particular Lactic acid Lactic acid a naturally produced levorotatory isomer has been titled an attractant of mosquitoes for a long time Lactic acid is predominantly produced by eccrinesweat glands creating a large amount of sweat on the surface of the skin Due to the high levels of lactic acid released from the human body it has been hypothesized to represent a specific human hostrecognition cue for anthropophilic attracted to humans mosquitoes Pungent foot odor Most studies use human odors as stimuli to attract host seeking mosquitoes and have reported a strong and significant attractive effect The studies have found human odor samples very effective in attracting mosquitoes Foot odors have been demonstrated to have the highest attractiveness to anthropophilic mosquitoes Some of these studies have included traps that had been baited with nylon socks previously worn by human participants and were deemed efficient in catching adult mosquitos Foot odors have high numbers of volatile compounds which in turn elicit an olfactory response from mosquitoes Complications Malaria has several serious complications including the development of respiratory distress which occurs in up to 25 of adults and 40 of children with severe P falciparum malaria Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema concomitant pneumonia and severe anaemia Although rare in young children with severe malaria acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 525 of adults and up to 29 of pregnant women Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality Kidney failure is a feature of blackwater fever where haemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine Infection with P falciparum may result in cerebral malaria a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy It is associated with retinal whitening which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever An enlarged spleen enlarged liver or both of these severe headache low blood sugar and haemoglobin in the urine with kidney failure may occur Complications may include spontaneous bleeding coagulopathy and shock Malaria during pregnancy can cause stillbirths infant mortality miscarriage and low birth weight particularly in P falciparum infection but also with P vivax Cause Malaria is caused by infection with parasites in the genus Plasmodium In humans malaria is caused by six Plasmodium species P falciparum P malariae P ovale curtisi P ovale wallikeri P vivax and P knowlesi Among those infected P falciparum is the most common species identified 75 followed by P vivax 20 Although P falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths recent evidence suggests that P vivax malaria is associated with potentially lifethreatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P falciparum infection P vivax proportionally is more common outside Africa Some cases have been documented of human infections with several species of Plasmodium from higher apes but except for P knowlesia zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaquesthese are mostly of limited public health importance The Anopheles mosquitos initially get infected by Plasmodium by taking a blood meal from a previously Plasmodium infected person or animal Parasites are then typically introduced by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito Some of these inoculated parasites called sporozoites probably remain in the skin but others travel in the bloodstream to the liver where they invade hepatocytes They grow and divide in the liver for 210 days with each infected hepatocyte eventually harboring up to 40000 parasites The infected hepatocytes break down releasing these invasive Plasmodium cells called merozoites into the bloodstream In the blood the merozoites rapidly invade individual red blood cells replicating over 2472 hours to form 1632 new merozoites The infected red blood cell lyses and the new merozoites infect new red blood cells resulting in a cycle that continuously amplifies the number of parasites in an infected person Over rounds of this infection cycle a small portion of parasites do not replicate but instead develop into early sexual stage parasites called male and female gametocytes These gametocytes develop in the bone marrow for 11 days then return to the blood circulation to await uptake by the bite of another mosquito Once inside a mosquito the gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction and eventually form daughter sporozoites that migrate to the mosquitos salivary glands to be injected into a new host when the mosquito bites The liver infection causes no symptoms all symptoms of malaria result from the infection of red blood cells Symptoms develop once there are more than around 100000 parasites per milliliter of blood Many of the symptoms associated with severe malaria are caused by the tendency of P falciparum to bind to blood vessel walls resulting in damage to the affected vessels and surrounding tissue Parasites sequestered in the blood vessels of the lung contribute to respiratory failure In the brain they contribute to coma In the placenta they contribute to low birthweight and preterm labor and increase the risk of abortion and stillbirth The destruction of red blood cells during infection often results in anemia exacerbated by reduced production of new red blood cells during infection Only female mosquitoes feed on blood male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease Females of the mosquito genus Anopheles prefer to feed at night They usually start searching for a meal at dusk and continue through the night until they succeed However in Africa due to the extensive use of bed nets they began to bite earlier before bednet time Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by blood transfusions although this is rare Recurrent malaria Symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptomfree periods Depending upon the cause recurrence can be classified as either recrudescence relapse or reinfection Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptomfree period due to failure to remove bloodstage parasites by adequate treatment Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from the blood but have persisted as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells Relapse commonly occurs between 8 and 24 weeks after the initial symptoms and is often seen in P vivax and P ovale infections P vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite Reinfection means that parasites were eliminated from the entire body but new parasites were then introduced Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from relapse and recrudescence although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment ending is typically attributed to treatment failure People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections Pathophysiology Malaria infection develops via two phases one that involves the liver exoerythrocytic phase and one that involves red blood cells or erythrocytes erythrocytic phase When an infected mosquito pierces a persons skin to take a blood meal sporozoites in the mosquitos saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 830 days After a potential dormant period in the liver these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites which following rupture of their host cells escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell Within the red blood cells the parasites multiply further again asexually periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells Several such amplification cycles occur Thus classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells Some P vivax sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocyticphase merozoites but instead produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months 710 months is typical to several years After a period of dormancy they reactivate and produce merozoites Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in P vivax infections although their existence in P ovale is uncertain The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the bodys immune system because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance However circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen To avoid this fate the P falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as those in placental malaria Sequestered red blood cells can breach the bloodbrain barrier and cause cerebral malaria Genetic resistance Due to the high levels of mortality and morbidity caused by malariaespecially the P falciparum speciesit has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait thalassaemia traits glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary tradeoffs that have occurred because of endemic malaria Sickle cell trait causes a change in the haemoglobin molecule in the blood Normally red blood cells have a very flexible biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries however when the modified haemoglobin S molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen or crowd together due to dehydration they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to distort into a curved sickle shape In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely In the early stages of malaria the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle and so they are removed from circulation sooner This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell Individuals who are homozygous with two copies of the abnormal haemoglobin beta allele have sicklecell anaemia while those who are heterozygous with one abnormal allele and one normal allele experience resistance to malaria without severe anaemia Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavour the traits survival the trait is preserved in malariaprone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form Liver dysfunction Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis While it has been considered a rare occurrence malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase particularly in Southeast Asia and India Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death Effects on vaccine response Malaria infection affects the immune responses following vaccination for various diseases For example malaria suppresses immune responses to polysaccharide vaccines A potential solution is to give curative treatment before vaccination in areas where malaria is present Diagnosis Due to the nonspecific nature of malaria symptoms diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and travel history then confirmed with a laboratory test to detect the presence of the parasite in the blood parasitological test In areas where malaria is common the World Health Organization WHO recommends clinicians suspect malaria in any person who reports having fevers or who has a current temperature above 375 C without any other obvious cause Malaria should be suspected in children with signs of anemia pale palms or a laboratory test showing hemoglobin levels below 8 grams per deciliter of blood In areas of the world with little to no malaria the WHO recommends only testing people with possible exposure to malaria typically travel to a malariaendemic area and unexplained fever In subSaharan Africa testing is low with only about one in four 28 of children with a fever receiving medical advice or a rapid diagnostic test in 2021 There was a 10percentage point gap in testing between the richest and the poorest children 33 vs 23 Additionally a greater proportion of children in Eastern and Southern Africa 36 were tested than in West and Central Africa 21 According to UNICEF 61 of children with a fever were taken for advice or treatment from a health facility or provider in 2021 Disparities are also observed by wealth with an 18 percentage point difference in careseeking behaviour between children in the richest 71 and the poorest 53 households Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigenbased rapid diagnostic tests RDT Microscopyie examining Giemsastained blood with a light microscopeis the gold standard for malaria diagnosis Microscopists typically examine both a thick film of blood allowing them to scan many blood cells in a short time and a thin film of blood allowing them to clearly see individual parasites and identify the infecting Plasmodium species Under typical field laboratory conditions a microscopist can detect parasites when there are at least 100 parasites per microliter of blood which is around the lower range of symptomatic infection Microscopic diagnosis is relatively resource intensive requiring trained personnel specific equipment electricity and a consistent supply of microscopy slides and stains In places where microscopy is unavailable malaria is diagnosed with RDTs rapid antigen tests that detect parasite proteins in a fingerstick blood sample A variety of RDTs are commercially available targeting the parasite proteins histidine rich protein 2 HRP2 detects P falciparum only lactate dehydrogenase or aldolase The HRP2 test is widely used in Africa where P falciparum predominates However since HRP2 persists in the blood for up to five weeks after an infection is treated an HRP2 test sometimes cannot distinguish whether someone currently has malaria or previously had it Additionally some P falciparum parasites in the Amazon region lack the HRP2 gene complicating detection RDTs are fast and easily deployed to places without full diagnostic laboratories However they give considerably less information than microscopy and sometimes vary in quality from producer to producer and lot to lot Serological tests to detect antibodies against Plasmodium from the blood have been developed but are not used for malaria diagnosis due to their relatively poor sensitivity and specificity Highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed but are not used clinically due to their relatively high cost and poor specificity for active infections Classification Malaria is classified into either severe or uncomplicated by the World Health Organization WHO It is deemed severe when any of the following criteria are present otherwise it is considered uncomplicated Decreased consciousness Significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk Inability to feed Two or more convulsions Low blood pressure less than 70 mmHg in adults and 50 mmHg in children Breathing problems Circulatory shock Kidney failure or hemoglobin in the urine Bleeding problems or hemoglobin less than 50 gL 5 gdL Pulmonary oedema Blood glucose less than 22 mmolL 40 mgdL Acidosis or lactate levels of greater than 5 mmolL A parasite level in the blood of greater than 100000 per microlitre L in lowintensity transmission areas or 250000 per L in highintensity transmission areas Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe P falciparummalaria presenting with neurological symptoms including coma with a Glasgow coma scale less than 11 or a Blantyre coma scale less than 3 or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure Prevention Methods used to prevent malaria include medications mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites As of 2023 there are two malaria vaccines approved for use in children by the WHO RTSS and R21 The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density high Anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans If any of these is lowered sufficiently the parasite eventually disappears from that area as happened in North America Europe and parts of the Middle East However unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world it could reestablish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasites reproduction Furthermore the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density making it economically unfeasible in some areas Prevention of malaria may be more costeffective than treatment of the disease in the long run but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the worlds poorest people There is a wide difference in the costs of control ie maintenance of low endemicity and elimination programs between countries For example in Chinawhose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provincesthe required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health In contrast a similar programme in Tanzania would cost an estimated onefifth of the public health budget In 2021 the World Health Organization confirmed that China has eliminated malaria In 2023 the World Health Organization confirmed that Azerbaijan Tajikistan and Belize have eliminated malaria In areas where malaria is common children under five years old often have anaemia which is sometimes due to malaria Giving children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation Mosquito control Vector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes For individual protection the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin However there is insufficient evidence that mosquito repellents can prevent malaria infection Insecticidetreated nets ITNs and indoor residual spraying IRS are effective have been commonly used to prevent malaria and their use has contributed significantly to the decrease in malaria in the 21st century ITNs and IRS may not be sufficient to eliminate the disease as these interventions depend on how many people use nets how many gaps in insecticide there are low coverage areas if people are not protected when outside of the home and an increase in mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides Modifications to peoples houses to prevent mosquito exposure may be an important long term prevention measure Insecticidetreated nets Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net Insecticidetreated nets ITNs are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70 protection compared with no net Between 2000 and 2008 the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250000 infants in SubSaharan Africa According to UNICEF only 36 of households had sufficient ITNs for all household members in 2019 In 2000 17 million 18 African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN That number increased to 203 million 185 African children using ITNs in 2007 leaving 896 million children unprotected and to 68 African children using mosquito nets in 2015 The percentage of children sleeping under ITNs in subSaharan Africa increased from less than 40 in 2011 to over 50 in 2021 Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids a class of insecticides with low toxicity They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn It is recommended to hang a large bed net above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground ITNs are beneficial towards pregnancy outcomes in malariaendemic regions in Africa but more data is needed in Asia and Latin America In areas of high malaria resistance piperonyl butoxide PBO combined with pyrethroids in mosquito netting is effective in reducing malaria infection rates Questions remain concerning the durability of PBO on nets as the impact on mosquito mortality was not sustained after twenty washes in experimental trials UNICEF notes that the use of insecticidetreated nets has been increased since 2000 through accelerated production procurement and delivery stating that over 25 billion ITNs have been distributed globally since 2004 with 87 22 billion distributed in subSaharan Africa In 2021 manufacturers delivered about 220 million ITNs to malaria endemic countries a decrease of 9 million ITNs compared with 2020 and 33 million less than were delivered in 2019 As of 2021 66 of households in subSaharan Africa had ITNs with figures ranging from 31 per cent in Angola in 2016 to approximately 97 per cent in GuineaBissau in 2019 Slightly more than half of the households with an ITN had enough of them to protect all members of the household however Indoor residual spraying Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home After feeding many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite As of 2006 the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention which prohibits its agricultural use One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors and due to the irritation caused by spraying their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors meaning that they are less affected by the IRS Communities using insecticide treated nets in addition to indoor residual spraying with nonpyrethroidlike insecticides found associated reductions in malaria Additionally the use of pyrethroidlike insecticides in addition to indoor residual spraying did not result in a detectable additional benefit in communities using insecticide treated nets Housing modifications Housing is a risk factor for malaria and modifying the house as a prevention measure may be a sustainable strategy that does not rely on the effectiveness of insecticides such as pyrethroids The physical environment inside and outside the home that may improve the density of mosquitoes are considerations Examples of potential modifications include how close the home is to mosquito breeding sites drainage and water supply near the home availability of mosquito resting sites vegetation around the home the proximity to live stock and domestic animals and physical improvements or modifications to the design of the home to prevent mosquitoes from entering such as window screens In addition to installing window screens house screening measures include screening ceilings doors and eaves In 2021 the World Health Organizations WHO Guideline Development Group conditionally recommended screening houses in this manner to reduce malaria transmission However the WHO does point out that there are local considerations that need to be addressed when incorporating these techniques These considerations include the delivery method maintenance house design feasibility resource needs and scalability Several studies have suggested that screening houses can have a significant impact on malaria transmission Beyond the protective barrier screening provides it also does not call for daily behavioral changes in the household Screening eaves can also have a communitylevel protective effect ultimately reducing mosquitobiting densities in neighboring houses that do not have this intervention in place In some cases studies have used insecticidetreated eg transfluthrin or untreated netting to deter mosquito entry One widely used intervention is the In2Care BV EaveTube In 2021 In2Care BV received funding from the United States Agency for International Development to develop a ventilation tube that would be installed in housing walls When mosquitoes approach households the goal is for them to encounter these EaveTubes instead Inside these EaveTubes is insecticidetreated netting that is lethal to insecticideresistant mosquitoes This approach to mosquito control is called the Lethal House Lure method The WHO is currently evaluating the efficacy of this product for widespread use Mass drug administration Mass drug administration MDA involves the administration of drugs to the entire population of an area regardless of disease status A 2021 Cochrane review on the use of community administration of ivermectin found that to date low quality evidence shows no significant impact on reducing incidence of malaria transmission from the community administration of ivermectin Mosquitotargeted drug delivery One potential way to reduce the burden of malaria is to target the infection in mosquitoes before it enters the mammalian host during sporogeny Drugs may be used for this purpose which have unacceptable toxicity profiles in humans For example aminoquinoline derivates show toxicity in humans but this has not been shown in mosquitoes Primaquine is particularly effective against Plasmodium gametocytes Likewise pyrroloquinazolinediamines show unacceptable toxicity in mammals but it is unknown whether this is the case in mosquitoes Pyronaridine thiostrepton and pyrimethamine have been shown to dramatically reduce ookinete formation in P berghei while artefenomel NPC1161B and tertbutyl isoquine reduce exflagellation in P Falciparum Other mosquito control methods People have tried a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria Efforts to decrease mosquito larvae by decreasing the availability of open water where they develop or by adding substances to decrease their development are effective in some locations Electronic mosquito repellent devices which make very highfrequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away have no supporting evidence of effectiveness There is a low certainty evidence that fogging may have an effect on malaria transmission Larviciding by hand delivery of chemical or microbial insecticides into water bodies containing low larval distribution may reduce malarial transmission There is insufficient evidence to determine whether larvivorous fish can decrease mosquito density and transmission in the area Medications There are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travellers to places where infection is common Many of these medications are also used in treatment In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications three medicationsmefloquine doxycycline or the combination of atovaquoneproguanil Malaroneare frequently used for prevention Doxycycline and the atovaquoneproguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week Areas of the world with chloroquinesensitive malaria are uncommon Antimalarial mass drug administration to an entire population at the same time may reduce the risk of contracting malaria in the population however the effectiveness of mass drug administration may vary depending on the prevalence of malaria in the area Other factors such as drug administration plus other protective measures such as mosquito control the proportion of people treated in the area and the risk of reinfection with malaria may play a role in the effectiveness of mass drug treatment approaches The protective effect does not begin immediately and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving except for atovaquoneproguanil which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward The use of preventive drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists and their use is usually given only to pregnant women and shortterm visitors This is due to the cost of the drugs side effects from longterm use and the difficulty in obtaining antimalarial drugs outside of wealthy nations During pregnancy medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anaemia in the mother The use of preventive drugs where malariabearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance Giving antimalarial drugs to infants through intermittent preventive therapy can reduce the risk of having malaria infection hospital admission and anaemia Mefloquine is more effective than sulfadoxinepyrimethamine in preventing malaria for HIVnegative pregnant women Cotrimoxazole is effective in preventing malaria infection and reduce the risk of getting anaemia in HIVpositive women Giving Dihydroartemisininpiperaquine and mefloquine in addition to the daily cotrimoxazole to HIVpositive pregnant women seem to be more efficient in preventing malaria infection than cotrimoxazole alone Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisininbased combination therapies ACTs may also reduce transmission Research on malaria vaccines Malaria vaccines have been another goal of research The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunising mice with live radiationattenuated sporozoites which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal viable sporozoites Since the 1970s there has been considerable progress in developing similar vaccination strategies for humans In 2013 WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with malaria eradications longterm goal The first vaccine called RTSS was approved by European regulators in 2015 As of 2023 two malaria vaccines have been licensed for use Other approaches to combat malaria may require investing more in research and greater primary health care Continuing surveillance will also be important to prevent the return of malaria in countries where the disease has been eliminated As of 2019 it is undergoing pilot trials in 3 subSaharan African countriesGhana Kenya and Malawias part of the WHOs Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme MVIP Immunity or more accurately tolerance to P falciparum malaria does occur naturally but only in response to years of repeated infection An individual can be protected from a P falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered noninfective by a dose of Xray irradiation The highly polymorphic nature of many P falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes zygotes or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria These transmissionblocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito Other vaccine candidates targeting the bloodstage of the parasites life cycle have been inadequate on their own For example SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease was common in the 1990s but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective As of 2020 the RTSS vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of malaria by about 40 in children in Africa A preprint study of the R21 vaccine has shown 77 vaccine efficacy In 2021 researchers from the University of Oxford reported findings from a Phase IIb trial of a candidate malaria vaccine R21MatrixM which demonstrated efficacy of 77 over 12months of followup This vaccine is the first to meet the World Health Organizations Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap goal of a vaccine with at least 75 efficacy Germanybased BioNTECH SE is developing an mRNAbased malaria vaccine BN165 which has recently initiated a Phase 1 study clinicaltrialsgov identifier NCT05581641 in December 2022 The vaccine based on the circumsporozite protein CSP is being tested in adults aged 1855 yrs at 3 dose levels to select a safe and tolerable dose of a threedose schedule Unlike GSKs RTSS AS01 and Serum Institute of Indias R21MatrixM BNT165 is being studied in adult age groups meaning it could be developed for Western travelers as well as those living in endemic countries For the travelers profile a recent commercial assessment forecast potential gross revenues of BNT165 at 479m 2030 5yrs post launch POSadjusted revenues Others Community participation and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world Recognising the disease in the early stages can prevent it from becoming fatal Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant still water such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas Intermittent preventive therapy is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal Treatment Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications the ones used depend on the type and severity of the disease While medications against fever are commonly used their effects on outcomes are not clear Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately Programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever Nevertheless the use of malaria rapiddiagnostic kits can help to reduce overusage of antimalarials Uncomplicated malaria Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications Artemisinin drugs are effective and safe in treating uncomplicated malaria Artemisinin in combination with other antimalarials known as artemisinincombination therapy or ACT is about 90 effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria The most effective treatment for P falciparum infection is the use of ACT which decreases resistance to any single drug component Artemetherlumefantrine sixdose regimen is more effective than the artemetherlumefantrine fourdose regimen or other regimens not containing artemisinin derivatives in treating falciparum malaria Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine Artemisininnaphthoquine combination therapy showed promising results in treating falciparum malaria but more research is needed to establish its efficacy as a reliable treatment Artesunate plus mefloquine performs better than mefloquine alone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in low transmission settings Atovaquoneproguanil is effective against uncomplicated falciparum with a possible failure rate of 5 to 10 the addition of artesunate may reduce failure rate Azithromycin monotherapy or combination therapy has not shown effectiveness in treating Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria Amodiaquine plus sulfadoxinepyrimethamine may achieve less treatment failures when compared to sulfadoxinepyrimethamine alone in uncomplicated falciparum malaria There is insufficient data on chlorproguanildapsone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria The addition of primaquine with artemisininbased combination therapy for falciparum malaria reduces its transmission at day 34 and day 8 of infection Sulfadoxinepyrimethamine plus artesunate is better than sulfadoxinepyrimethamine plus amodiaquine in controlling treatment failure at day 28 However the latter is better than the former in reducing gametocytes in blood at day 7 Infection with P vivax P ovale or P malariae usually does not require hospitalisation Treatment of P vivax malaria requires both elimination of the parasite in the blood with chloroquine or with artemisininbased combination therapy and clearance of parasites from the liver with an 8aminoquinoline agent such as primaquine or tafenoquine These two drugs act against blood stages as well the extent to which they do so still being under investigation To treat malaria during pregnancy the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy 1st trimester and ACT in later stages 2nd and 3rd trimesters There is limited safety data on the antimalarial drugs in pregnancy Severe and complicated malaria Cases of severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with P falciparum The other species usually cause only febrile disease Severe and complicated malaria cases are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high 10 to 50 Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs For severe malaria parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults In another systematic review artemisinin derivatives artemether and arteether were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort low blood sugar and low blood potassium Artemisinin derivatives have the same or better efficacy than quinolones in preventing deaths in severe or complicated malaria Quinine loading dose helps to shorten the duration of fever and increases parasite clearance from the body There is no difference in effectiveness when using intrarectal quinine compared to intravenous or intramuscular quinine in treating uncomplicatedcomplicated falciparum malaria There is insufficient evidence for intramuscular arteether to treat severe malaria The provision of rectal artesunate before transfer to hospital may reduce the rate of death for children with severe malaria In children with malaria and concomitant hypoglycaemia sublingual administration of glucose appears to result in better increases in blood sugar after 20 minutes when compared to oral administration based on very limited data Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms There is insufficient data on whether osmotic agents such as mannitol or urea are effective in treating cerebral malaria Routine phenobarbitone in cerebral malaria is associated with fewer convulsions but possibly more deaths There is no evidence that steroids would bring treatment benefits for cerebral malaria Managing cerebral malaria Cerebral malaria usually makes a patient comatose If the cause of the coma is in doubt testing for other locally prevalent causes of encephalopathy bacterial viral or fungal infection should be carried out In areas where there is a high prevalence of malaria infection eg tropical region treatment can start without testing first To manage the cerebral malaria when confirmed the following can be done People who are in coma should be given meticulous nursing care monitor vital signs turn patient every 2 hours avoid lying the patient in a wet bed etc A sterile urethral catheter should be inserted to help with urinating To aspirate stomach content a sterile nasogastric tube should be inserted In the occasion of convulsions a slow intravenous injection of benzodiazepine is administered There is insufficient evidence to show that blood transfusion is useful in either reducing deaths for children with severe anaemia or in improving their haematocrit in one month There is insufficient evidence that iron chelating agents such as deferoxamine and deferiprone improve outcomes of those with malaria falciparum infection Monoclonal antibodies A 2022 clinical trial shows that a monoclonal antibody mAb L9LS offers protection against malaria It binds the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein CSP1 essential to disease and makes it ineffective Resistance Drug resistance poses a growing problem in 21stcentury malaria treatment In the 2000s decade malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world Malaria strains found on the CambodiaThailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins and may therefore be untreatable Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia Myanmar Thailand and Vietnam and there has been emerging resistance in Laos Resistance to the combination of artemisinin and piperaquine was first detected in 2013 in Cambodia and by 2019 had spread across Cambodia and into Laos Thailand and Vietnam with up to 80 percent of malaria parasites resistant in some regions There is insufficient evidence in unit packaged antimalarial drugs in preventing treatment failures of malaria infection However if supported by training of healthcare providers and patient information there is improvement in compliance of those receiving treatment Prognosis When properly treated people with malaria can usually expect a complete recovery However severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days In the most severe cases of the disease fatality rates can reach 20 even with intensive care and treatment Over the longer term developmental impairments have been documented in children who have had episodes of severe malaria Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immunedeficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the EpsteinBarr virus During childhood malaria causes anaemia during a period of rapid brain development and also direct brain damage resulting from cerebral malaria Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits behavioural disorders and epilepsy Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups Epidemiology The WHO estimates that in 2021 there were 247 million total cases of malaria resulting in 619000 deaths Children under five years old are the most affected accounting for 67 of malaria deaths worldwide in 2019 About 125 million pregnant women are at risk of infection each year in SubSaharan Africa maternal malaria is associated with up to 200000 estimated infant deaths yearly Since 2015 the WHO European Region has been free of malaria The last country to report an indigenous malaria case was Tajikistan in 2014 There are about 13001500 malaria cases per year in the United States The United States eradicated malaria as a major public health concern in 1951 though small outbreaks persist Locally acquired mosquitoborne malaria occurred in the United States in 2003 when eight cases of locally acquired P vivax malaria were identified in Florida and again in May 2023 in four cases as well as one case in Texas and in August in one case in Maryland About 900 people died from the disease in Europe between 1993 and 2003 Both the global incidence of disease and resulting mortality have declined in recent years According to the WHO and UNICEF deaths attributable to malaria in 2015 were reduced by 60 from a 2000 estimate of 985000 largely due to the widespread use of insecticidetreated nets and artemisininbased combination therapies Between 2000 and 2019 malaria mortality rates among all ages halved from about 30 to 13 per 100000 population at risk During this period malaria deaths among children under five also declined by nearly half 47 from 781000 in 2000 to 416000 in 2019 Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator in areas of the Americas many parts of Asia and much of Africa in SubSaharan Africa 8590 of malaria fatalities occur An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100000 of population were Ivory Coast 8615 Angola 5693 and Burkina Faso 5066 A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso Mozambique and Mali The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global levels of malaria providing a way to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden This effort led to the publication of a map of P falciparum endemicity in 2010 and an update in 2019 As of 2021 84 countries have endemic malaria The geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex and malariaafflicted and malariafree areas are often found close to each other Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall consistent high temperatures and high humidity along with stagnant waters where mosquito larvae readily mature providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding In drier areas outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall Malaria is more common in rural areas than in cities For example several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia are essentially malariafree but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions including along international borders and forest fringes In contrast malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas though the risk is lower in the larger cities Climate change Climate change is likely to affect malaria transmission but the degree of effect and the areas affected is uncertain Greater rainfall in certain areas of India and following an El Nio event is associated with increased mosquito numbers Since 1900 there has been substantial change in temperature and rainfall over Africa However factors that contribute to how rainfall results in water for mosquito breeding are complex incorporating the extent to which it is absorbed into soil and vegetation for example or rates of runoff and evaporation Recent research has provided a more indepth picture of conditions across Africa combining a malaria climatic suitability model with a continentalscale model representing realworld hydrological processes History Although the parasite responsible for P falciparum malaria has been in existence for 50000100000 years the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10000 years ago concurrently with advances in agriculture and the development of human settlements Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees Some evidence suggests that the P falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout history Ancient Indian physician Sushruta is believed to be among the first to attribute the disease to mosquitoes long before the Roman Columella associated the disease with insects from swamps Hippocrates described periodic fevers labelling them tertian quartan subtertian and quotidian Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the Roman fever Several regions in ancient Rome were considered atrisk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors This included areas such as southern Italy the island of Sardinia the Pontine Marshes the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds Irrigated gardens swamplike grounds runoff from agriculture and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water Malaria is not referenced in the medical books of the Mayans or Aztecs Despite this antibodies against malaria have been detected in some South American mummies indicating that some malaria strains in the Americas might have a preColumbian origin European settlers and the West Africans they enslaved likely brought malaria to the Americas starting in the 16th century Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880 when Charles Louis Alphonse Laverana French army doctor working in the military hospital of Constantine in Algeriaobserved parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time He therefore proposed that malaria is caused by this organism the first time a protist was identified as causing disease For this and later discoveries he was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine A year later Carlos Finlay a Cuban doctor treating people with yellow fever in Havana provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans This work followed earlier suggestions by Josiah C Nott and work by Sir Patrick Manson the father of tropical medicine on the transmission of filariasis In April 1894 a Scottish physician Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street London This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta proved the complete lifecycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds For this work Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine After resigning from the Indian Medical Service Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malariacontrol efforts in Egypt Panama Greece and Mauritius The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900 Its recommendations were implemented by William C Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal This publichealth work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future publichealth campaigns against the disease In 1896 Amico Bignami discussed the role of mosquitoes in malaria In 1898 Bignami Giovanni Battista Grassi and Giuseppe Bastianelli succeeded in showing experimentally the transmission of malaria in humans using infected mosquitoes to contract malaria themselves which they presented in November 1898 to the Accademia dei Lincei The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree which contains quinine This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes mainly in Peru The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control fever Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the Jesuits introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640 by 1677 it was included in the London Pharmacopoeia as an antimalarial treatment It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient quinine was extracted from the bark isolated and named by the French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaim Caventou Quinine was the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications began to appear In the 1940s chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s The medicinal value of Artemisia annua has been used by Chinese herbalists in traditional Chinese medicines for 2000 years In 1596 Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his Compendium of Materia Medica however the efficacy of tea made with A annua for the treatment of malaria is dubious and is discouraged by the World Health Organization WHO Artemisinins discovered by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou and colleagues in the 1970s from the plant Artemisia annua became the recommended treatment for P falciparum malaria administered in severe cases in combination with other antimalarials Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments written in 340 by Ge Hong For her work on malaria Tu Youyou received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Plasmodium vivax was used between 1917 and the 1940s for malariotherapydeliberate injection of malaria parasites to induce a fever to combat certain diseases such as tertiary syphilis In 1927 the inventor of this technique Julius WagnerJauregg received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries The technique was dangerous killing about 15 of patients so it is no longer in use The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was DDT Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria its use quickly spread to agriculture In time pest control rather than disease control came to dominate DDT use and this largescale agricultural use led to the evolution of pesticideresistant mosquitoes in many regions The DDT resistance shown by Anopheles mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria During the 1960s awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s Before DDT malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larval stages for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound Paris Green to places with standing water Names Various types of malaria have been called by the names below Eradication efforts Malaria has been successfully eliminated or significantly reduced in certain areas but not globally Malaria was once common in the United States but the US eliminated malaria from most parts of the country in the early 20th century using vector control programs which combined the monitoring and treatment of infected humans draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices and advances in sanitation including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings The use of the pesticide DDT and other means eliminated malaria from the remaining pockets in southern states of the US in the 1950s as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program Most of Europe North America Australia North Africa and the Caribbean and parts of South America Asia and Southern Africa have also eliminated malaria The WHO defines elimination or malariafree as having no domestic transmission indigenous cases for the past three years They also define preelimination and elimination stages when a country has fewer than 5 or 1 respectively cases per 1000 people at risk per year In 2021 the total of international and national funding for malaria control and elimination was 35 billiononly half of what is estimated to be needed According to UNICEF to achieve the goal of a malariafree world annual funding would need to more than double to reach the US68 billion target In parts of the world with rising living standards the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice These include antimalarial drugs to prevent or treat infection improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose sequester and treat infected individuals bednets and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans and vector control strategies such as larvaciding with insecticides ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and indoor residual spraying IRS with insecticides Initial WHO program 19551969 In 1955 the WHO launched the Global Malaria Eradication Program GMEP The program relied largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to break the transmission cycle The program eliminated the disease in North America Europe the former Soviet Union and in Taiwan much of the Caribbean the Balkans parts of northern Africa the northern region of Australia and a large swath of the South Pacific and dramatically reduced mortality in Sri Lanka and India However failure to sustain the program increasing mosquito tolerance to DDT and increasing parasite tolerance led to a resurgence In many areas early successes partially or completely reversed and in some cases rates of transmission increased Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors including poor leadership management and funding of malaria control programs poverty civil unrest and increased irrigation The evolution of resistance to firstgeneration drugs eg chloroquine and to insecticides exacerbated the situation The program succeeded in eliminating malaria only in areas with high socioeconomic status wellorganized healthcare systems and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission For example in Sri Lanka the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963 and 29 in 1964 Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600000 cases in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969 The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim presumably because of continued agricultural use The program switched to malathion but despite initial successes malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s Due to vector and parasite resistance and other factors the feasibility of eradicating malaria with the strategy used at the time and resources available led to waning support for the program WHO suspended the program in 1969 and attention instead focused on controlling and treating the disease Spraying programs especially using DDT were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects as well as problems in administrative managerial and financial implementation Efforts shifted from spraying to the use of bednets impregnated with insecticides and other interventions After 1969 Target 6C of the Millennium Development Goals included reversal of the global increase in malaria incidence by 2015 with specific targets for children under five years old Since 2000 support for malaria eradication increased although some actors in the global health community including voices within the WHO view malaria eradication as a premature goal and suggest that the establishment of strict deadlines for malaria eradication may be counterproductive as they are likely to be missed One of the targets of Goal 3 of the UNs Sustainable Development Goals is to end the malaria epidemic in all countries by 2030 In 2006 the organization Malaria No More set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015 and the organization claimed they planned to dissolve if that goal was accomplished In 2007 World Malaria Day was established by the 60th session of the World Health Assembly As of 2018 they are still functioning As of 2012 The Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria has distributed 230 million insecticidetreated nets intended to stop mosquitoborne transmission of malaria The USbased Clinton Foundation has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market Other efforts such as the Malaria Atlas Project focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict malaria spread based on the availability of habitat of malariacarrying parasites The Malaria Policy Advisory Committee MPAC of the World Health Organization WHO was formed in 2012 to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination In 2015 the WHO targeted a 90 reduction in malaria deaths by 2030 and Bill Gates said in 2016 that he thought global eradication would be possible by 2040 According to the WHOs World Malaria Report 2015 the global mortality rate for malaria fell by 60 between 2000 and 2015 The WHO targeted a further 90 reduction between 2015 and 2030 with a 40 reduction and eradication in 10 countries by 2020 However the 2020 goal was missed with a slight increase in cases compared to 2015 Additionally UNICEF reported that the number of malaria deaths for all ages increased by 10 between 2019 and 2020 in part due to service disruptions related to the COVID19 pandemic before experiencing a minor decline in 2021 Before 2016 the Global Fund against HIVAIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria had provided 659 million ITN insecticide treated bed nets organise support and education to prevents malaria The challenges are high due to the lack of funds the fragile health structure and the remote indigenous population that could be hard to reach and educate Most of indigenous population rely on selfdiagnosis selftreatment healer and traditional medicine The WHO applied for fund to the Gates Foundation which favour the action of malaria eradication in 2007 Six countries the United Arab Emirates Morocco Armenia Turkmenistan Kyrgyzstan and Sri Lanka managed to have no endemic cases of malaria for three consecutive years and certified malariafree by the WHO despite the stagnation of the funding in 2010 The funding is essential to finance the cost of medication and hospitalisation cannot be supported by the poor countries where the disease is widely spread The goal of eradication has not been met nevertheless the decrease rate of the disease is considerable While 31 out of 92 endemic countries were estimated to be on track with the WHO goals for 2020 15 countries reported an increase of 40 or more between 2015 and 2020 Between 2000 and 30 June 2021 twelve countries were certified by the WHO as being malariafree Argentina and Algeria were declared free of malaria in 2019 El Salvador and China were declared malariafree in the first half of 2021 Regional disparities were evident Southeast Asia was on track to meet WHOs 2020 goals while Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean and West Pacific regions were offtrack The six Greater Mekong Subregion countries aim for elimination of P falciparum transmitted malaria by 2025 and elimination of all malaria by 2030 having achieved a 97 and 90 reduction of cases respectively since 2000 Ahead of World Malaria Day 25 April 2021 WHO named 25 countries in which it is working to eliminate malaria by 2025 as part of its E2025 initiative A major challenge to malaria elimination is the persistence of malaria in border regions making international cooperation crucial In 2018 WHO announced that Paraguay was free of malaria after a national malaria eradication effort that began in 1950 In March 2023 the WHO certified Azerbaijan and Tajikistan as malariafree and Belize in June 2023 Cabo Verde the latest country to eradicate Malaria was certified in January 2024 bringing the total number of countries and territories certified malariafree to 44 In October 2024 the WHO certified Egypt to be malariafree Potential eradication of malaria by year 2050 Experts say that malaria could be eliminated as wild disease of humans by the year 2050 World class experts 41 of them in fields such as malariology biomedicine economics and health policy advocated more funding a central data repository for dealing with local outbreaks of malaria and training the workers needed to carry out the plan Details are published in The Lancet The report refers to current knowledge recent research and financial matters to describe a respectable plan The number of countries in which malaria was endemic was reduced from 200 to 86 in the years from 1900 to 2017 A further reduction by another 20 countries occurred by 2020 In light of the indication of possible practical accomplishment countries and regions are planning further progress Through the use of top notch diagnostic technique effective treatment and vector reduction the world should be nearly free of malaria by 2050 This will require technical improvements in organizational efficiency and more monetary outlays Society and culture Economic impact Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development Although tropical regions are most affected malarias furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread During the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states A comparison of average per capita GDP in 1995 adjusted for parity of purchasing power between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference US1526 versus US8268 In the period 1965 to 1990 countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 04 per year compared to 24 per year in other countries Poverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease In its entirety the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US12 billion every year The economic impact includes costs of health care working days lost due to sickness days lost in education decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria and loss of investment and tourism The disease has a heavy burden in some countries where it may be responsible for 3050 of hospital admissions up to 50 of outpatient visits and up to 40 of public health spending Cerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery Consequently severe and cerebral malaria have farreaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease Counterfeit and substandard drugs Sophisticated counterfeits have been found in several Asian countries such as Cambodia China Indonesia Laos Thailand and Vietnam and are a major cause of avoidable death in those countries The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40 of artesunatebased malaria medications are counterfeit especially in the Greater Mekong region They have established a rapid alert system to rapidly report information about counterfeit drugs to relevant authorities in participating countries There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution Another clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities poor quality ingredients poor stability and inadequate packaging A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly onethird of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and SubSaharan Africa failed chemical analysis packaging analysis or were falsified War Throughout history the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers nationstates military personnel and military actions In 1910 Nobel Prize in Medicinewinner Ronald Ross himself a malaria survivor published a book titled The Prevention of Malaria that included a chapter titled The Prevention of Malaria in War The chapters author Colonel C H Melville Professor of Hygiene at Royal Army Medical College in London addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself certainly the history of war in the Christian era It is probably the case that many of the socalled camp fevers and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery of the wars of the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin In Britishoccupied India the cocktail gin and tonic may have come about as a way of taking quinine known for its antimalarial properties Malaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by US troops in the South Pacific during World War II where about 500000 men were infected According to Joseph Patrick Byrne Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns Significant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new antimalarial agents During World War I and World War II inconsistent supplies of the natural antimalaria drugs cinchona bark and quinine prompted substantial funding into research and development of other drugs and vaccines American military organisations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases of the US Armed Forces Additionally initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas MCWA established in 1942 and its successor the Communicable Disease Center now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC established in 1946 According to the CDC MCWA was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories where malaria was still problematic Research The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda malERA initiative was a consultative process to identify which areas of research and development RD must be addressed for worldwide eradication of malaria Medications Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts organelles related to the plastids found in plants complete with their own genomes These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism such as fatty acid biosynthesis Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel antimalarial drugs With the onset of drugresistant Plasmodium parasites new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxalamino acid adducts which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metalbased complexes are attracting research interest SJ733 Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called spiroindolone It inhibits the ATP4 protein of infected red blood cells that cause the cells to shrink and become rigid like the aging cells This triggers the immune system to eliminate the infected cells from the system as demonstrated in a mouse model As of 2014 a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety profile in human is planned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute NITD246 and NITD609 Also belonged to the class of spiroindolone and target the ATP4 protein On the basis of molecular docking outcomes compounds 3j 4b 4h 4m were exhibited selectivity towards PfLDH The post docking analysis displayed stable dynamic behavior of all the selected compounds compared to Chloroquine The end state thermodynamics analysis stated 3j compound as a selective and potent PfLDH inhibitor New targets Targeting Plasmodium liverstage parasites selectively is emerging as an alternative strategy in the face of resistance to the latest frontline combination therapies against blood stages of the parasite In research conducted in 2019 using experimental analysis with knockout KO mutants of Plasmodium berghei the authors were able to identify genes that are potentially essential in the liver stage Moreover they generated a computational model to analyse preerytrocytic development and liverstage metabolism Combining both methods they identified seven metabolic subsystems that become essential compared to the blood stage Some of these metabolic pathways are fatty acid synthesis and elongation tricarboxylic acid amino acid and heme metabolism among others Specifically they studied three subsystems fatty acid synthesis and elongation and amino sugar biosynthesis For the first two pathways they demonstrated a clear dependence of the liver stage on its own fatty acid metabolism They proved for the first time the critical role of amino sugar biosynthesis in the liver stage of P berghei The uptake of Nacetylglucosamine appears to be limited in the liver stage being its synthesis needed for the parasite development These findings and the computational model provide a basis for the design of antimalarial therapies targeting metabolic proteins Genomic research The genome of Plasmodium falciparum was sequenced and published in the year 2002 A species of malaria plasmodium tends to have rather polymorphic antigens which can serve as immune system targets Some searches of P falciparum genes for hotspots of encoded variations found sections of genes that when tested proved to encode for antigens When such antigens are used for vaccine targets a strain of plasmodium with a different allele for the antigen can sometimes escape the immune response stimulated by the vaccine Two related viruses MaRNAV1 and MaRNAV2 in Plasmodium vivax and in avian Leucocytozoon respectively were found through RNASequencing of blood The finding of a virus infecting a human malaria plasmodium is a first discovery of its kind It should lead to better understanding of malaria biology Other A nonchemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes Advances in genetic engineering technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population Genomics is central to malaria research With the sequencing of P falciparum one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae and the human genome the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria life cycle can be studied Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission In one study a genetically modified strain of Anopheles stephensi was created that no longer supported malaria transmission and this resistance was passed down to mosquito offspring Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations for instance to combat or eliminate insects so they cannot transmit diseases in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria zika dengue and yellow fever In a study conducted in 2015 researchers observed a specific interaction between malaria and coinfection with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis a pulmonary migrating helminth in mice The coinfection was found to reduce the virulence of the Plasmodium parasite the causative agent of malaria This reduction was attributed to the nematode infection causing increased destruction of erythrocytes or red blood cells Given that Plasmodium has a predilection for older host erythrocytes the increased erythrocyte destruction and ensuing erythropoiesis result in a predominantly younger erythrocyte population which in turn leads to a decrease in Plasmodium population Notably this effect appears to be largely independent of the hosts immune control of Plasmodium Finally a review article published in December 2020 noted a correlation between malariaendemic regions and COVID19 case fatality rates The study found that on average regions where malaria is endemic reported lower COVID19 case fatality rates compared to regions without endemic malaria In 2017 a bacterial strain of the genus Serratia was genetically modified to prevent malaria in mosquitos and in 2023 it has been reported that the bacterium Delftia tsuruhatensis naturally prevents the development of malaria by secreting a molecule called Harmane Other avenue that can contribute to understanding of malaria transmission is the source of meal for the vector when they have the parasites Its known that plant sugars are the primary source of nutrients for survival of adult mosquitoes therefore utilising this link for management of the vector will contribute in mitigating malaria transmission Other animals While none of the main four species of malaria parasite that cause human infections are known to have animal reservoirs P knowlesi is known to regularly infect both humans and nonhuman primates Other nonhuman primate malarias particularly P cynomolgi and P simium have also been found to have spilled over into humans Nearly 200 Plasmodium species have been identified that infect birds reptiles and other mammals and about 30 of them naturally infect nonhuman primates Some malaria parasites of nonhuman primates NHP serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites such as P coatneyi a model for P falciparum and P cynomolgi a model for P vivax Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP are similar to those employed for humans Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research such as P berghei Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii the Galapagos and other archipelagoes The parasite P relictum is known to play a role in limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction References Sources Further reading External links WHO site on malaria Archived 20200502 at the Wayback Machine CDC site on malaria Archived 20211128 at the

    title: "Telemedicine",
    originalContent:
      "Telehealth is the distribution of healthrelated services and information via electronic information and telecommunication technologies It allows longdistance patient and clinician contact care advice reminders education intervention monitoring and remote admissions Telemedicine is sometimes used as a synonym or is used in a more limited sense to describe remote clinical services such as diagnosis and monitoring When rural settings lack of transport a lack of mobility conditions due to outbreaks epidemics or pandemics decreased funding or a lack of staff restrict access to care telehealth may bridge the gap as well as provide distancelearning meetings supervision and presentations between practitioners online information and health data management and healthcare system integration Telehealth could include two clinicians discussing a case over video conference a robotic surgery occurring through remote access physical therapy done via digital monitoring instruments live feed and application combinations tests being forwarded between facilities for interpretation by a higher specialist home monitoring through continuous sending of patient health data client to practitioner online conference or even videophone interpretation during a consult Telehealth versus telemedicine Telehealth is sometimes discussed interchangeably with telemedicine the latter being more common than the former The Health Resources and Services Administration distinguishes telehealth from telemedicine in its scope defining telemedicine only as describing remote clinical services such as diagnosis and monitoring while telehealth includes preventative promotive and curative care delivery This includes the abovementioned nonclinical applications like administration and provider education The United States Department of Health and Human Services states that the term telehealth includes nonclinical services such as provider training administrative meetings and continuing medical education and that the term telemedicine means remote clinical services The World Health Organization uses telemedicine to describe all aspects of health care including preventive care The American Telemedicine Association uses the terms telemedicine and telehealth interchangeably although it acknowledges that telehealth is sometimes used more broadly for remote health not involving active clinical treatments eHealth is another related term used particularly in the UK and Europe as an umbrella term that includes telehealth electronic medical records and other components of health information technology Methods and modalities Telehealth requires good Internet access by participants usually in the form of a strong reliable broadband connection and broadband mobile communication technology of at least the fourth generation 4G or longterm evolution LTE standard to overcome issues with video stability and bandwidth restrictions As broadband infrastructure has improved telehealth usage has become more widely feasible Healthcare providers often begin telehealth with a needs assessment which assesses hardships which can be improved by telehealth such as travel time costs or time off work Collaborators such as technology companies can ease the transition Delivery can come within four distinct domains live video synchronous storeandforward asynchronous remote patient monitoring and mobile health Store and forward Storeandforward telemedicine involves acquiring medical data like medical images biosignals etc and then transmitting this data to a doctor or medical specialist at a convenient time for assessment offline It does not require the presence of both parties at the same time Dermatology cf teledermatology radiology and pathology are common specialties that are conducive to asynchronous telemedicine A properly structured medical record preferably in electronic form should be a component of this transfer The storeandforward process requires the clinician to rely on a history report and audiovideo information in lieu of a physical examination Remote monitoring Remote monitoring also known as selfmonitoring or testing enables medical professionals to monitor a patient remotely using various technological devices This method is primarily used for managing chronic diseases or specific conditions such as heart disease diabetes mellitus or asthma These services can provide comparable health outcomes to traditional inperson patient encounters supply greater satisfaction to patients and may be costeffective Examples include homebased nocturnal dialysis and improved joint management Realtime interactive Electronic consultations are possible through interactive telemedicine services which provide realtime interactions between patient and provider Videoconferencing has been used in a wide range of clinical disciplines and settings for various purposes including management diagnosis counseling and monitoring of patients Videotelephony Videotelephony comprises the technologies for the reception and transmission of audiovideo signals by users at different locations for communication between people in realtime At the dawn of the technology videotelephony also included image phones which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional POTStype telephone lines essentially the same as slow scan TV systems Currently videotelephony is particularly useful to the deaf and speechimpaired who can use them with sign language and also with a video relay service and well as to those with mobility issues or those who are located in distant places and are in need of telemedical or teleeducational services Categories Emergency care Common daily emergency telemedicine is performed by SAMU Regulator Physicians in France Spain Chile and Brazil Aircraft and maritime emergencies are also handled by SAMU centres in Paris Lisbon and Toulouse A recent study identified three major barriers to adoption of telemedicine in emergency and critical care units They include Regulatory challenges related to the difficulty and cost of obtaining licensure across multiple states malpractice protection and privileges at multiple facilities Financial barrier lack of acceptance and reimbursement by government payers and some commercial insurance carriers which places the investment burden squarely upon the hospital or healthcare system Cultural barriers occurring from the lack of desire or unwillingness of some physicians to adapt clinical paradigms for telemedicine applications Emergency Telehealth is also gaining acceptance in the United States There are several modalities currently being practiced that include but are not limited to TeleTriage TeleMSE and ePPE An example of telehealth in the field is when EMS arrives on scene of an incident and is able to take an EKG that is then sent directly to a physician at the hospital to be read Therefore allowing instant care and management Telenursing Telenursing refers to the use of telecommunications and information technology in order to provide nursing services in health care whenever a large physical distance exists between patient and nurse or between any number of nurses As a field it is part of telehealth and has many points of contacts with other medical and nonmedical applications such as telediagnosis teleconsultation telemonitoring etc Telenursing is achieving significant growth rates in many countries due to several factors the preoccupation in reducing the costs of health care an increase in the number of aging and chronically ill population and the increase in coverage of health care to distant rural small or sparsely populated regions Among its benefits telenursing may help solve increasing shortages of nurses to reduce distances and save travel time and to keep patients out of hospital A greater degree of job satisfaction has been registered among telenurses In Australia during January 2014 Melbourne tech startup Small World Social collaborated with the Australian Breastfeeding Association to create the first handsfree breastfeeding Google Glass application for new mothers The application named Google Glass Breastfeeding app trial allows mothers to nurse their baby while viewing instructions about common breastfeeding issues latching on posture etc or call a lactation consultant via a secure Google Hangout who can view the issue through the mothers Google Glass camera The trial was successfully concluded in Melbourne in April 2014 and 100 of participants were breastfeeding confidently Telepalliative care Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical caregiving approach aimed at optimizing quality of life and mitigating suffering among people with serious complex and often terminal illnesses In the past palliative care was a disease specific approach but today the World Health Organization WHO takes a broader approach suggesting that palliative care should be applied as early as possible to any chronic and fatal illness As in many aspects of healthcare telehealth is increasingly being used in palliative care and is often referred to as telepalliative care The types of technology applied in telepalliative care are typically telecommunication technologies such as video conferencing or messaging for followup or digital symptom assessments through digital questionnaires generating alerts to health care professionals Telepalliative care has been shown to be a feasible approach to deliver palliative care among patients caregivers and health care professionals Telepalliative care can provide an added support system that enable patients to remain at home through selfreporting of symptoms and tailoring care to specific patients Studies have shown that the use of telehealth in palliative care is mostly well received by patients and that telepalliative care may improve access to health care professionals at home and enhance feelings of security and safety among patients receiving palliative care Further telepalliative care may enable more efficient utilization of healthcare resources promotes collaboration between different levels of healthcare and makes healthcare professionals more responsive to changes in patients condition Challenging aspects of the use of telehealth in palliative care have also been described Generally palliative care is a diverse medical specialty involving interdisciplinary professionals from different professional traditions and cultures delivering care to a heterogenous cohort of patients with diverse diseases conditions and symptoms This makes it a challenge to develop telehealth that is suitable for all patients and in all contexts of palliative care Some of the barriers to telepalliative care relate to inflexible reporting of complex and fluctuating symptoms and circumstances using electronic questionnaires Further palliative care emphasizes a holistic approach that should address existential spiritual and mental distress related to serious illness However few studies have included the selfreporting of existential or spiritual concerns emotions and wellbeing Healthcare professionals may also be uncomfortable providing emotional or psychological care remotely Palliative care has been characterized as hightouch rather than hightech limiting the interest in applying technological advancements when developing interventions To optimize the advantages and minimize the challenges with the use of telehealth in homebased palliative care future research should include users in the design and development process Understanding the potential of telehealth to support therapeutic relationships between patients and health care professionals and being aware of the possible difficulties and tensions it may create are critical to its successful and acceptable use Telepharmacy Telepharmacy is the delivery of pharmaceutical care via telecommunications to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a pharmacist It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of telemedicine as implemented in the field of pharmacy Telepharmacy services include drug therapy monitoring patient counseling prior authorization and refill authorization for prescription drugs and monitoring of formulary compliance with the aid of teleconferencing or videoconferencing Remote dispensing of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals nursing homes or other medical care facilities This approach allows patients in remote or underserved areas to receive pharmacy services that would otherwise be unavailable to them enhancing access to care and ensuring continuity in medication management Health outcomes appear similar when pharmacy services are delivered by telepharmacy compared to traditional service delivery The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes such as providing education training and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely Telepsychiatry Teledentistry Teledentistry is the use of information technology and telecommunications for dental care consultation education and public awareness in the same manner as telehealth and telemedicine Teleaudiology Teleaudiology is the utilization of telehealth to provide audiological services and may include the full scope of audiological practice This term was first used by Gregg Givens in 1999 in reference to a system being developed at East Carolina University in North Carolina US Teleneurology Teleneurology describes the use of mobile technology to provide neurological care remotely including care for stroke movement disorders like Parkinsons disease seizure disorders eg epilepsy etc The use of teleneurology gives us the opportunity to improve health care access for billions around the globe from those living in urban locations to those in remote rural locations Evidence shows that individuals with Parkinsons disease prefer personal connection with a remote specialist to their local clinician Such home care is convenient but requires access to and familiarity with internet A 2017 randomized controlled trial of virtual house calls or video visits with individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease evidences patient preference for the remote specialist vs their local clinician after one year Teleneurology for patients with Parkisons disease is found to be cheaper than in person visits by reducing transportation and travel time A recent systematic review by Ray Dorsey et al describes both the limitations and potential benefits of teleneurology to improve care for patients with chronic neurological conditions especially in lowincome countries White well educated and technologically savvy people are the biggest consumers of telehealth services for Parkinsons disease as compared to ethnic minorities in the US Teleneurosurgery Telemedicine in neurosurgery was historically primarily used for followup visits by patients that had to travel far to undergo surgery In the last decade telemedicine was also used for remote ICU rounding as well as prompt evaluation for acute ischemic stroke and administration of IV alteplase in conjunction with Neurology From the onset of the COVID19 pandemic there was a rapid surge in the use of telemedicine across all divisions of neurosurgery vascular oncology spine and functional neurosurgery Not only for followup visits but it has gained popularity for seeing new patients or following established patients regardless of whether they underwent surgery Telemedicine is not limited to direct patient care only there are a number of new research groups and companies focused on using telemedicine for clinical trials involving patients with neurosurgical diagnoses Teleneuropsychology Teleneuropsychology is the use of telehealthvideoconference technology for the remote administration of neuropsychological tests Neuropsychological tests are used to evaluate the cognitive status of individuals with known or suspected brain disorders and provide a profile of cognitive strengths and weaknesses Through a series of studies there is growing support in the literature showing that remote videoconferencebased administration of many standard neuropsychological tests results in test findings that are similar to traditional inperson evaluations thereby establishing the basis for the reliability and validity of teleneuropsychological assessment Telenutrition Telenutrition refers to the use of video conferencing telephony to provide online consultation by a nutritionist or dietician Patient or clients upload their vital statistics diet logs food pictures etc on a telenutrition portal which are then used by nutritionist or dietician to analyze their current health condition Nutritionist or dietician can then set goals for their respective client patients and monitor their progress regularly by followup consultations Telenutrition portals can help people seek remote consultation for themselves andor their family This can be extremely helpful for elderly or bed ridden patients who can consult their dietician from comfort of their homes Telenutrition showed to be feasible and the majority of patients trusted the nutritional televisits in place of the scheduled but not provided followup visits during the lockdown of the COVID19 pandemic Telerehabilitation Telerehabilitation or erehabilitation is the delivery of rehabilitation services over telecommunication networks and the Internet Most types of services fall into two categories clinical assessment the patients functional abilities in his or her environment and clinical therapy Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are neuropsychology speechlanguage pathology audiology occupational therapy and physical therapy Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a clinic because the patient has a disability or because of travel time Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance Most telerehabilitation is highly visual As of 2014 the most commonly used mediums are webcams videoconferencing phone lines videophones and webpages containing rich web applications The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided It is most widely used for neuropsychological rehabilitation fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as wheelchairs braces or artificial limbs and in speechlanguage pathology Rich web applications for neuropsychological rehabilitation aka cognitive rehabilitation of cognitive impairment from many etiologies were first introduced in 2001 This endeavor has expanded as a teletherapy application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children Teleaudiology hearing assessments is a growing application Physical therapy and psychology interventions delivered via telehealth may result in similar outcomes as those delivered inperson for a range of health conditions Two important areas of telerehabilitation research are 1 demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to inperson assessment and therapy and 2 building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice Groundbreaking research in telehaptics the sense of touch and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice in the future In the United States the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Researchs NIDRR supports research and the development of telerehabilitation NIDRRs grantees include the Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center RERC at the University of Pittsburgh the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago the State University of New York at Buffalo and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC Other federal funders of research are the Veterans Health Administration the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense Outside the United States excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe Only a few health insurers in the United States and about half of Medicaid programs reimburse for telerehabilitation services If the research shows that teleassessments and teletherapy are equivalent to clinical encounters it is more likely that insurers and Medicare will cover telerehabilitation services In India the Indian Association of Chartered Physiotherapists IACP provides telerehabilitation facilities With the support and collaboration of local clinics and private practitioners and the Members IACP IACP runs the facility named Telemedicine IACP has maintained an internetbased list of their members on their website through which patients can make online appointments Teletrauma care Telemedicine can be utilized to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of care in a trauma environment Examples include Telemedicine for trauma triage using telemedicine trauma specialists can interact with personnel on the scene of a mass casualty or disaster situation via the internet using mobile devices to determine the severity of injuries They can provide clinical assessments and determine whether those injured must be evacuated for necessary care Remote trauma specialists can provide the same quality of clinical assessment and plan of care as a trauma specialist located physically with the patient Telemedicine for intensive care unit ICU rounds Telemedicine is also being used in some trauma ICUs to reduce the spread of infections Rounds are usually conducted at hospitals across the country by a team of approximately ten or more people to include attending physicians fellows residents and other clinicians This group usually moves from bed to bed in a unit discussing each patient This aids in the transition of care for patients from the night shift to the morning shift but also serves as an educational experience for new residents to the team A new approach features the team conducting rounds from a conference room using a videoconferencing system The trauma attending residents fellows nurses nurse practitioners and pharmacists are able to watch a live video stream from the patients bedside They can see the vital signs on the monitor view the settings on the respiratory ventilator andor view the patients wounds Videoconferencing allows the remote viewers twoway communication with clinicians at the bedside Telemedicine for trauma education some trauma centers are delivering trauma education lectures to hospitals and health care providers worldwide using video conferencing technology Each lecture provides fundamental principles firsthand knowledge and evidencedbased methods for critical analysis of established clinical practice standards and comparisons to newer advanced alternatives The various sites collaborate and share their perspective based on location available staff and available resources Telemedicine in the trauma operating room trauma surgeons are able to observe and consult on cases from a remote location using video conferencing This capability allows the attending to view the residents in real time The remote surgeon has the capability to control the camera pan tilt and zoom to get the best angle of the procedure while at the same time providing expertise in order to provide the best possible care to the patient Telecardiology ECGs or electrocardiographs can be transmitted using telephone and wireless Willem Einthoven the inventor of the ECG actually did tests with transmission of ECG via telephone lines This was because the hospital did not allow him to move patients outside the hospital to his laboratory for testing of his new device In 1906 Einthoven came up with a way to transmit the data from the hospital directly to his lab Transmission of ECGs One of the oldest known telecardiology systems for teletransmissions of ECGs was established in Gwalior India in 1975 at GR Medical college by Ajai Shanker S Makhija PK Mantri using an indigenous technique for the first time in India This system enabled wireless transmission of ECG from the moving ICU van or the patients home to the central station in ICU of the department of Medicine Transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise Transmission was also done through telephone lines The ECG output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ECG into high frequency sound At the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ECG with a good gain accuracy The ECG was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500 Hz to 2500 Hz with 1500 Hz at baseline This system was also used to monitor patients with pacemakers in remote areas The central control unit at the ICU was able to correctly interpret arrhythmia This technique helped medical aid reach in remote areas In addition electronic stethoscopes can be used as recording devices which is helpful for purposes of telecardiology There are many examples of successful telecardiology services worldwide In Pakistan three pilot projects in telemedicine were initiated by the Ministry of IT Telecom Government of Pakistan MoIT through the Electronic Government Directorate in collaboration with Oratier Technologies a pioneer company within Pakistan dealing with healthcare and HMIS and PakDataCom a bandwidth provider Three hub stations through were linked via the Pak SatI communications satellite and four districts were linked with another hub A 312 Kb link was also established with remote sites and 1 Mbits bandwidth was provided at each hub Three hubs were established the Mayo Hospital the largest hospital in Asia JPMC Karachi and Holy Family Rawalpindi These 12 remote sites were connected and on average of 1500 patients were treated per month per hub The project was still running smoothly after two years Wireless ambulatory ECG technology moving beyond previous ambulatory ECG technology such as the Holter monitor now includes smartphones and Apple Watches which can perform athome cardiac monitoring and send the data to a physician via the internet Teleradiology Teleradiology is the ability to send radiographic images xrays CT MR PETCT SPECTCT MG US from one location to another For this process to be implemented three essential components are required an image sending station a transmission network and a receivingimage review station The most typical implementation are two computers connected via the Internet The computer at the receiving end will need to have a highquality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes Sometimes the receiving computer will have a printer so that images can be printed for convenience The teleradiology process begins at the image sending station The radiographic image and a modem or other connection are required for this first step The image is scanned and then sent via the network connection to the receiving computer Todays highspeed broadband based Internet enables the use of new technologies for teleradiology the image reviewer can now have access to distant servers in order to view an exam Therefore they do not need particular workstations to view the images a standard personal computer PC and digital subscriber line DSL connection is enough to reach Keosys central server No particular software is necessary on the PC and the images can be reached from anywhere in the world Teleradiology is the most popular use for telemedicine and accounts for at least 50 of all telemedicine usage Telepathology Telepathology is the practice of pathology at a distance It uses telecommunications technology to facilitate the transfer of imagerich pathology data between distant locations for the purposes of diagnosis education and research Performance of telepathology requires that a pathologist selects the video images for analysis and the rendering diagnoses The use of television microscopy the forerunner of telepathology did not require that a pathologist have physical or virtual handson involvement is the selection of microscopic fieldsofview for analysis and diagnosis A pathologist Ronald S Weinstein MD coined the term telepathology in 1986 In an editorial in a medical journal Weinstein outlined the actions that would be needed to create remote pathology diagnostic services He and his collaborators published the first scientific paper on robotic telepathology Weinstein was also granted the first US patents for robotic telepathology systems and telepathology diagnostic networks Weinstein is known to many as the father of telepathology In Norway Eide and Nordrum implemented the first sustainable clinical telepathology service in 1989 This is still in operation decades later A number of clinical telepathology services have benefited many thousands of patients in North America Europe and Asia Telepathology has been successfully used for many applications including the rendering histopathology tissue diagnoses at a distance for education and for research Although digital pathology imaging including virtual microscopy is the mode of choice for telepathology services in developed countries analog telepathology imaging is still used for patient services in some developing countries Teledermatology Teledermatology allows dermatology consultations over a distance using audio visual and data communication and has been found to improve efficiency access to specialty care and patient satisfaction Applications comprise health care management such as diagnoses consultation and treatment as well as continuing medical education The dermatologists Perednia and Brown were the first to coin the term teledermatology in 1995 where they described the value of a teledermatologic service in a rural area underserved by dermatologists Teleophthalmology Teleophthalmology is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care through digital medical equipment and telecommunications technology Today applications of teleophthalmology encompass access to eye specialists for patients in remote areas ophthalmic disease screening diagnosis and monitoring as well as distant learning Teleophthalmology may help reduce disparities by providing remote lowcost screening tests such as diabetic retinopathy screening to lowincome and uninsured patients In Mizoram India a hilly area with poor roads between 2011 and 2015 teleophthalmology provided care to over 10000 patients These patients were examined by ophthalmic assistants locally but surgery was done on appointment after the patient images were viewed online by eye surgeons in the hospital 612 hours away Instead of an average five trips for say a cataract procedure only one was required for surgery alone as even postop care like removal of stitches and appointments for glasses was done locally There were large cost savings in travel as well In the United States some companies allow patients to complete an online visual exam and within 24 hours receive a prescription from an optometrist valid for eyeglasses contact lenses or both Some US states such as Indiana have attempted to ban these companies from doing business Telesurgery Remote surgery also known as telesurgery is the ability for a doctor to perform surgery on a patient even though they are not physically in the same location It is a form of telepresence Remote surgery combines elements of robotics cuttingedge telecommunications such as highspeed data connections telehaptics and elements of management information systems While the field of robotic surgery is fairly well established most of these robots are controlled by surgeons at the location of the surgery Remote surgery is remote work for surgeons where the physical distance between the surgeon and the patient is immaterial It promises to allow the expertise of specialized surgeons to be available to patients worldwide without the need for patients to travel beyond their local hospital Remote surgery or telesurgery is performance of surgical procedures where the surgeon is not physically in the same location as the patient using a robotic teleoperator system controlled by the surgeon The remote operator may give tactile feedback to the user Remote surgery combines elements of robotics and highspeed data connections A critical limiting factor is the speed latency and reliability of the communication system between the surgeon and the patient though transAtlantic surgeries have been demonstrated Teleabortion Telemedicine has been used globally to increase access to abortion care specifically medical abortion in environments where few abortion care providers exist or abortion is legally restricted Clinicians are able to virtually provide counseling review screening tests observe the administration of an abortion medication and directly mail abortion pills to people In 2004 Women on Web WoW Amsterdam started offering online consultations mostly to people living in areas where abortion was legally restricted informing them how to safely use medical abortion drugs to end a pregnancy People contact the Women on Web service online physicians review any necessary lab results or ultrasounds mail mifepristone and misoprostol pills to people then follow up through online communication In the United States medical abortion was introduced as a telehealth service in Iowa by Planned Parenthood of the Heartland in 2008 to allow a patient at one health facility to communicate via secure video with a health provider at another facility In this model a person seeking abortion care must come to a health facility An abortion care provider communicates with the person located at another site using clinictoclinic videoconferencing to provide medical abortion after screening tests and consultation with clinic staff In 2018 the website Aid Access was launched by the founder of Women on Web Rebecca Gomperts It offers a similar service as Women on Web in the United States but the medications are prescribed to an Indian pharmacy then mailed to the United States The TelAbortion study conducted by Gynuity Health Projects with special approval from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA aims to increase access to medical abortion care without requiring an inperson visit to a clinic This models was expanded during the COVID19 pandemic and as of March 2020 exists in 13 US states and has enrolled over 730 people in the study The person receives counseling and instruction from an abortion care provider via videoconference from a location of their choice The medications necessary for the abortion mifepristone and misoprostol are mailed directly to the person and they have a followup video consultation in 714 days A systematic review of telemedicine abortion has found the practice to be safe effective efficient and satisfactory In the United States eighteen states require the clinician to be physically present during the administration of medications for abortion which effectively bans telehealth of medication abortion five states explicitly ban telemedicine for medication abortion while thirteen states require the prescriber usually required to be a physician to be physically present with the patient In the UK the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists approved a notest protocol for medication abortion with mifepristone available through a minimalcontact pickup or by mail Other specialist care delivery Telemedicine can facilitate specialty care delivered by primary care physicians according to a controlled study of the treatment of hepatitis C Various specialties are contributing to telemedicine in varying degreesOther specialist conditions for which telemedicine has been used include perinatal mental health In light of the COVID19 pandemic primary care physicians have relied on telehealth to continue to provide care in outpatient settings The transition to virtual health has been beneficial in providing patients access to care especially care that does not require a physical exam eg medication changes minor health updates and avoid putting patients at risk of COVID19 This included providing services to pediatric patients during the pandemic where issues of last minute cancelation and rescheduling were frequently related to a lack of technicality and engagement two factors often understudied in the literature Telemedicine has also been beneficial in facilitating medical education to students while still allowing for adequate social distancing during the COVID19 pandemic Many medical schools have shifted to alternate forms of virtual curriculum and are still able to engage in meaningful telehealth encounters with patients Medication assisted treatment MAT is the treatment of opioid use disorder OUD with medications often in combination with behavioral therapy As a response to the COVID19 pandemic the use of telemedicine has been granted by the Drug Enforcement Administration to start or maintain people OUD on buprenorphine trade name Suboxone via telemedicine without the need for an initial inperson examination On March 31 2020 QuickMD became the first national TeleMAT service in the United States to provide Medicationassisted Treatment with Suboxone online without the need of an inperson visit with others announcing to follow soon Major developments In policy Telehealth is a modern form of health care delivery Telehealth breaks away from traditional health care delivery by using modern telecommunication systems including wireless communication methods Traditional health is legislated through policy to ensure the safety of medical practitioners and patients Consequently since telehealth is a new form of health care delivery that is now gathering momentum in the health sector many organizations have started to legislate the use of telehealth into policy In New Zealand the Medical Council has a statement about telehealth on their website This illustrates that the medical council has foreseen the importance that telehealth will have on the health system and have started to introduce telehealth legislation to practitioners along with government Transition to mainstream Traditional use of telehealth services has been for specialist treatment However there has been a paradigm shift and telehealth is no longer considered a specialist service This development has ensured that many access barriers are eliminated as medical professionals and patients are able to use wireless communication technologies to deliver health care This is evident in rural communities Rural residents typically have to travel to longer distances to access healthcare than urban counterparts due to physician shortages and healthcare facility closures in these areas Telehealth eliminates this barrier as health professionals are able to conduct medical consultations through the use of wireless communication technologies However this process is dependent on both parties having internet access and comfort level with technology which poses barriers for many lowincome and rural communities Telehealth allows the patient to be monitored between physician office visits which can improve patient health Telehealth also allows patients to access expertise which is not available in their local area This remote patient monitoring ability enables patients to stay at home longer and helps avoid unnecessary hospital time In the longterm this could potentially result in less burdening of the healthcare system and consumption of resources During the COVID19 pandemic there were large increases in the use of telemedicine for primary care visits within the United States increasing from an average of 14 million visits in Q2 of 2018 and 2019 to 35 million visits in Q2 2020 according to data from IQVIA The telehealth market is expected to grow at 40 a year in 2021 Use of telemedicine by General Practitioners in the UK rose from 20 to 30 preCOVID to almost 80 by the beginning of 2021 More than 70 of practitioners and patients were satisfied with this Boris Johnson was said to have piled pressure on GPs to offer more inperson consultations supporting a campaign largely orchestrated by the Daily Mail The Royal College of General Practitioners said that a patient right to have facetoface appointments if they wished was undeliverable Technology advancement The technological advancement of wireless communication devices is a major development in telehealth This allows patients to selfmonitor their health conditions and to not rely as much on health care professionals Furthermore patients are more willing to stay on their treatment plans as they are more invested and included in the process as the decisionmaking is shared Technological advancement also means that health care professionals are able to use better technologies to treat patients for example in maternal care and surgery A 2023 study published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons showed telemedicine as making a positive impact with expectations exceeded for those physicians and patients who had consulted online for surgeries Technological developments in telehealth are essential to improve health care especially the delivery of healthcare services as resources are finite along with an ageing population that is living longer Licensing US licensing and regulatory issues Restrictive licensure laws in the United States require a practitioner to obtain a full license to deliver telemedicine care across state lines Typically states with restrictive licensure laws also have several exceptions varying from state to state that may release an outofstate practitioner from the additional burden of obtaining such a license A number of states require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license If a practitioner serves several states obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and timeconsuming proposition Even if the practitioner never practices medicine facetoface with a patient in another state heshe still must meet a variety of other individual state requirements including paying substantial licensure fees passing additional oral and written examinations and traveling for interviews In 2008 the US passed the Ryan Haight Act which required facetoface or valid telemedicine consultations prior to receiving a prescription State medical licensing boards have sometimes opposed telemedicine for example in 2012 electronic consultations were illegal in Idaho and an Idaholicensed general practitioner was punished by the board for prescribing an antibiotic triggering reviews of her licensure and board certifications across the country Subsequently in 2015 the state legislature legalized electronic consultations In 2015 Teladoc filed suit against the Texas Medical Board over a rule that required inperson consultations initially the judge refused to dismiss the case noting that antitrust laws apply to state medical boards Major implications and impacts Telehealth allows multiple varying disciplines to merge and deliver a potentially more uniform level of care using technology As telehealth proliferates mainstream healthcare it challenges notions of traditional healthcare delivery Some populations experience better quality access and more personalized health care Health promotion Telehealth can also increase health promotion efforts These efforts can now be more personalised to the target population and professionals can extend their help into homes or private and safe environments in which patients of individuals can practice ask and gain health information Health promotion using telehealth has become increasingly popular in underdeveloped countries where there are very poor physical resources available There has been a particular push toward mHealth applications as many areas even underdeveloped ones have mobile phone and smartphone coverage In a 2015 article reviewing research on the use of a mobile health application in the United Kingdom authors describe how a homebased application helped patients manage and monitor their health and symptoms independently The mobile health application allows people to rapidly selfreport their symptoms 95 of patients were able to report their daily symptoms in less than 100 seconds which is less than the 5 minutes plus commuting taken to measure vital signs by nurses in hospitals Online applications allow patients to remain at home to keep track of the progression of their chronic illnesses The downside of using mHealth applications is that not everyone especially in developing countries has daily access to internet or electronic devices In developed countries health promotion efforts using telehealth have been met with some success The Australian handsfree breastfeeding Google Glass application reported promising results in 2014 This application made in collaboration with the Australian Breastfeeding Association and a tech startup called Small World Social helped new mothers learn how to breastfeed Breastfeeding is beneficial to infant health and maternal health and is recommended by the World Health Organisation and health organisations all over the world Widespread breastfeeding can prevent 820000 infant deaths globally but the practice is often stopped prematurely or intents to do are disrupted due to lack of social support knowhow or other factors This application gave mothers handsfree information on breastfeeding instructions on how to breastfeed and also had an option to call a lactation consultant over Google Hangout When the trial ended all participants were reported to be confident in breastfeeding Health care quality and barriers to adoption A scientific review indicates that in general outcomes of telemedicine are or can be as good as inperson care with health care use staying similar Advantages of the nonexclusive adoption of already existing telemedicine technologies such as smartphone videotelephony may include reduced infection risks increased control of disease during epidemic conditions improved access to care reduced stress and exposure to other pathogens during illness for better recovery reduced time and labor costs efficient more accessible matching of patients with particular symptoms and clinicians who are experts for such and reduced travel while disadvantages may include privacy breaches eg due to software backdoors and vulnerabilities or sale of data dependability on Internet access and depending on various factors increased health care use Theoretically the whole health system could benefit from telehealth There are indications telehealth consumes fewer resources and requires fewer people to operate it with shorter training periods to implement initiatives Commenters suggested that lawmakers may fear that making telehealth widely accessible without any other measures would lead to patients using unnecessary health care services Telemedicine could also be used for connected networks between health care professionals Telemedicine also can eliminate the possible transmission of infectious diseases or parasites between patients and medical staff This is particularly an issue where MRSA is a concern Additionally some patients who feel uncomfortable in a doctors office may do better remotely For example white coat syndrome may be avoided Patients who are homebound and would otherwise require an ambulance to move them to a clinic are also a consideration However whether or not the standard of health care quality is increasing is debatable with some literature refuting such claims Research has reported that clinicians find the process difficult and complex to deal with Furthermore there are concerns around informed consent legality issues as well as legislative issues A recent study also highlighted that the swift and largescale implementation of telehealth across the United Kingdom NHS Allied Health Professional AHP services might increase disparities in health care access for vulnerable populations with limited digital literacy Although health care may become affordable with the help of technology whether or not this care will be good is the issue Many studies indicate high satisfaction with telemedicine among patients Among the factors associated with a good trust in telemedicine the use of known and userfriendly video services and confidence in the data protection policies were the two variables contributing most to trust in telemedicine Major problems with increasing adoption include technically challenged staff resistance to change or habits and age of patient Focused policy could eliminate several barriers A review lists a number of potentially good practices and pitfalls recommending the use of virtual handshakes for confirming identity taking consent for conducting remote consultation over a conventional meeting and professional standardized norms for protecting patient privacy and confidentiality It also found that the COVID19 pandemic substantially increased voluntarily the adoption of telephone or video consultation and suggests that telemedicine technology is a key factor in delivery of health care in the future Economic evaluations Due to its digital nature it is often assumed that telehealth saves the health system money However the evidence to support this is varied When conducting economic evaluations of telehealth services the individuals evaluating them need to be aware of potential outcomes and extraclinical benefits of the telehealth service Economic viability relies on the funding model within the country being examined public vs private the consumers willingnesstopay and the expected remuneration by the clinicians or commercial entities providing the services examples of research on these topics from teledermoscopy in Australia In a UK telehealth trial done in 2011 it was reported that the cost of health could be dramatically reduced with the use of telehealth monitoring The usual cost of in vitro fertilisation IVF per cycle would be around 15000 with telehealth it was reduced to 800 per patient In Alaska the Federal Health Care Access Network which connects 3000 healthcare providers to communities engaged in 160000 telehealth consultations from 2001 and saved the state 85 million in travel costs for just Medicaid patients Digital interventions for mental health conditions seem to be costeffective compared to no intervention or nontherapeutic responses such as monitoring However when compared to inperson therapy or medication their added value is currently uncertain Beneficial enablements Telemedicine can be beneficial to patients in isolated communities and remote regions who can receive care from doctors or specialists far away without the patient having to travel to visit them Recent developments in mobile collaboration technology can allow healthcare professionals in multiple locations to share information and discuss patient issues as if they were in the same place Remote patient monitoring through mobile technology can reduce the need for outpatient visits and enable remote prescription verification and drug administration oversight potentially significantly reducing the overall cost of medical care It may also be preferable for patients with limited mobility for example patients with Parkinsons disease Telemedicine can also facilitate medical education by allowing workers to observe experts in their fields and share best practices more easily During war and disasters Remote surgery and types of videoconferencing for sharing expertise eg ad hoc assistance have been and could be used to support doctors in Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Nonclinical uses Distance education including continuing medical education grand rounds and patient education administrative uses including meetings among telehealth networks supervision and presentations research on telehealth online information and health data management healthcare system integration asset identification listing and patient to asset matching and movement overall healthcare system management patient movement and remote admission Physical distancing to prevent transmission of communicable diseases Limitations and restrictions While many branches of medicine have wanted to fully embrace telehealth for a long time there are certain risks and barriers which bar the full amalgamation of telehealth into best practice For a start it is dubious as to whether a practitioner can fully leave the handson experience behind Although it is predicted that telehealth will replace many consultations and other health interactions it cannot yet fully replace a physical examination this is particularly so in diagnostics rehabilitation or mental health To minimise safety issues researchers have suggested not offering remote consultations for some conditions breathing problems new psychosis or acute chest pain for example when a parent is very concerned about a child when a condition has not resolved as expected or has worsened or to people who might struggle to understand or be understood such as those with limited English or learning difficulties The benefits posed by telehealth challenge the normative means of healthcare delivery set in both legislation and practice Therefore the growing prominence of telehealth is starting to underscore the need for updated regulations guidelines and legislation which reflect the current and future trends of healthcare practices Telehealth enables timely and flexible care to patients wherever they may be although this is a benefit it also poses threats to privacy safety medical licensing and reimbursement When a clinician and patient are in different locations it is difficult to determine which laws apply to the context Once healthcare crosses borders different state bodies are involved in order to regulate and maintain the level of care that is warranted to the patient or telehealth consumer As it stands telehealth is complex with many grey areas when put into practice especially as it crosses borders This effectively limits the potential benefits of telehealth An example of these limitations include the current American reimbursement infrastructure where Medicare will reimburse for telehealth services only when a patient is living in an area where specialists are in shortage or in particular rural counties The area is defined by whether it is a medical facility as opposed to a patients home The site that the practitioner is in however is unrestricted Medicare will only reimburse live video synchronous type services not storeandforward mhealth or remote patient monitoring if it does not involve livevideo Some insurers currently will reimburse telehealth but not all yet So providers and patients must go to the extra effort of finding the correct insurers before continuing Again in America states generally tend to require that clinicians are licensed to practice in the surgery state therefore they can only provide their service if licensed in an area that they do not live in themselves More specific and widely reaching laws legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology They will have to be fully agreed upon for example will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too or could there be a limited use telehealth licence Would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions or only some Who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times Which state city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred A major legal action prompt in telehealth thus far has been issues surrounding online prescribing and whether an appropriate clinicianpatient relationship can be established online to make prescribing safe making this an area that requires particular scrutiny It may be required that the practitioner and patient involved must meet in person at least once before online prescribing can occur or that at least a livevideo conference must occur not just impersonal questionnaires or surveys to determine need Telehealth has some potential for facilitating selfmanagement techniques in health care but for patients to benefit from it the appropriate contact with and relationship between doctor and patient must be established first This would start with an online consultation providing patients with techniques and tools that help them participate in healthy behaviors and initiating a collaborative partnership between health care professionals and patient Selfmanagement strategies fall into a broader category called patient activation which is defined as a patients willingness and ability to take independent actions to manage their health It can be achieved by increasing patients knowledge and confidence in coping with and managing their own disease through a regular assessment of progress and problemsolving support Teaching patients about their conditions and ways to cope with chronic illnesses will allow them to be knowledgeable about their disease and willing to manage it improving their everyday life Without a focus on the doctorpatient relationship and on the patients understanding telehealth cannot improve the quality of life of patients despite the benefit of allowing them to do their medical checkups from the comfort of their home The downsides of telemedicine include the cost of telecommunication and data management equipment and of technical training for medical personnel who will employ it Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional and an increased risk that protected health information may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually decrease time efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions for example it has been estimated that a teledermatology consultation can take up to thirty minutes whereas fifteen minutes is typical for a traditional consultation Additionally potentially poor quality of transmitted records such as images or patient progress reports and decreased access to relevant clinical information are quality assurance risks that can compromise the quality and continuity of patient care for the reporting doctor Other obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine include unclear legal regulation for some telemedical practices and difficulty claiming reimbursement from insurers or government programs in some fields Some medical organizations have delivered position statement on the correct use of telemedicine in their field Another disadvantage of telemedicine is the inability to start treatment immediately For example a patient with a bacterial infection might be given an antibiotic hypodermic injection in the clinic and observed for any reaction before that antibiotic is prescribed in pill form Equitability is also a concern Many families and individuals in the United States and other countries do not have internet access in their homes or the proper electronic devices to access services such as a laptop or smartphone Ethical issues Informed consent is another issue should the patient give informed consent to receive online care before it starts Or will it be implied if it is care that can only practically be given over distance When telehealth includes the possibility for technical problems such as transmission errors security breaches or storage issues it can impact the systems ability to communicate It may be wise to obtain informed consent in person first as well as having backup options for when technical issues occur In person a patient can see who is involved in their care namely themselves and their clinician in a consult but online there will be other involved such as the technology providers therefore consent may need to involve disclosure of anyone involved in the transmission of the information and the security that will keep their information private and any legal malpractice cases may need to involve all of those involved as opposed to what would usually just be the practitioner State of the market The rate of adoption of telehealth services in any jurisdiction is frequently influenced by factors such as the adequacy and cost of existing conventional health services in meeting patient needs the policies of governments andor insurers with respect to coverage and payment for telehealth services and medical licensing requirements that may inhibit or deter the provision of telehealth second opinions or primary consultations by physicians Projections for the growth of the telehealth market are optimistic and much of this optimism is predicated upon the increasing demand for remote medical care According to a recent survey nearly threequarters of US consumers say they would use telehealth At present several major companies along with a bevvy of startups are working to develop a leading presence in the field In the UK the Governments Care Services minister Paul Burstow has stated that telehealth and telecare would be extended over the next five years 20122017 to reach three million people United States In the United States telemedicine companies are collaborating with health insurers and other telemedicine providers to expand marketshare and patient access to telemedicine consultations As of 2019 95 of employers believe their organizations will continue to provide health care benefits over the next five years The COVID19 pandemic drove increased usage of telehealth services in the US The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 154 increase in telehealth visits during the last week of March 2020 compared to the same dates in 2019 Switzerland From 1999 to 2018 the University Hospital of Zurich USZ offered clinical telemedicine and online medical advice on the Internet A team of doctors answered around 2500 anonymous inquiries annually usually within 24 to 48 hours The team consisted of up to six physicians who are specialists in clinical telemedicine at the USZ and have many years of experience particularly in internal and general medicine In the entire period 59360 inquiries were sent and answered The majority of the users were female and on average 38 years old However in the course of time considerably more men and older people began to use the service The diversity of medical queries covered all categories of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD and correlated with the statistical frequency of diseases in hospitals in Switzerland Most of the inquiries concerned unclassified symptoms and signs services related to reproduction respiratory diseases skin diseases health services diseases of the eye and nervous systems injuries and disorders of the female genital tract As with the Swedish online medical advice service onesixth of the requests related to often shameful and stigmatised diseases of the genitals gastrointestinal tract sexually transmitted infections obesity and mental disorders By providing an anonymous space where users can talk about shameful diseases online telemedical services empower patients and their health literacy is enhanced by providing individualized health information The Clinical Telemedicine and Online Counselling service of the University Hospital of Zurich is currently being revised and will be offered in a new form in the future Developing countries For developing countries telemedicine and eHealth can be the only means of healthcare provision in remote areas For example the difficult financial situation in many African states and lack of trained health professionals has meant that the majority of the people in subSaharan Africa are badly disadvantaged in medical care and in remote areas with low population density direct healthcare provision is often very poor However provision of telemedicine and eHealth from urban centers or from other countries is hampered by the lack of communications infrastructure with no landline phone or broadband internet connection little or no mobile connectivity and often not even a reliable electricity supply Telemedicine in developing countries Telemedicine in India India has broad ruralurban population and rural India is bereaved from medical facilities giving telemedicine a space for growth in India Deprived education and medical professionals in rural areas is the reason behind governments ideology to use technology to bridge this gap Remote areas not only present a number of challenges for the service providers but also for the families who are accessing these services Since 2018 telemedicine has expanded in India It has undertaken a new way for doctor consultations On 25 March 2020 in the wake of COVID19 pandemic the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued Indias Telemedicine Practice Guidelines The Board of Governors entasked by the Health Ministry published an amendment to the Indian Medical Council Professional Conduct Etiquette and Ethics Regulations 2002 that gave muchneeded statutory support for the practice of telemedicine in India This sector is at an evergrowing stage with high scope of development In April 2020 the union health ministry launched the eSanjeevani telemedicine service that operates at two levels the doctortodoctor telemedicine platform and the doctortopatient platform This service crossed five million teleconsultations within a year of its launch indicating conducive environment for acceptability and growth of telemedicine in India Telemedicine in SubSaharan Africa SubSaharan Africa is marked by the massive introduction of new technologies and internet access Urban areas are facing a rapid change and development and access to internet and health is rapidly improving Population in remote areas however still lack access to healthcare and modern technologies Some people in rural regions must travel more between 2 and 6 hours to reach the closest healthcare facilities of their country leaving room for telehealth to grow and reach isolated people in the near future Internet via satellite in rural areas The Satellite African eHEalth vaLidation SAHEL demonstration project has shown how satellite broadband technology can be used to establish telemedicine in such areas SAHEL was started in 2010 in Kenya and Senegal providing selfcontained solarpowered internet terminals to rural villages for use by community nurses for collaboration with distant health centers for training diagnosis and advice on local health issues Those methods can have major impact on both health professionals to get and provide training from remote areas and on the local population who can receive care without traveling long distances Some nonprofits provide internet to rural places around the world using a mobile VSAT terminal This VSAT terminal equips remote regions allowing them to alert the world when there is a medical emergency resulting in a rapid deployment or response from developed countries Technologies such as the ones used by MAF allows health professionals in remote clinics to have internet access making consultations much easier both for patients and doctors In 2014 the government of Luxembourg along with satellite operators and NGOs established SATMED a multilayer eHealth platform to improve public health in remote areas of emerging and developing countries using the Emergencylu disaster relief satellite platform and the Astra 2G TV satellite SATMED was first deployed in response to a report in 2014 by German Doctors of poor communications in Sierra Leone hampering the fight against Ebola and SATMED equipment arrived in the Serabu clinic in Sierra Leone in December 2014 In June 2015 SATMED was deployed at Maternit Hospital in Ahozonnoude Benin to provide remote consultation and monitoring and is the only effective communication link between Ahozonnoude the capital and a third hospital in Allada since land routes are often inaccessible due to flooding during the rainy season History The development and history of telehealth or telemedicine terms used interchangeably in literature is deeply rooted in the history and development in not only technology but also society itself Humans have long sought to relay important messages through torches optical telegraphy electroscopes and wireless transmission Early forms of telemedicine achieved with telephone and radio have been supplemented with videotelephony advanced diagnostic methods supported by distributed clientserver applications and additionally with telemedical devices to support inhome care In the 21st century with the advent of the internet portable devices and other such digital devices are taking a transformative role in healthcare and its delivery Earliest instances Although traditional medicine relies on inperson care the need and want for remote care has existed from the Roman and preHippocratic periods in antiquity The elderly and infirm who could not visit temples for medical care sent representatives to convey information on symptoms and bring home a diagnosis as well as treatment In Africa villagers would use smoke signals to warn neighboring villages of disease outbreak The beginnings of telehealth have existed through primitive forms of communication and technology The exact date of origin for Telehealth is unknown but it was known to have been used during the Bubonic Plague That version of telehealth was far different from how we know it today During that time they were communicating by heliograph and bonfire Those were used to notify other groups of people about famine and war Those are not using any form of technology yet but are starting to spread the idea of connectivity among groups of people who geographically could not be together 1800s to early 1900s As technology developed and wired communication became increasingly commonplace the ideas surrounding telehealth began emerging The earliest telehealth encounter can be traced to Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 when he used his early telephone as a means of getting help from his assistant Mr Watson after he spilt acid on his trousers Another instance of early telehealth specifically telemedicine was reported in The Lancet in 1879 An anonymous writer described a case where a doctor successfully diagnosed a child over the telephone in the middle of the night This Lancet issue also further discussed the potential of Remote Patient Care in order to avoid unnecessary house visits which were part of routine health care during the 1800s Other instances of telehealth during this period came from the American Civil War during which telegraphs were used to deliver casualtymortality lists medical care to soldiers and ordering further medical supplies As the 1900s started physicians quickly found a use for the telephone making it a prime communication channel to contact patients and other physicians Over the next fiftyplus years the telephone was a staple for medical communication As the 1930s came around radio communication played a key role especially during World War I It was specifically used to communicate with remote areas such as Alaska and Australia They used the radio to communicate medical information During the Vietnam War radio communication had become more advanced and was now used to send medical teams in helicopters to help This then brought together the Aerial Medical Service AMS who used telegraphs radios and planes to help care for people who lived in remote areas From the late 1800s to the early 1900s the early foundations of wireless communication were laid down Radios provided an easier and near instantaneous form of communication The use of radio to deliver healthcare became accepted for remote areas The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia is an example of the early adoption of radios in telehealth In 1925 the inventor Hugo Gernsback wrote an article for the magazine Science and Invention which included a prediction of a future where patients could be treated remotely by doctors through a device he called a teledactyl His descriptions of the device are similar to what would later become possible with new technology Mid1900s to 1980s When the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA began plans to send astronauts into space the need for telemedicine became clear In order to monitor their astronauts in space telemedicine capabilities were built into the spacecraft as well as the first spacesuits Additionally during this period telehealth and telemedicine were promoted in different countries especially the United States and Canada Carrier Sekani Family Services helped pioneer telehealth in British Columbia and Canada according to its CEO Warner Adam After the telegraph and telephone started to successfully help physicians treat patients from remote areas telehealth became more recognized Technological advancements occurred when NASA sent men to space Engineers for NASA created biomedical telemetry and telecommunications systems NASA technology monitored vitals such as blood pressure heart rate respiration rate and temperature After the technology was created it then became the base of telehealth medicine for the public Massachusetts General Hospital and Bostons Logan International Airport had a role in the early use of telemedicine which more or less coincided with NASAs foray into telemedicine through the use of physiologic monitors for astronauts On October 26 1960 a plane struck a flock of birds upon takeoff killing many passengers and leaving a number wounded Due to the extreme complexity of trying to get all the medical personnel out from the hospital the practical solution became telehealth This was expanded upon in 1967 when Kenneth Bird at Massachusetts General founded one of the first telemedicine clinics The clinic addressed the fundamental problem of delivering occupational and emergency health services to employees and travellers at the airport located three congested miles from the hospital Clinicians at the hospital would provide consultation services to patients who were at the airport Consultations were achieved through microwave audio as well as video links The airport began seeing over a hundred patients a day at its nurserun clinic that cared for victims of plane crashes and other accidents taking vital signs electrocardiograms and video images that were sent to Massachusetts General Over 1000 patients are documented as having received remote treatment from doctors at MGH using the clinics twoway audiovisual microwave circuit One notable story featured a woman who got off a flight in Boston and was experiencing chest pain They performed a workup at the airport took her to the telehealth suite where Raymond Murphy appeared on the television and had a conversation with her While this was happening another doctor took notes and the nurses took vitals and any test that Murphy ordered At this point telehealth was becoming more mainstream and was starting to become more technologically advanced which created a viable option for patients In 1964 the Nebraska Psychiatric Institute began using television links to form twoway communication with the Norfolk State Hospital which was 112 miles away for the education and consultation purposes between clinicians in the two locations In 1972 the Department of Health Education and Welfare in the United States approved funding for seven telemedicine projects across different states This funding was renewed and two further projects were funded the following year In March 1972 the San Bernardino County Medical Society officially implemented its TelMed program a system of prerecorded healthrelated messages with a log of 50 tapes The nonprofit initiative began in 1971 as a local medical project to ease the doctor shortage in the expanding San Bernardino Valley and improve the publics access to sound medical information It covered subjects ranging from cannabis to vaginitis In January 1973 in response to the developing London flu epidemic hitting California and the country a tape providing information on the disease was on air within a week after news broke of the flu spreading in the state That spring programs were implemented in San Diego and Indianapolis Indiana signaling a national acceptance of the concept By 1979 its system offered messages on over 300 different subjects 200 of which were available in Spanish as well as English and serviced over 65 million people in 180 cities around the country 1980s to 1990s maturation and renaissance Telehealth projects underway before and during the 1980s would take off but fail to enter mainstream healthcare As a result this period of telehealth history is called the maturation stage and made way for sustainable growth Although state funding in North America was beginning to run low different hospitals began to launch their own telehealth initiatives NASA provided an ATS3 satellite to enable medical care communications of American Red Cross and Pan American Health Organization response teams following the 1985 Mexico City earthquake The agency then launched its SateLifeHealthNet programme to increase health service connectivity in developing countries In 1997 NASA sponsored Yales Medical Informatics and Technology Applications Consortium project Florida first experimented with primitive telehealth in its prisons during the latter 1980s Working with Doctors Oscar W Boultinghouse and Michael J Davis from the early 1990s to 2007 Glenn G Hammack led the University of Texas Medical Branch UTMB development of a pioneering telehealth program in Texas state prisons The three UTMB alumni would in 2007 cofound telehealth provider NuPhysician The first interactive telemedicine system operating over standard telephone lines designed to remotely diagnose and treat patients requiring cardiac resuscitation defibrillation was developed and launched by an American company MedPhone Corporation in 1989 A year later under the leadership of its PresidentCEO S Eric Wachtel MedPhone introduced a mobile cellular version the MDPhone Twelve hospitals in the US served as receiving and treatment centers Athome virtual care As the expansion of telehealth continued in 1990 Maritime Health Services MHS was a big part of the initiation for occupational health services They sent a medical officer aboard the Pacific trawler that allowed for roundtheclock communication with a physician The system that allows for this is called the Medical Consultation Network MedNet MedNet is a video chatting system that has live audio and visual so the physician on the other end of the call can see and hear what is happening MetNet can be used from anywhere not just aboard ships Being able to provide onsite visual information allows remote patients expert emergency help and medical attention that saves money as well as lives This has created a demand for athome monitoring Athome care has also become a large part of telehealth Doctors or nurses will now give preop and postop phone calls to checkin There are also companies such as Lifeline which give the elderly a button to press in case of an emergency That button will automatically call for emergency help If someone has surgery and then is sent home telehealth allows physicians to see how the patient is progressing without them having to stay in the hospital TeleDiagnostic Systems of San Francisco is a company that has created a device that monitors sleep patterns so people with sleep disorders do not have to stay the night at the hospital Another athome device that was created was the Wanderer which was attached to Alzheimers patients or people who had dementia It was attached to them so when they wandered off it notified the staff to allow them to go after them All these devices allowed healthcare beyond hospitals to improve which means that more people are being helped efficiently 2000s to present The advent of highspeed Internet and the increasing adoption of ICT in traditional methods of care spurred advances in telehealth delivery Increased access to portable devices like laptops and mobile phones made telehealth more plausible the industry then expanded into health promotion prevention and education In 2002 G Byron Brooks a former NASA surgeon and engineer who had also helped manage the UTMB Telemedicine program cofounded Teladoc in Dallas Texas which was then launched in 2005 as the first national telehealth provider In the 2010s integration of smart home telehealth technologies such as health and wellness devices software and integrated IoT has accelerated the industry Healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting the use of selftracking and cloudbased technologies and innovative data analytic approaches to accelerate telehealth delivery In 2015 Mercy Health system opened Mercy Virtual in Chesterfield Missouri the worlds first medical facility dedicated solely to telemedicine COVID19 Telehealth expanded significantly during the COVID19 pandemic becoming a vital means of medical communication It allows doctors to return to humanizing the patient It forces them to listen to what people have to say and from there make a diagnosis Studies have demonstrated high trust in telehealth expressed by patients during the COVID19 pandemic Some researchers claim this creates an environment that encourages greater vulnerability among patients in self disclosure in the practice of narrative medicine Telehealth allows for Zoom calls and video chats from across the world checking in on patients and speaking to physicians Universities are now ensuring that medical students graduate with proficient telehealth communication skills Experts suggest that telehealth has become a vital part of medical care with more virtual options becoming available The pandemic era also identified the potential to significantly improve global health equity through telehealth and other virtual care

    title: "Graphene",
    originalContent:
      "Graphene is a carbon allotrope consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a honeycomb planar nanostructure The name graphene is derived from graphite and the suffix ene indicating the presence of double bonds within the carbon structure Graphene is known for its exceptionally high tensile strength electrical conductivity transparency and being the thinnest twodimensional material in the world Despite the nearly transparent nature of a single graphene sheet graphite formed from stacked layers of graphene appears black because it absorbs all visible light wavelengths On a microscopic scale graphene is the strongest material ever measured The existence of graphene was first theorized in 1947 by Philip R Wallace during his research on graphites electronic properties In 2004 the material was isolated and characterized by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester using a piece of graphite and adhesive tape In 2010 Geim and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking experiments regarding the twodimensional material graphene While small amounts of graphene are easy to produce using the method by which it was originally isolated attempts to scale and automate the manufacturing process for mass production have had limited success due to costeffectiveness and quality control concerns The global graphene market was 9 million in 2012 with most of the demand from research and development in semiconductors electronics electric batteries and composites The IUPAC International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry advises using the term graphite for the threedimensional material and reserving graphene for discussions about the properties or reactions of singleatom layers A narrower definition of isolated or freestanding graphene requires that the layer be sufficiently isolated from its environment but would include layers suspended or transferred to silicon dioxide or silicon carbide History Structure of graphite and its intercalation compounds In 1859 Benjamin Brodie noted the highly lamellar structure of thermally reduced graphite oxide Pioneers in Xray crystallography attempted to determine the structure of graphite The lack of large single crystal graphite specimens contributed to the independent development of Xray powder diffraction by Peter Debye and Paul Scherrer in 1915 and Albert Hull in 1916 However neither of their proposed structures was correct In 1918 Volkmar Kohlschtter and P Haenni described the properties of graphite oxide paper The structure of graphite was successfully determined from singlecrystal Xray diffraction by J D Bernal in 1924 although subsequent research has made small modifications to the unit cell parameters The theory of graphene was first explored by P R Wallace in 1947 as a starting point for understanding the electronic properties of 3D graphite The emergent massless Dirac equation was separately pointed out in 1984 by Gordon Walter Semenoff and by David P Vincenzo and Eugene J Mele Semenoff emphasized the occurrence in a magnetic field of an electronic Landau level precisely at the Dirac point This level is responsible for the anomalous integer quantum Hall effect Observations of thin graphite layers and related structures Transmission electron microscopy TEM images of thin graphite samples consisting of a few graphene layers were published by G Ruess and F Vogt in 1948 Eventually single layers were also observed directly Single layers of graphite were also observed by transmission electron microscopy within bulk materials particularly inside soot obtained by chemical exfoliation From 1961 to 1962 HannsPeter Boehm published a study of extremely thin flakes of graphite The study measured flakes as small as 04 nm which is around 3 atomic layers of amorphous carbon This was the best possible resolution for TEMs in the 1960s However it is impossible to distinguish between suspended monolayer and multilayer graphene by their TEM contrasts and the only known method is to analyze the relative intensities of various diffraction spots The first reliable TEM observations of monolayers are likely given in references 24 and 26 of Geim and Novoselovs 2007 review In 1975 van Bommel et al epitaxially grew a single layer of graphite on top of silicon carbide Others grew single layers of carbon atoms on other materials This epitaxial graphene consists of a singleatomthick hexagonal lattice of sp2bonded carbon atoms as in freestanding graphene However there is significant charge transfer between the two materials and in some cases hybridization between the dorbitals of the substrate atoms and orbitals of graphene which significantly alter the electronic structure compared to that of freestanding graphene Boehm et al coined the term graphene for the hypothetical singlelayer structure in 1986 The term was used again in 1987 to describe single sheets of graphite as a constituent of graphite intercalation compounds which can be seen as crystalline salts of the intercalant and graphene It was also used in the descriptions of carbon nanotubes by R Saito and Mildred and Gene Dresselhaus in 1992 and in the description of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 2000 by S Wang and others Efforts to make thin films of graphite by mechanical exfoliation started in 1990 Initial attempts employed exfoliation techniques similar to the drawing method Multilayer samples down to 10 nm in thickness were obtained In 2002 Robert B Rutherford and Richard L Dudman filed for a patent in the US on a method to produce graphene by repeatedly peeling off layers from a graphite flake adhered to a substrate achieving a graphite thickness of 000001 inches 000025 millimetres The key to success was the ability to quickly and efficiently identify graphene flakes on the substrate using optical microscopy which provided a small but visible contrast between the graphene and the substrate Another US patent was filed in the same year by Bor Z Jang and Wen C Huang for a method to produce graphenebased on exfoliation followed by attrition In 2014 inventor Larry Fullerton patented a process for producing singlelayer graphene sheets Full isolation and characterization Graphene was properly isolated and characterized in 2004 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester They pulled graphene layers from graphite with a common adhesive tape in a process called micromechanical cleavage colloquially referred to as the Scotch tape technique The graphene flakes were then transferred onto a thin silicon dioxide layer on a silicon plate wafer The silica electrically isolated the graphene and weakly interacted with it providing nearly chargeneutral graphene layers The silicon beneath the SiO2 could be used as a back gate electrode to vary the charge density in the graphene over a wide range This work resulted in the two winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their groundbreaking experiments with graphene Their publication and the surprisingly easy preparation method that they described sparked a graphene gold rush Research expanded and split off into many different subfields exploring different exceptional properties of the materialquantum mechanical electrical chemical mechanical optical magnetic etc Exploring commercial applications Since the early 2000s several companies and research laboratories have been working to develop commercial applications of graphene In 2014 a National Graphene Institute was established with that purpose at the University of Manchester with a 60 million initial funding In North East England two commercial manufacturers Applied Graphene Materials and Thomas Swan Limited have begun manufacturing Cambridge Nanosystems is a largescale graphene powder production facility in East Anglia Structure Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms tightly bound in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice It is an allotrope of carbon in the form of a plane of sp2bonded atoms with a molecular bond length of 0142 nm 142 In a graphene sheet each atom is connected to its three nearest carbon neighbors by bonds and a delocalized bond which contributes to a valence band that extends over the whole sheet This type of bonding is also seen in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons The valence band is touched by a conduction band making graphene a semimetal with unusual electronic properties that are best described by theories for massless relativistic particles Charge carriers in graphene show linear rather than quadratic dependence of energy on momentum and fieldeffect transistors with graphene can be made that show bipolar conduction Charge transport is ballistic over long distances the material exhibits large quantum oscillations and large nonlinear diamagnetism Bonding Three of the four outershell electrons of each atom in a graphene sheet occupy three sp2 hybrid orbitals a combination of orbitals s px and py that are shared with the three nearest atoms forming bonds The length of these bonds is about 0142 nanometers The remaining outershell electron occupies a pz orbital that is oriented perpendicularly to the plane These orbitals hybridize together to form two halffilled bands of freemoving electrons and which are responsible for most of graphenes notable electronic properties Recent quantitative estimates of aromatic stabilization and limiting size derived from the enthalpies of hydrogenation Hhydro agree well with the literature reports Graphene sheets stack to form graphite with an interplanar spacing of 0335 nm 335 Graphene sheets in solid form usually show evidence in diffraction for graphites 002 layering This is true of some singlewalled nanostructures However unlayered graphene displaying only hk0 rings have been observed in the core of presolar graphite onions TEM studies show faceting at defects in flat graphene sheets and suggest a role for twodimensional crystallization from a melt Geometry The hexagonal lattice structure of isolated singlelayer graphene can be directly seen with transmission electron microscopy TEM of sheets of graphene suspended between bars of a metallic grid Some of these images showed a rippling of the flat sheet with an amplitude of about one nanometer These ripples may be intrinsic to the material as a result of the instability of twodimensional crystals or may originate from the ubiquitous dirt seen in all TEM images of graphene Photoresist residue which must be removed to obtain atomicresolution images may be the adsorbates observed in TEM images and may explain the observed rippling The hexagonal structure is also seen in scanning tunneling microscope STM images of graphene supported on silicon dioxide substrates The rippling seen in these images is caused by the conformation of graphene to the substrates lattice and is not intrinsic Stability Ab initio calculations show that a graphene sheet is thermodynamically unstable if its size is less than about 20 nm and becomes the most stable fullerene as within graphite only for molecules larger than 24000 atoms Electronic properties Graphene is a zerogap semiconductor because its conduction and valence bands meet at the Dirac points The Dirac points are six locations in momentum space on the edge of the Brillouin zone divided into two nonequivalent sets of three points These sets are labeled K and K These sets give graphene a valley degeneracy of g v 2 displaystyle g_v2 In contrast for traditional semiconductors the primary point of interest is generally where momentum is zero If the inplane direction is confined rather than infinite its electronic structure changes These confined structures are referred to as graphene nanoribbons If the nanoribbon has a zigzag edge the bandgap remains zero If it has an armchair edge the bandgap is nonzero Graphenes honeycomb structure can be viewed as two interleaving triangular lattices This perspective has been used to calculate the band structure for a single graphite layer using a tightbinding approximation Electronic spectrum Electrons propagating through the graphene honeycomb lattice effectively lose their mass producing quasiparticles described by a 2D analogue of the Dirac equation rather than the Schrdinger equation for spin12 particles Dispersion relation The cleavage technique led directly to the first observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene in 2005 by Geims group and by Philip Kim and Yuanbo Zhang This effect provided direct evidence of graphenes theoretically predicted Berrys phase of massless Dirac fermions and proof of the Dirac fermion nature of electrons These effects were previously observed in bulk graphite by Yakov Kopelevich Igor A Lukyanchuk and others in 20032004 When atoms are placed onto the graphene hexagonal lattice the overlap between the pz orbitals and the s or the px and py orbitals is zero by symmetry Therefore pz electrons forming the bands in graphene can be treated independently Within this band approximation using a conventional tightbinding model the dispersion relation restricted to firstnearestneighbor interactions only that produces the energy of the electrons with wave vector k is E k x k y 0 1 4 cos 2 1 2 a k x 4 cos 1 2 a k x cos 3 2 a k y displaystyle Ek_xk_ypm gamma _0sqrt 14cos 2tfrac 12ak_x4cos tfrac 12ak_xcdot cos tfrac sqrt 32ak_y with the nearestneighbor orbitals hopping energy 0 28 eV and the lattice constant a 246 The conduction and valence bands correspond to the different signs With one pz electron per atom in this model the valence band is fully occupied while the conduction band is vacant The two bands touch at the zone corners the K point in the Brillouin zone where there is a zero density of states but no band gap Thus graphene exhibits a semimetallic or zerogap semiconductor character although this is not true for a graphene sheet rolled into a carbon nanotube due to its curvature Two of the six Dirac points are independent while the rest are equivalent by symmetry Near the Kpoints the energy depends linearly on the wave vector similar to a relativistic particle Since an elementary cell of the lattice has a basis of two atoms the wave function has an effective 2spinor structure Consequently at low energies even neglecting the true spin electrons can be described by an equation formally equivalent to the massless Dirac equation Hence the electrons and holes are called Dirac fermions This pseudorelativistic description is restricted to the chiral limit ie to vanishing rest mass M0 leading to interesting additional features v F r E r displaystyle v_Fvec sigma cdot nabla psi mathbf r Epsi mathbf r Here vF 106 ms 003 c is the Fermi velocity in graphene which replaces the velocity of light in the Dirac theory displaystyle vec sigma is the vector of the Pauli matrices r displaystyle psi mathbf r is the twocomponent wave function of the electrons and E is their energy The equation describing the electrons linear dispersion relation is E q v F q displaystyle Eqhbar v_Fq where the wavevector q is measured from the Brillouin zone vertex K q k K displaystyle qleftmathbf k mathrm K right and the zero of energy is set to coincide with the Dirac point The equation uses a pseudospin matrix formula that describes two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice Singleatom wave propagation Electron waves in graphene propagate within a singleatom layer making them sensitive to the proximity of other materials such as high dielectrics superconductors and ferromagnetic Ambipolar electron and hole transport Graphene exhibits high electron mobility at room temperature with values reported in excess of 15000 cm2V1s1 Hole and electron mobilities are nearly identical The mobility is independent of temperature between 10 K and 100 K showing minimal change even at room temperature 300 K suggesting that the dominant scattering mechanism is defect scattering Scattering by graphenes acoustic phonons intrinsically limits room temperature mobility in freestanding graphene to 200000 cm2V1s1 at a carrier density of 1012 cm2 The corresponding resistivity of graphene sheets is 108 m lower than the resistivity of silver which is the lowest known at room temperature However on SiO2 substrates electron scattering by optical phonons of the substrate has a more significant effect than scattering by graphenes phonons limiting mobility to 40000 cm2V1s1 Charge transport can be affected by the adsorption of contaminants such as water and oxygen molecules leading to nonrepetitive and large hysteresis IV characteristics Researchers need to conduct electrical measurements in a vacuum Coating the graphene surface with materials such as SiN PMMA or hBN has been proposed for protection In January 2015 the first stable graphene device operation in the air over several weeks was reported for graphene whose surface was protected by aluminum oxide In 2015 lithiumcoated graphene exhibited superconductivity a first for graphene Electrical resistance in 40nanometerwide nanoribbons of epitaxial graphene changes in discrete steps The ribbons conductance exceeds predictions by a factor of 10 The ribbons can function more like optical waveguides or quantum dots allowing electrons to flow smoothly along the ribbon edges In copper resistance increases proportionally with length as electrons encounter impurities Transport is dominated by two modes one ballistic and temperatureindependent and the other thermally activated Ballistic electrons resemble those in cylindrical carbon nanotubes At room temperature resistance increases abruptly at a specific lengththe ballistic mode at 16 micrometers and the thermally activated mode at 160 nanometers 1 of the former length Graphene electrons can traverse micrometer distances without scattering even at room temperature Electrical conductivity and charge transport Despite zero carrier density near the Dirac points graphene exhibits a minimum conductivity on the order of 4 e 2 h displaystyle 4e2h The origin of this minimum conductivity is still unclear However rippling of the graphene sheet or ionized impurities in the SiO2 substrate may lead to local puddles of carriers that allow conduction Several theories suggest that the minimum conductivity should be 4 e 2 h displaystyle 4e2pi h however most measurements are of the order of 4 e 2 h displaystyle 4e2h or greater and depend on impurity concentration Near zero carrier density graphene exhibits positive photoconductivity and negative photoconductivity at high carrier density governed by the interplay between photoinduced changes of both the Drude weight and the carrier scattering rate Graphene doped with various gaseous species both acceptors and donors can be returned to an undoped state by gentle heating in a vacuum Even for dopant concentrations in excess of 1012 cm2 carrier mobility exhibits no observable change Graphene doped with potassium in ultrahigh vacuum at low temperature can reduce mobility 20fold The mobility reduction is reversible on heating the graphene to remove the potassium Due to graphenes two dimensions charge fractionalization where the apparent charge of individual pseudoparticles in lowdimensional systems is less than a single quantum is thought to occur It may therefore be a suitable material for constructing quantum computers using anyonic circuits Chiral halfinteger quantum Hall effect Quantum hall effect in graphene The quantum Hall effect is a quantum mechanical version of the Hall effect which is the production of transverse perpendicular to the main current conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field The quantization of the Hall effect x y displaystyle sigma _xy at integer multiples the Landau level of the basic quantity e2h where e is the elementary electric charge and h is the Planck constant It can usually be observed only in very clean silicon or gallium arsenide solids at temperatures around 3 K and very high magnetic fields Graphene shows the quantum Hall effect the conductivity quantization is unusual in that the sequence of steps is shifted by 12 with respect to the standard sequence and with an additional factor of 4 Graphenes Hall conductivity is x y 4 N 1 2 e 2 h displaystyle sigma _xypm 4cdot leftN12righte2h where N is the Landau level and the double valley and double spin degeneracies give the factor of 4 These anomalies are present not only at extremely low temperatures but also at room temperature ie at roughly 20 C 293 K Chiral electrons and anomalies This behavior is a direct result of graphenes chiral massless Dirac electrons In a magnetic field their spectrum has a Landau level with energy precisely at the Dirac point This level is a consequence of the AtiyahSinger index theorem and is halffilled in neutral graphene leading to the 12 in the Hall conductivity Bilayer graphene also shows the quantum Hall effect but with only one of the two anomalies ie x y 4 N e 2 h displaystyle sigma _xypm 4cdot Ncdot e2h In the second anomaly the first plateau at N 0 is absent indicating that bilayer graphene stays metallic at the neutrality point Unlike normal metals graphenes longitudinal resistance shows maxima rather than minima for integral values of the Landau filling factor in measurements of the Shubnikovde Haas oscillations thus the term integral quantum Hall effect These oscillations show a phase shift of known as Berrys phase Berrys phase arises due to chirality or dependence locking of the pseudospin quantum number on the momentum of lowenergy electrons near the Dirac points The temperature dependence of the oscillations reveals that the carriers have a nonzero cyclotron mass despite their zero effective mass in the Diracfermion formalism Experimental observations Graphene samples prepared on nickel films and on both the silicon face and carbon face of silicon carbide show the anomalous effect directly in electrical measurements Graphitic layers on the carbon face of silicon carbide show a clear Dirac spectrum in angleresolved photoemission experiments and the effect is observed in cyclotron resonance and tunneling experiments Massive electrons Graphenes unit cell has two identical carbon atoms and two zeroenergy states one where the electron resides on atom A and the other on atom B However if the unit cells two atoms are not identical the situation changes Research shows that placing hexagonal boron nitride hBN in contact with graphene can alter the potential felt at atoms A and B sufficiently for the electrons to develop a mass and an accompanying band gap of about 30 meV The mass can be positive or negative An arrangement that slightly raises the energy of an electron on atom A relative to atom B gives it a positive mass while an arrangement that raises the energy of atom B produces a negative electron mass The two versions behave alike and are indistinguishable via optical spectroscopy An electron traveling from a positivemass region to a negativemass region must cross an intermediate region where its mass once again becomes zero This region is gapless and therefore metallic Metallic modes bounding semiconducting regions of oppositesign mass is a hallmark of a topological phase and displays much the same physics as topological insulators If the mass in graphene can be controlled electrons can be confined to massless regions by surrounding them with massive regions allowing the patterning of quantum dots wires and other mesoscopic structures It also produces onedimensional conductors along the boundary These wires would be protected against backscattering and could carry currents without dissipation Interactions and phenomena Strong magnetic fields In magnetic fields above 10 tesla additional plateaus of the Hall conductivity at xy e2h with 0 1 4 are observed A plateau at 3 and the fractional quantum Hall effect at 13 were also reported These observations with 0 1 3 4 indicate that the fourfold degeneracy two valley and two spin degrees of freedom of the Landau energy levels is partially or completely lifted Casimir effect The Casimir effect is an interaction between disjoint neutral bodies provoked by the fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum Mathematically it can be explained by considering the normal modes of electromagnetic fields which explicitly depend on the boundary conditions on the interacting bodies surfaces Due to graphenes strong interaction with the electromagnetic field as a oneatomthick material the Casimir effect has garnered significant interest Van der Waals force The Van der Waals force or dispersion force is also unusual obeying an inverse cubic asymptotic power law in contrast to the usual inverse quartic law Permittivity Graphenes permittivity varies with frequency Over a range from microwave to millimeter wave frequencies it is approximately 33 This permittivity combined with its ability to function as both a conductor and as an insulator theoretically allows compact capacitors made of graphene to store large amounts of electrical energy Optical properties Graphene exhibits unique optical properties showing unexpectedly high opacity for an atomic monolayer in vacuum absorbing approximately 23 of light from visible to infrared wavelengths where is the finestructure constant This is due to the unusual lowenergy electronic structure of monolayer graphene characterized by electron and hole conical bands meeting at the Dirac point which is qualitatively different from more common quadratic massive bands Based on the SlonczewskiWeissMcClure SWMcC band model of graphite calculations using Fresnel equations in the thinfilm limit account for interatomic distance hopping values and frequency thus assessing optical conductance Experimental verification though confirmed lacks the precision required to improve upon existing techniques for determining the finestructure constant Multiparametric surface plasmon resonance Multiparametric surface plasmon resonance has been utilized to characterize both the thickness and refractive index of chemicalvapordeposition CVDgrown graphene films At a wavelength of 670 nm 67107 m measured refractive index and extinction coefficient values are 3135 and 0897 respectively Thickness determination yielded 37 across a 05mm area consistent with the 335 reported for layertolayer carbon atom distance of graphite crystals This method is applicable for realtime labelfree interactions of graphene with organic and inorganic substances The existence of unidirectional surface plasmons in nonreciprocal graphenebased gyrotropic interfaces has been theoretically demonstrated offering tunability from THz to nearinfrared and visible frequencies by controlling graphenes chemical potential Particularly the unidirectional frequency bandwidth can be 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than that achievable with metal under similar magnetic field conditions stemming from graphenes extremely small effective electron mass Tunable band gap and optical response Graphenes band gap can be tuned from 0 to 025 eV about 5micrometer wavelength by applying a voltage to a dualgate bilayer graphene fieldeffect transistor FET at room temperature The optical response of graphene nanoribbons is tunable into the terahertz regime by an applied magnetic fields Graphenegraphene oxide systems exhibit electrochromic behavior enabling tuning of both linear and ultrafast optical properties Graphenebased Bragg grating A graphenebased Bragg grating onedimensional photonic crystal has been fabricated demonstrating its capability to excite surface electromagnetic waves in periodic structure using a 633 nm 633107 m HeNe laser as the light source Saturable absorption Graphene exhibits unique saturable absorption which saturates when the input optical intensity exceeds a threshold value This nonlinear optical behavior termed saturable absorption occurs across the visible to nearinfrared spectrum due to graphenes universal optical absorption and zero band gap This property has enabled fullband modelocking in fiber lasers using graphenebased saturable absorbers contributing significantly to ultrafast photonics Additionally the optical response of graphenegraphene oxide layers can be electrically tuned Saturable absorption in graphene could occur at the Microwave and Terahertz band owing to its wideband optical absorption property The microwavesaturable absorption in graphene demonstrates the possibility of graphene microwaves and terahertz photonics devices such as a microwavesaturable absorber modulator polarizer microwave signal processing and broadband wireless access networks Nonlinear Kerr effect Under intense laser illumination graphene exhibits a nonlinear phase shift due to the optical nonlinear Kerr effect Graphene demonstrates a large nonlinear Kerr coefficient of 107 cm2W1 nearly nine orders of magnitude larger than that of bulk dielectrics suggesting its potential as a powerful nonlinear Kerr medium capable of supporting various nonlinear effects including solitons Excitonic properties Firstprinciple calculations incorporating quasiparticle corrections and manybody effects have been employed to study the electronic and optical properties of graphenebased materials The approach was described as three stages With GW calculation the properties of graphenebased materials were accurately investigated including bulk graphene nanoribbons edge and surface functionalized armchair ribbons hydrogen saturated armchair ribbons Josephson effect in graphene SNS junctions with single localized defect and armchair ribbon scaling properties Spin transport Graphene is considered an ideal material for spintronics due to its minimal spinorbit interaction the near absence of nuclear magnetic moments in carbon and weak hyperfine interaction Electrical injection and detection of spin current have been demonstrated up to room temperature with spin coherence length exceeding 1 micrometer observed at this temperature Control of spin current polarity via electrical gating has been achieved at low temperatures Magnetic properties Strong magnetic fields Graphenes quantum Hall effect in magnetic fields above approximately 10 tesla reveals additional interesting features Additional plateaus in Hall conductivity at x y e 2 h displaystyle sigma _xynu e2h with 0 1 4 displaystyle nu 0pm 1pm 4 have been observed along with plateau at 3 displaystyle nu 3 and a fractional quantum Hall effect at 1 3 displaystyle nu 13 These observations with 0 1 3 4 displaystyle nu 0pm 1pm 3pm 4 indicate that the fourfold degeneracy two valley and two spin degrees of freedom of the Landau energy levels is partially or completely lifted One hypothesis proposes that magnetic catalysis of symmetry breaking is responsible for this degeneracy lift Spintronic properties Graphene exhibits spintronic and magnetic properties concurrently Lowdefect graphene Nanomeshes fabricated using a nonlithographic approach exhibit significant ferromagnetism even at room temperature Additionally a spin pumping effect has been observed with fields applied in parallel to the planes of fewlayer ferromagnetic nanomeshes while a magnetoresistance hysteresis loop is evident under perpendicular fields Chargeneutral graphene has demonstrated magnetoresistance exceeding 100 in magnetic fields generated by standard permanent magnets approximately 01 tesla marking a record magneto resistivity at room temperature among known materials Magnetic substrates In 2014 researchers magnetized graphene by placing it on an atomically smooth layer of magnetic yttrium iron garnet maintaining graphenes electronic properties unaffected Previous methods involved doping graphene with other substances The dopants presence negatively affected its electronic properties Mechanical properties The twodimensional density of graphene is 0763 mg per square meter Graphene is the strongest material ever tested with an intrinsic tensile strength of 130 GPa 19000000 psi with representative engineering tensile strength 5060 GPa for stretching largearea freestanding graphene and a Youngs modulus stiffness close to 1 TPa 150000000 psi The Nobel announcement illustrated this by saying that a 1 square meter graphene hammock would support a 4 kg cat but would weigh only as much as one of the cats whiskers at 077 mg about 0001 of the weight of 1 m2 of paper Largeangle bending of graphene monolayers with minimal strain demonstrates its mechanical robustness Even under extreme deformation monolayer graphene maintains excellent carrier mobility The spring constant of suspended graphene sheets has been measured using an atomic force microscope AFM Graphene sheets were suspended over SiO2 cavities where an AFM tip was used to apply stress to the sheet to test its mechanical properties Its spring constant was in the range 15 Nm and the stiffness was 05 TPa which differs from that of bulk graphite These intrinsic properties could lead to applications such as NEMS as pressure sensors and resonators Due to its large surface energy and out of plane ductility flat graphene sheets are unstable with respect o scrolling ie bending into a cylindrical shape which is its lowerenergy state In twodimensional structures like graphene thermal and quantum fluctuations cause relative displacement with fluctuations growing logarithmically with structure size as per the MerminWagner theorem This shows that the amplitude of longwavelength fluctuations grows logarithmically with the scale of a 2D structure and would therefore be unbounded in structures of infinite size Local deformation and elastic strain are negligibly affected by this longrange divergence in relative displacement It is believed that a sufficiently large 2D structure in the absence of applied lateral tension will bend and crumple to form a fluctuating 3D structure Researchers have observed ripples in suspended layers of graphene and it has been proposed that the ripples are caused by thermal fluctuations in the material As a consequence of these dynamical deformations it is debatable whether graphene is truly a 2D structure These ripples when amplified by vacancy defects induce a negative Poissons ratio into graphene resulting in the thinnest auxetic material known so far Graphenenickel Ni composites created through plating processes exhibit enhanced mechanical properties due to strong Nigraphene interactions inhibiting dislocation sliding in the Ni matrix Fracture toughness In 2014 researchers from Rice University and the Georgia Institute of Technology have indicated that despite its strength graphene is also relatively brittle with a fracture toughness of about 4 MPam This indicates that imperfect graphene is likely to crack in a brittle manner like ceramic materials as opposed to many metallic materials which tend to have fracture toughness in the range of 1550 MPam Later in 2014 the Rice team announced that graphene showed a greater ability to distribute force from an impact than any known material ten times that of steel per unit weight The force was transmitted at 222 kilometres per second 138 mis Polycrystalline graphene Various methods most notably chemical vapor deposition CVD as discussed in the section below have been developed to produce largescale graphene needed for device applications Such methods often synthesize polycrystalline graphene The mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene are affected by the nature of the defects such as grainboundaries GB and vacancies present in the system and the average grainsize Graphene grain boundaries typically contain heptagonpentagon pairs The arrangement of such defects depends on whether the GB is in a zigzag or armchair direction It further depends on the tiltangle of the GB In 2010 researchers from Brown University computationally predicted that as the tiltangle increases the grain boundary strength also increases They showed that the weakest link in the grain boundary is at the critical bonds of the heptagon rings As the grain boundary angle increases the strain in these heptagon rings decreases causing the grain boundary to be stronger than lowerangle GBs They proposed that in fact for sufficiently large angle GB the strength of the GB is similar to pristine graphene In 2012 it was further shown that the strength can increase or decrease depending on the detailed arrangements of the defects These predictions have since been supported by experimental evidence In a 2013 study led by James Hones group researchers probed the elastic stiffness and strength of CVDgrown graphene by combining nanoindentation and highresolution TEM They found that the elastic stiffness is identical and strength is only slightly lower than those in pristine graphene In the same year researchers from University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles probed bicrystalline graphene with TEM and AFM They found that the strength of grain boundaries indeed tends to increase with the tilt angle While the presence of vacancies is not only prevalent in polycrystalline graphene vacancies can have significant effects on the strength of graphene The consensus is that the strength decreases along with increasing densities of vacancies Various studies have shown that for graphene with a sufficiently low density of vacancies the strength does not vary significantly from that of pristine graphene On the other hand a high density of vacancies can severely reduce the strength of graphene Compared to the fairly wellunderstood nature of the effect that grain boundary and vacancies have on the mechanical properties of graphene there is no clear consensus on the general effect that the average grain size has on the strength of polycrystalline graphene In fact three notable theoretical or computational studies on this topic have led to three different conclusions First in 2012 Kolakowski and Myer studied the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene with realistic atomistic model using moleculardynamics MD simulation To emulate the growth mechanism of CVD they first randomly selected nucleation sites that are at least 5A arbitrarily chosen apart from other sites Polycrystalline graphene was generated from these nucleation sites and was subsequently annealed at 3000K and then quenched Based on this model they found that cracks are initiated at grainboundary junctions but the grain size does not significantly affect the strength Second in 2013 Z Song et al used MD simulations to study the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene with uniformsized hexagonshaped grains The hexagon grains were oriented in various lattice directions and the GBs consisted of only heptagon pentagon and hexagonal carbon rings The motivation behind such a model was that similar systems had been experimentally observed in graphene flakes grown on the surface of liquid copper While they also noted that crack is typically initiated at the triple junctions they found that as the grain size decreases the yield strength of graphene increases Based on this finding they proposed that polycrystalline follows pseudo HallPetch relationship Third in 2013 Z D Sha et al studied the effect of grain size on the properties of polycrystalline graphene by modeling the grain patches using Voronoi construction The GBs in this model consisted of heptagons pentagons and hexagons as well as squares octagons and vacancies Through MD simulation contrary to the aforementioned study they found an inverse HallPetch relationship where the strength of graphene increases as the grain size increases Experimental observations and other theoretical predictions also gave differing conclusions similar to the three given above Such discrepancies show the complexity of the effects that grain size arrangements of defects and the nature of defects have on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene Other properties Thermal conductivity Thermal transport in graphene is a burgeoning area of research particularly for its potential applications in thermal management Most experimental measurements have posted large uncertainties in the results of thermal conductivity due to the limitations of the instruments used Following predictions for graphene and related carbon nanotubes early measurements of the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene reported an exceptionally large thermal conductivity up to 5300 Wm1K1 compared with the thermal conductivity of pyrolytic graphite of approximately 2000 Wm1K1 at room temperature However later studies primarily on more scalable but more defected graphene derived by Chemical Vapor Deposition have been unable to reproduce such high thermal conductivity measurements producing a wide range of thermal conductivities between 1500 2500 Wm1K1 for suspended singlelayer graphene The large range in the reported thermal conductivity can be caused by large measurement uncertainties as well as variations in the graphene quality and processing conditions In addition it is known that when singlelayer graphene is supported on an amorphous material the thermal conductivity is reduced to about 500 600 Wm1K1 at room temperature as a result of scattering of graphene lattice waves by the substrate and can be even lower for fewlayer graphene encased in amorphous oxide Likewise polymeric residue can contribute to a similar decrease in the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene to approximately 500 600 Wm1K1 for bilayer graphene Isotopic composition specifically the ratio of 12C to 13C significantly affects graphenes thermal conductivity Isotopically pure 12C graphene exhibits higher thermal conductivity than either a 5050 isotope ratio or the naturally occurring 991 ratio It can be shown by using the WiedemannFranz law that the thermal conduction is phonondominated However for a gated graphene strip an applied gate bias causing a Fermi energy shift much larger than kBT can cause the electronic contribution to increase and dominate over the phonon contribution at low temperatures The ballistic thermal conductance of graphene is isotropic Graphite a 3D counterpart to graphene exhibits a basal plane thermal conductivity exceeding 1000 Wm1K1 similar to diamond In graphite the caxis out of plane thermal conductivity is over a factor of 100 smaller due to the weak binding forces between basal planes as well as the larger lattice spacing In addition the ballistic thermal conductance of graphene is shown to give the lower limit of the ballistic thermal conductance per unit circumference length of carbon nanotubes Graphenes thermal conductivity is influenced by its three acoustic phonon modes two linear dispersion relation dispersion relation inplane modes LA TA and one quadratic dispersion relation outofplane mode ZA At low temperatures the dominance of the T15 thermal conductivity contribution of the outofplane mode supersedes the T2 dependence of the linear modes Some graphene phonon bands exhibit negative Grneisen parameters resulting in negative thermal expansion coefficient at low temperatures The lowest negative Grneisen parameters correspond to the lowest transverse acoustic ZA modes whose frequencies increase with inplane lattice parameter akin to a stretched string with higher frequency vibrations Chemical properties Graphene has a theoretical specific surface area SSA of 2630 m2g This is much larger than that reported to date for carbon black typically smaller than 900 m2g or for carbon nanotubes CNTs from 100 to 1000 m2g and is similar to activated carbon Graphene is the only form of carbon or solid material in which every atom is available for chemical reaction from two sides due to the 2D structure Atoms at the edges of a graphene sheet have special chemical reactivity Graphene has the highest ratio of edge atoms of any allotrope Defects within a sheet increase its chemical reactivity The onset temperature of reaction between the basal plane of singlelayer graphene and oxygen gas is below 260 C 530 K Graphene burns at very low temperatures eg 350 C 620 K Graphene is commonly modified with oxygen and nitrogencontaining functional groups and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy However the determination of structures of graphene with oxygen and nitrogen functional groups require the structures to be well controlled In 2013 Stanford University physicists reported that singlelayer graphene is a hundred times more chemically reactive than thicker multilayer sheets Graphene can selfrepair holes in its sheets when exposed to molecules containing carbon such as hydrocarbons Bombarded with pure carbon atoms the atoms perfectly align into hexagons filling the holes Biological properties Despite the promising results in different cell studies and proof of concept studies there is still incomplete understanding of the full biocompatibility of graphenebased materials Different cell lines react differently when exposed to graphene and it has been shown that the lateral size of the graphene flakes the form and surface chemistry can elicit different biological responses on the same cell line There are indications that graphene has promise as a useful material for interacting with neural cells studies on cultured neural cells show limited success Graphene also has some utility in osteogenesis Researchers at the Graphene Research Centre at the National University of Singapore NUS discovered in 2011 the ability of graphene to accelerate the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells without the use of biochemical inducers Graphene can be used in biosensors in 2015 researchers demonstrated that a graphenebased sensor can be used to detect a cancer risk biomarker In particular by using epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide they were repeatedly able to detect 8hydroxydeoxyguanosine 8OHdG a DNA damage biomarker Support substrate The electronic property of graphene can be significantly influenced by the supporting substrate Studies of graphene monolayers on clean and hydrogenHpassivated silicon 100 Si100H surfaces have been performed The Si100H surface does not perturb the electronic properties of graphene whereas the interaction between the clean Si100 surface and graphene changes the electronic states of graphene significantly This effect results from the covalent bonding between C and surface Si atoms modifying the orbital network of the graphene layer The local density of states shows that the bonded C and Si surface states are highly disturbed near the Fermi energy Graphene layers and structural variants Monolayer sheets In 2013 a group of Polish scientists presented a production unit that allows the manufacture of continuous monolayer sheets The process is based on graphene growth on a liquid metal matrix The product of this process was called High Strength Metallurgical Graphene In a new study published in Nature the researchers have used a singlelayer graphene electrode and a novel surfacesensitive nonlinear spectroscopy technique to investigate the topmost water layer at the electrochemically charged surface They found that the interfacial water response to the applied electric field is asymmetric concerning the nature of the applied field Bilayer graphene Bilayer graphene displays the anomalous quantum Hall effect a tunable band gap and potential for excitonic condensation making it a promising candidate for optoelectronic and nanoelectronic applications Bilayer graphene typically can be found either in twisted configurations where the two layers are rotated relative to each other or graphitic Bernal stacked configurations where half the atoms in one layer lie atop half the atoms in the other Stacking order and orientation govern the optical and electronic properties of bilayer graphene One way to synthesize bilayer graphene is via chemical vapor deposition which can produce large bilayer regions that almost exclusively conform to a Bernal stack geometry It has been shown that the two graphene layers can withstand important strain or doping mismatch which ultimately should lead to their exfoliation Turbostratic Turbostratic graphene exhibits weak interlayer coupling and the spacing is increased with respect to Bernalstacked multilayer graphene Rotational misalignment preserves the 2D electronic structure as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy The D peak is very weak whereas the 2D and G peaks remain prominent A rather peculiar feature is that the I2DIG ratio can exceed 10 However most importantly the M peak which originates from AB stacking is absent whereas the TS1 and TS2 modes are visible in the Raman spectrum The material is formed through conversion of nongraphenic carbon into graphenic carbon without providing sufficient energy to allow for the reorganization through annealing of adjacent graphene layers into crystalline graphitic structures Graphene superlattices Periodically stacked graphene and its insulating isomorph provide a fascinating structural element in implementing highly functional superlattices at the atomic scale which offers possibilities for designing nanoelectronic and photonic devices Various types of superlattices can be obtained by stacking graphene and its related forms The energy band in layerstacked superlattices is found to be more sensitive to the barrier width than that in conventional IIIV semiconductor superlattices When adding more than one atomic layer to the barrier in each period the coupling of electronic wavefunctions in neighboring potential wells can be significantly reduced which leads to the degeneration of continuous subbands into quantized energy levels When varying the well width the energy levels in the potential wells along the LM direction behave distinctly from those along the KH direction A superlattice corresponds to a periodic or quasiperiodic arrangement of different materials and can be described by a superlattice period which confers a new translational symmetry to the system impacting their phonon dispersions and subsequently their thermal transport properties Recently uniform monolayer graphenehBN structures have been successfully synthesized via lithography patterning coupled with chemical vapor deposition CVD Furthermore superlattices of grapheneHBN are ideal model systems for the realization and understanding of coherent wavelike and incoherent particlelike phonon thermal transport Nanostructured graphene forms Graphene nanoribbons Graphene nanoribbons nanostripes in the zigzagzigzag orientation at low temperatures show spinpolarized metallic edge currents which also suggests applications in the new field of spintronics In the armchair orientation the edges behave like semiconductors Graphene quantum dots A graphene quantum dot GQD is a graphene fragment with a size lesser than 100 nm The properties of GQDs are different from bulk graphene due to the quantum confinement effects which only become apparent when the size is smaller than 100 nm Modified and functionalized graphene Graphene oxide Graphene oxide is usually produced through chemical exfoliation of graphite A particularly popular technique is the improved Hummers method Using papermaking techniques on dispersed oxidized and chemically processed graphite in water the monolayer flakes form a single sheet and create strong bonds These sheets called graphene oxide paper have a measured tensile modulus of 32 GPa The chemical property of graphite oxide is related to the functional groups attached to graphene sheets These can change the polymerization pathway and similar chemical processes Graphene oxide flakes in polymerss display enhanced photoconducting properties Graphene is normally hydrophobic and impermeable to all gases and liquids vacuumtight However when formed into a graphene oxidebased capillary membrane both liquid water and water vapor flow through as quickly as if the membrane were not present In 2022 researchers evaluated the biological effects of low doses on graphene oxide on larvae and imago of Drosophila melanogaster Results show that oral administration of graphene oxide at concentrations of 0021 has a beneficial effect on the developmental rate and hatching ability of larvae Longterm administration of a low dose of graphene oxide extends the lifespan of Drosophila and significantly enhances resistance to environmental stresses These suggest that graphene oxide affects carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in adult Drosophila These findings might provide a useful reference to assess the biological effects of graphene oxide which could play an important role in a variety of graphenebased biomedical applications Chemical modification Soluble fragments of graphene can be prepared in the laboratory through chemical modification of graphite First microcrystalline graphite is treated with an acidic mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid A series of oxidation and exfoliation steps produce small graphene plates with carboxyl groups at their edges These are converted to acid chloride groups by treatment with thionyl chloride next they are converted to the corresponding graphene amide via treatment with octadecyl amine The resulting material circular graphene layers of 53 or 531010 m thickness is soluble in tetrahydrofuran tetrachloromethane and dichloroethane Refluxing singlelayer graphene oxide SLGO in solvents leads to size reduction and folding of individual sheets as well as loss of carboxylic group functionality by up to 20 indicating thermal instabilities of SLGO sheets dependent on their preparation methodology When using thionyl chloride acyl chloride groups result which can then form aliphatic and aromatic amides with a reactivity conversion of around 7080 Hydrazine reflux is commonly used for reducing SLGO to SLGR but titrations show that only around 2030 of the carboxylic groups are lost leaving a significant number available for chemical attachment Analysis of SLGR generated by this route reveals that the system is unstable and using a room temperature stirring with hydrochloric acid 10 M leads to around 60 loss of COOH functionality Room temperature treatment of SLGO with carbodiimides leads to the collapse of the individual sheets into starlike clusters that exhibited poor subsequent reactivity with amines c 35 conversion of the intermediate to the final amide It is apparent that conventional chemical treatment of carboxylic groups on SLGO generates morphological changes of individual sheets that leads to a reduction in chemical reactivity which may potentially limit their use in composite synthesis Therefore chemical reaction types have been explored SLGO has also been grafted with polyallylamine crosslinked through epoxy groups When filtered into graphene oxide paper these composites exhibit increased stiffness and strength relative to unmodified graphene oxide paper Full hydrogenation from both sides of the graphene sheet results in Graphane but partial hydrogenation leads to hydrogenated graphene Similarly bothside fluorination of graphene or chemical and mechanical exfoliation of graphite fluoride leads to fluorographene graphene fluoride while partial fluorination generally halogenation provides fluorinated halogenated graphene Graphene ligandcomplex Graphene can be a ligand to coordinate metals and metal ions by introducing functional groups Structures of graphene ligands are similar to eg metalporphyrin complex metalphthalocyanine complex and metalphenanthroline complex Copper and nickel ions can be coordinated with graphene ligands Advanced graphene structures Graphene fiber In 2011 researchers reported a novel yet simple approach to fabricating graphene fibers from chemical vapor depositiongrown graphene films The method was scalable and controllable delivering tunable morphology and pore structure by controlling the evaporation of solvents with suitable surface tension Flexible allsolidstate supercapacitors based on these graphene fibers were demonstrated in 2013 In 2015 intercalating small graphene fragments into the gaps formed by larger coiled graphene sheets after annealing provided pathways for conduction while the fragments helped reinforce the fibers The resulting fibers offered better thermal and electrical conductivity and mechanical strength Thermal conductivity reached 1290 WmK 1290 watts per metre per kelvin while tensile strength reached 1080 MPa 157000 psi In 2016 kilometerscale continuous graphene fibers with outstanding mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity were produced by highthroughput wetspinning of graphene oxide liquid crystals followed by graphitization through a fullscale synergetic defectengineering strategy The graphene fibers with superior performances promise wide applications in functional textiles lightweight motors microelectronic devices etc Tsinghua University in Beijing led by Wei Fei of the Department of Chemical Engineering claims to be able to create a carbon nanotube fiber that has a tensile strength of 80 GPa 12000000 psi 3D graphene In 2013 a threedimensional honeycomb of hexagonally arranged carbon was termed 3D graphene and selfsupporting 3D graphene was also produced 3D structures of graphene can be fabricated by using either CVD or solutionbased methods A 2016 review by Khurram and Xu et al provided a summary of thenstateoftheart techniques for fabrication of the 3D structure of graphene and other related twodimensional materials In 2013 researchers at Stony Brook University reported a novel radicalinitiated crosslinking method to fabricate porous 3D freestanding architectures of graphene and carbon nanotubes using nanomaterials as building blocks without any polymer matrix as support These 3D graphenes allcarbon scaffoldsfoams have applications in several fields such as energy storage filtration thermal management and biomedical devices and implants Boxshaped graphene BSG nanostructure appearing after mechanical cleavage of pyrolytic graphite was reported in 2016 The discovered nanostructure is a multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the surface and having quadrangular crosssection The thickness of the channel walls is approximately equal to 1 nm Potential fields of BSG application include ultrasensitive detectors highperformance catalytic cells nanochannels for DNA sequencing and manipulation highperformance heat sinking surfaces rechargeable batteries of enhanced performance nanomechanical resonators electron multiplication channels in emission Nanoelectronic devices highcapacity sorbents for safe hydrogen storage Three dimensional bilayer graphene has also been reported Pillared graphene Pillared graphene is a hybrid carbon structure consisting of an oriented array of carbon nanotubes connected at each end to a sheet of graphene It was first described theoretically by George Froudakis and colleagues at the University of Crete in Greece in 2008 Pillared graphene has not yet been synthesized in the laboratory but it has been suggested that it may have useful electronic properties or as a hydrogen storage material Reinforced graphene Graphene reinforced with embedded carbon nanotube reinforcing bars rebar is easier to manipulate while improving the electrical and mechanical qualities of both materials Functionalized single or multiwalled carbon nanotubes are spincoated on copper foils and then heated and cooled using the nanotubes themselves as the carbon source Under heating the functional carbon groups decompose into graphene while the nanotubes partially split and form inplane covalent bonds with the graphene adding strength stacking domains add more strength The nanotubes can overlap making the material a better conductor than standard CVDgrown graphene The nanotubes effectively bridge the grain boundaries found in conventional graphene The technique eliminates the traces of substrate on which laterseparated sheets were deposited using epitaxy Stacks of a few layers have been proposed as a costeffective and physically flexible replacement for indium tin oxide ITO used in displays and photovoltaic cells Molded graphene In 2015 researchers from the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign UIUC developed a new approach for forming 3D shapes from flat 2D sheets of graphene A film of graphene that had been soaked in solvent to make it swell and become malleable was overlaid on an underlying substrate former The solvent evaporated over time leaving behind a layer of graphene that had taken on the shape of the underlying structure In this way they were able to produce a range of relatively intricate microstructured shapes Features vary from 35 to 50 m Pure graphene and golddecorated graphene were each successfully integrated with the substrate Specialized graphene configurations Graphene aerogel An aerogel made of graphene layers separated by carbon nanotubes was measured at 016 milligrams per cubic centimeter A solution of graphene and carbon nanotubes in a mold is freezedried to dehydrate the solution leaving the aerogel The material has superior elasticity and absorption It can recover completely after more than 90 compression and absorb up to 900 times its weight in oil at a rate of 688 grams per second Graphene nanocoil In 2015 a coiled form of graphene was discovered in graphitic carbon coal The spiraling effect is produced by defects in the materials hexagonal grid that causes it to spiral along its edge mimicking a Riemann surface with the graphene surface approximately perpendicular to the axis When voltage is applied to such a coil current flows around the spiral producing a magnetic field The phenomenon applies to spirals with either zigzag or armchair patterns although with different current distributions Computer simulations indicated that a conventional spiral inductor of 205 microns in diameter could be matched by a nanocoil just 70 nanometers wide with a field strength reaching as much as 1 tesla The nanosolenoids analyzed through computer models at Rice University should be capable of producing powerful magnetic fields of about 1 tesla about the same as the coils found in typical loudspeakers according to Yakobson and his team and about the same field strength as some MRI machines They found the magnetic field would be strongest in the hollow nanometerwide cavity at the spirals center A solenoid made with such a coil behaves as a quantum conductor whose current distribution between the core and exterior varies with applied voltage resulting in nonlinear inductance Crumpled graphene In 2016 Brown University introduced a method for crumpling graphene adding wrinkles to the material on a nanoscale This was achieved by depositing layers of graphene oxide onto a shrink film then shrunken with the film dissolved before being shrunken again on another sheet of film The crumpled graphene became superhydrophobic and when used as a battery electrode the material was shown to have as much as a 400 increase in electrochemical current density Mechanical synthesis A rapidly increasing list of production techniques have been developed to enable graphenes use in commercial applications Isolated 2D crystals cannot be grown via chemical synthesis beyond small sizes even in principle because the rapid growth of phonon density with increasing lateral size forces 2D crystallites to bend into the third dimension In all cases graphene must bond to a substrate to retain its twodimensional shape Bottomup and topdown methods Small graphene structures such as graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons can be produced by bottomup methods that assemble the lattice from organic molecule monomers e g citric acid glucose Topdown methods on the other hand cut bulk graphite and graphene materials with strong chemicals e g mixed acids Micromechanical cleavage The most famous clean and rather straightforward method of isolating graphene sheets called micromechanical cleavage or more colloquially called the scotch tape method was introduced by Novoselov et al in 2004 which uses adhesive tape to mechanically cleave highquality graphite crystals into successively thinner platelets Other methods do exist like exfoliation Exfoliation techniques Mechanical exfoliation Geim and Novoselov initially used adhesive tape to pull graphene sheets away from graphite Achieving single layers typically requires multiple exfoliation steps After exfoliation the flakes are deposited on a silicon wafer Crystallites larger than 1 mm and visible to the naked eye can be obtained As of 2014 exfoliation produced graphene with the lowest number of defects and highest electron mobility Alternatively a sharp singlecrystal diamond wedge can penetrate onto the graphite source to cleave layers In the same year defectfree unoxidized graphenecontaining liquids were made from graphite using mixers that produce local shear rates greater than 10104 Shear exfoliation is another method in which by using a rotorstator mixer the scalable production of defectfree graphene has become possible It has been shown that as turbulence is not necessary for mechanical exfoliation ResonantAcoustic mixing or low speed ball milling is effective in the production of highyield and watersoluble graphene Liquid phase exfoliation Liquid phase exfoliation LPE is a relatively simple method that involves dispersing graphite in a liquid medium to produce graphene by sonication or high shear mixing followed by centrifugation Restacking is an issue with this technique unless solvents with appropriate surface energy are used eg NMP Adding a surfactant to a solvent prior to sonication prevents restacking by adsorbing to the graphenes surface This produces a higher graphene concentration but removing the surfactant requires chemical treatments LPE results in nanosheets with a broad size distribution and thicknesses roughly in the range of 110 monolayers However liquid cascade centrifugation can be used to sizeselect the suspensions and achieve monolayer enrichment Sonicating graphite at the interface of two immiscible liquids most notably heptane and water produced macroscale graphene films The graphene sheets are adsorbed to the highenergy interface between the materials and are kept from restacking The sheets are up to about 95 transparent and conductive With definite cleavage parameters the boxshaped graphene BSG nanostructure can be prepared on graphite crystal A major advantage of LPE is that it can be used to exfoliate many inorganic 2D materials beyond graphene eg BN MoS2 WS2 Exfoliation with supercritical carbon dioxide Liquidphase exfoliation can also be done by a lessknown process of intercalating supercritical carbon dioxide scCO2 into the interstitial spaces in the graphite lattice followed by rapid depressurization The scCO2 intercalates easily inside the graphite lattice at a pressure of roughly 100 atm Carbon dioxide turns gaseous as soon as the vessel is depressurized and makes the graphite explode into fewlayered graphene This method may have multiple advantages being nontoxic the graphite does not have to be chemically treated in any way before the process and the whole process can be completed in a single step as opposed to other exfoliation methods Splitting monolayer carbon allotropes Graphene can be created by opening carbon nanotubes by cutting or etching In one such method multiwalled carbon nanotubes were cut open in solution by action of potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid In 2014 carbon nanotubereinforced graphene was made via spin coating and annealing functionalized carbon nanotubes Another approach sprays buckyballs at supersonic speeds onto a substrate The balls cracked open upon impact and the resulting unzipped cages then bond together to form a graphene film Chemical synthesis Graphite oxide reduction P Boehm reported producing monolayer flakes of reduced graphene oxide in 1962 Rapid heating of graphite oxide and exfoliation yields highly dispersed carbon powder with a few percent of graphene flakes Another method is the reduction of graphite oxide monolayer films eg by hydrazine with annealing in argonhydrogen with an almost intact carbon framework that allows efficient removal of functional groups Measured charge carrier mobility exceeded 1000 cmVs 10 mVs Burning a graphite oxide coated DVD produced a conductive graphene film 1738 siemens per meter and specific surface area 1520 square meters per gram that was highly resistant and malleable A dispersed reduced graphene oxide suspension was synthesized in water by a hydrothermal dehydration method without using any surfactant The approach is facile industrially applicable environmentally friendly and costeffective Viscosity measurements confirmed that the graphene colloidal suspension graphene nanofluid exhibits Newtonian behavior with the viscosity showing a close resemblance to that of water Molten salts Graphite particles can be corroded in molten salts to form a variety of carbon nanostructures including graphene Hydrogen cations dissolved in molten lithium chloride can be discharged on cathodicallypolarized graphite rods which then intercalate peeling graphene sheets The graphene nanosheets produced displayed a singlecrystalline structure with a lateral size of several hundred nanometers and a high degree of crystallinity and thermal stability Electrochemical synthesis Electrochemical synthesis can exfoliate graphene Varying a pulsed voltage controls thickness flake area and number of defects and affects its properties The process begins by bathing the graphite in a solvent for intercalation The process can be tracked by monitoring the solutions transparency with an LED and photodiode Hydrothermal selfassembly Graphene has been prepared by using a sugar like glucose fructose etc This substratefree bottomup synthesis is safer simpler and more environmentally friendly than exfoliation The method can control the thickness ranging from monolayer to multilayer which is known as the TangLau Method Sodium ethoxide pyrolysis Gramquantities were produced by the reaction of ethanol with sodium metal followed by pyrolysis and washing with water Microwaveassisted oxidation In 2012 microwave energy was reported to directly synthesize graphene in one step This approach avoids use of potassium permanganate in the reaction mixture It was also reported that by microwave radiation assistance graphene oxide with or without holes can be synthesized by controlling microwave time Microwave heating can dramatically shorten the reaction time from days to seconds Graphene can also be made by microwave assisted hydrothermal pyrolysis Thermal decomposition of silicon carbide Heating silicon carbide SiC to high temperatures 1100 C under low pressures c 106 torr or 104 Pa reduces it to graphene Vapor deposition and growth techniques Chemical vapor deposition Epitaxy Epitaxial graphene growth on silicon carbide is a waferscale technique to produce graphene Epitaxial graphene may be coupled to surfaces weakly enough by the active valence electrons that create Van

naturally forming germanium oxide groups creating hydrogenterminated germanium CVD can coat that with graphene The direct synthesis of graphene on insulator TiO2 with highdielectricconstant high A twostep CVD process is shown to grow graphene directly on TiO2 crystals or exfoliated TiO2 nanosheets without using any metal catalyst Metal substrates CVD graphene can be grown on metal substrates including ruthenium iridium nickel and copper Rolltoroll In 2014 a twostep rolltoroll manufacturing process was announced The first rolltoroll step produces the graphene via chemical vapor deposition The second step binds the graphene to a substrate Cold wall Growing graphene in an industrial resistiveheating cold wall CVD system was claimed to produce graphene 100 times faster than conventional CVD systems cut costs by 99 and produce material with enhanced electronic qualities Wafer scale CVD graphene CVD graphene is scalable and has been grown on deposited Cu thin film catalyst on 100 to 300 mm standard SiSiO2 wafers on an Axitron Black Magic system Monolayer graphene coverage of 95 is achieved on 100 to 300 mm wafer substrates with negligible defects confirmed by extensive Raman mapping Solvent interface trapping method SITM As reported by a group led by D H Adamson graphene can be produced from natural graphite while preserving the integrity of the sheets using the solvent interface trapping method SITM SITM uses a highenergy interface such as oil and water to exfoliate graphite to graphene Stacked graphite delaminates or spreads at the oilwater interface to produce fewlayer graphene in a thermodynamically favorable process in much the same way as small molecule surfactants spread to minimize the interfacial energy In this way graphene behaves like a 2D surfactant SITM has been reported for a variety of applications such conductive polymergraphene foams conductive polymergraphene microspheres conductive thin films and conductive inks Carbon dioxide reduction A highly exothermic reaction combusts magnesium in an oxidationreduction reaction with carbon dioxide producing carbon nanoparticles including graphene and fullerenes Supersonic spray Supersonic acceleration of droplets through a Laval nozzle was used to deposit reduced graphene oxide on a substrate The energy of the impact rearranges those carbon atoms into flawless graphene Laser In 2014 a CO2 infrared laser was used to produce patterned porous threedimensional laserinduced graphene LIG film networks from commercial polymer films The resulting material exhibits high electrical conductivity and surface area The laser induction process is compatible with rolltoroll manufacturing processes A similar material laserinduced graphene fibers LIGF was reported in 2018 Flash Joule heating In 2019 flash Joule heating transient hightemperature electrothermal heating was discovered to be a method to synthesize turbostratic graphene in bulk powder form The method involves electrothermally converting various carbon sources such as carbon black coal and food waste into micronscale flakes of graphene More recent works demonstrated the use of mixed plastic waste waste rubber tires and pyrolysis ash as carbon feedstocks The graphenization process is kinetically controlled and the energy dose is chosen to preserve the carbon in its graphenic state excessive energy input leads to subsequent graphitization through annealing Ion implantation Accelerating carbon ions inside an electrical field into a semiconductor made of thin nickel films on a substrate of SiO2Si creates a waferscale 4 inches 100 mm wrinkletearresiduefree graphene layer at a relatively low temperature of 500 C CMOScompatible graphene Integration of graphene in the widely employed CMOS fabrication process demands its transferfree direct synthesis on dielectric substrates at temperatures below 500 C At the IEDM 2018 researchers from University of California Santa Barbara demonstrated a novel CMOScompatible graphene synthesis process at 300 C suitable for backendofline BEOL applications The process involves pressureassisted solidstate diffusion of carbon through a thinfilm of metal catalyst The synthesized largearea graphene films were shown to exhibit high quality via Raman characterization and similar resistivity values when compared with hightemperature CVD synthesized graphene films of the same crosssection down to widths of 20 nm Simulation In addition to experimental investigation of graphene and graphenebased devices numerical modeling and simulation of graphene has also been an important research topic The Kubo formula provides an analytic expression for the graphenes conductivity and shows that it is a function of several physical parameters including wavelength temperature and chemical potential Moreover a surface conductivity model which describes graphene as an infinitesimally thin twosided sheet with a local and isotropic conductivity has been proposed This model permits the derivation of analytical expressions for the electromagnetic field in the presence of a graphene sheet in terms of a dyadic Green function represented using Sommerfeld integrals and exciting electric current Even though these analytical models and methods can provide results for several canonical problems for benchmarking purposes many practical problems involving graphene such as the design of arbitrarily shaped electromagnetic devices are analytically intractable With the recent advances in the field of computational electromagnetics CEM various accurate and efficient numerical methods have become available for analysis of electromagnetic fieldwave interactions on graphene sheets andor graphenebased devices A comprehensive summary of computational tools developed for analyzing graphenebased devicessystems is proposed Graphene analogs Graphene analogs also referred to as artificial graphene are twodimensional systems which exhibit similar properties to graphene Graphene analogs have been studied intensively since the discovery of graphene in 2004 People try to develop systems in which the physics is easier to observe and manipulate than in graphene In those systems electrons are not always the particles that are used They might be optical photons microwave photons plasmons microcavity polaritons or even atoms Also the honeycomb structure in which those particles evolve can be of a different nature than carbon atoms in graphene It can be respectively a photonic crystal an array of metallic rods metallic nanoparticles a lattice of coupled microcavities or an optical lattice Applications Graphene is a transparent and flexible conductor that holds great promise for various materialdevice applications including solar cells lightemitting diodes LED integrated photonic circuit devices touch panels and smart windows or phones Smartphone products with graphene touch screens are already on the market In 2013 Head announced their new range of graphene tennis racquets As of 2015 there is one product available for commercial use a grapheneinfused printer powder Many other uses for graphene have been proposed or are under development in areas including electronics biological engineering filtration lightweightstrong composite materials photovoltaics and energy storage Graphene is often produced as a powder and as a dispersion in a polymer matrix This dispersion is supposedly suitable for advanced composites paints and coatings lubricants oils and functional fluids capacitors and batteries thermal management

graphene as the first of both a streetlegal track car and a production car In January 2018 graphenebased spiral inductors exploiting kinetic inductance at room temperature were first demonstrated at the University of California Santa Barbara led by Kaustav Banerjee These inductors were predicted to allow significant miniaturization in radiofrequency integrated circuit applications The potential of epitaxial graphene on SiC for metrology has been shown since 2010 displaying quantum Hall resistance quantization accuracy of three parts per billion in monolayer epitaxial graphene Over the years precisions of partspertrillion in the Hall resistance quantization and giant quantum Hall plateaus have been demonstrated Developments in the encapsulation and doping of epitaxial graphene have led to the commercialization of epitaxial graphene quantum resistance standards Novel uses for graphene continue to be researched and explored One such use is in combination with waterbased epoxy resins to produce anticorrosive coatings The van der Waals nature of graphene and other twodimensional 2D materials also permits van der Waals heterostructures and integrated circuits based on Van der Waals integration of 2D materials Graphene is utilized in detecting gasses and chemicals in environmental monitoring developing highly sensitive biosensors for medical diagnostics and creating flexible wearable sensors for health monitoring Graphenes transparency also enhances optical sensors making them more effective in imaging and spectroscopy Toxicity One review on graphene toxicity published in 2016 by Lalwani et al summarizes the in vitro in vivo antimicrobial and environmental effects and highlights the various mechanisms of graphene toxicity Another review published in 2016 by Ou et al focused on graphenefamily nanomaterials GFNs and revealed several typical mechanisms such as physical destruction oxidative stress DNA damage inflammatory response apoptosis autophagy and necrosis A 2020 study showed that the toxicity of graphene is dependent on several factors such as shape size purity postproduction processing steps oxidative state functional groups dispersion state synthesis methods route and dose of administration and exposure times In 2014 research at Stony Brook University showed that graphene nanoribbons graphene nanoplatelets and graphene nanoonions are nontoxic at concentrations up to 50 gml These nanoparticles do not alter the differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells towards osteoblasts bone or adipocytes fat suggesting that at low doses graphene nanoparticles are safe for biomedical applications In 2013 research at Brown University found that 10 m fewlayered graphene flakes can pierce cell membranes in solution They were observed to enter initially via sharp and jagged points allowing graphene to be internalized in the cell The physiological effects of this remain unknown and this remains a relatively unexplored field See also

    title: "Circular economy",
    originalContent:
      "A circular economy also referred to as circularity or CE is a model of resource production and consumption in any economy that involves sharing leasing reusing repairing refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible The concept aims to tackle global challenges such as climate change biodiversity loss waste and pollution by emphasizing the designbased implementation of the three base principles of the model The main three principles required for the transformation to a circular economy are designing out waste and pollution keeping products and materials in use and regenerating natural systems CE is defined in contradistinction to the traditional linear economy The idea and concepts of a circular economy have been studied extensively in academia business and government over the past ten years It has been gaining popularity because it can help to minimize carbon emissions and the consumption of raw materials open up new market prospects and principally increase the sustainability of consumption At a government level a circular economy is viewed as a method of combating global warming as well as a facilitator of longterm growth CE may geographically connect actors and resources to stop material loops at the regional level In its core principle the European Parliament defines CE as a model of production and consumption that involves sharing leasing reusing repairing refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible In this way the life cycle of products is extended Global implementation of circular economy can reduce global emissions by 228 billion tons 39 of global emissions in the year 2019 By implementing circular economy strategies in five sectors alone cement aluminum steel plastics and food 93 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent equal to all current emissions from transportation can be reducedIn a circular economy business models play a crucial role in enabling the shift from linear to circular processes Various business models have been identified that support circularity including productasaservice sharing platforms and product life extension models among others These models aim to optimize resource utilization reduce waste and create value for businesses and customers alike while contributing to the overall goals of the circular economy Businesses can also make the transition to the circular economy where holistic adaptations in firms business models are needed The implementation of circular economy principles often requires new visions and strategies and a fundamental redesign of product concepts service offerings and channels towards longlife solutions resulting in the socalled circular business models Definition There are many definitions of the circular economy For example in China CE is promoted as a topdown national political objective meanwhile in other areas such as the European Union Japan and the USA it is a tool to design bottomup environmental and waste management policies The ultimate goal of promoting CE is the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth A comprehensive definition could be Circular economy is an economic system that targets zero waste and pollution throughout materials lifecycles from environment extraction to industrial transformation and final consumers applying to all involved ecosystems Upon its lifetime end materials return to either an industrial process or in the case of a treated organic residual safely back to the environment as in a natural regenerating cycle It operates by creating value at the macro meso and micro levels and exploiting to the fullest the sustainability nested concept Used energy sources are clean and renewable Resource use and consumption are efficient Government agencies and responsible consumers play an active role in ensuring the correct system longterm operationMore generally circular development is a model of economic social and environmental production and consumption that aims to build an autonomous and sustainable society in tune with the issue of environmental resources The circular economy aims to transform our economy into one that is regenerative An economy that innovates to reduce waste and the ecological and environmental impact of industries prior to happening rather than waiting to address the consequences of these issues This is done by designing new processes and solutions for the optimization of resources decoupling reliance on finite resources The circular economy is a framework of three principles driven by design eliminating waste and pollution keeping products and materials in use and regenerating natural systems It is based increasingly on renewable energy and materials and it is accelerated by digital innovation It is a resilient distributed diverse and inclusive economic model The circular economy is an economic concept often linked to sustainable development provision of the Sustainable Development Goals Global Development Goals and an extension of a green economy Other definitions and precise thresholds that separate linear from circular activity have also been developed in the economic literature In a linear economy natural resources are turned into products that are ultimately destined to become waste because of the way they have been designed and manufactured This process is often summarized as take make waste By contrast a circular economy aims to transition from a takemakewaste approach to a more restorative and regenerative system It employs reuse sharing repair refurbishment remanufacturing and recycling to create a closedloop system reducing the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste pollution and carbon emissions The circular economy aims to keep products materials equipment and infrastructure in use for longer thus improving the productivity of these resources Waste materials and energy should become input for other processes through waste valorization either as a component for another industrial process or as regenerative resources for nature eg compost The Ellen MacArthur Foundation EMF defines the circular economy as an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by value and design Circular economy strategies can be applied at various scales from individual products and services to entire industries and cities For example industrial symbiosis is a strategy where waste from one industry becomes an input for another creating a network of resource exchange and reducing waste pollution and resource consumption Similarly circular cities aim to integrate circular principles into urban planning and development foster local resource loops and promote sustainable lifestyles among their citizens Less than 10 of economic activity worldwide in 2022 and 2023 is circular Every year the global population uses approximately 100 billion tonnes of materials with more than 90 of them being wasted The circular economy seeks to address this by eliminating waste entirely History and aims The concept of a circular economy cannot be traced back to one single date or author rather to different schools of thought The concept of a circular economy can be linked to various schools of thought including industrial ecology biomimicry and cradletocradle design principles Industrial ecology is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems which forms the basis of the circular economy Biomimicry involves emulating natures timetested patterns and strategies in designing human systems Cradletocradle design is a holistic approach to designing products and systems that considers their entire life cycle from raw material extraction to endoflife disposal and seeks to minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency These interrelated concepts contribute to the development and implementation of the circular economy General systems theory founded by the biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy considers growth and energy for open and closed state systems This theory was then applied to other areas such as in the case of the circular economy economics Economist Kenneth E Boulding in his paper The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth argued that a circular economic system is a prerequisite for the maintenance of the sustainability of human life on Earth Boulding describes the socalled cowboy economy as an open system in which the natural environment is typically perceived as limitless no limit exists on the capacity of the outside to supply or receive energy and material flows Walter R Stahel and Genevive RedayMulvey in their book The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy lay the foundation for the principles of the circular economy by describing how increasing labour may reduce energy intensive activities Simple economic models have ignored the economyenvironment interrelationships Allan Kneese in The Economics of Natural Resources indicates how resources are not endlessly renewable and mentions the term circular economy for the first time explicitly in 1988 In their book Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment Pearce and Turner explain the shift from the traditional linear or openended economic system to the circular economic system Pearce and Turner 1990 They describe an economic system where waste at extraction production and consumption stages is turned into inputs In the early 2000s China integrated the notion into its industrial and environmental policies to make them resourceoriented productionoriented wasteoriented useoriented and life cycleoriented The Ellen MacArthur Foundation was instrumental in the diffusion of the concept in Europe and the Americas In 2010 the concept of circular economy started to become popular internationally after the publication of several reports The European Union introduced its vision of the circular economy in 2014 with a New Circular Economy Action Plan launched in 2020 that shows the way to a climateneutral competitive economy of empowered consumers The original diffusion of the notion benefited from three major events the explosion of raw material prices between 2000 and 2010 the Chinese control of rare earth materials and the 2008 economic crisis Today the climate emergency and environmental challenges induce companies and individuals in rethink their production and consumption patterns The circular economy is framed as one of the answers to these challenges Key macroarguments in favour of the circular economy are that it could enable economic growth that does not add to the burden on natural resource extraction but decouples resource uses from the development of economic welfare for a growing population reduces foreign dependence on critical materials lowers CO2 emissions reduces waste production and introduces new modes of production and consumption able to create further value Corporate arguments in favour of the circular economy are that it could secure the supply of raw materials reduce the price volatility of inputs and control costs reduce spills and waste extend the life cycle of products serve new segments of customers and generate longterm shareholder value A key idea behind the circular business models is to create loops throughout to recapture value that would otherwise be lost Of particular concern is the irrevocable loss of raw materials due to their increase in entropy in the linear business model Starting with the production of waste in manufacturing the entropy increases further by mixing and diluting materials in their manufacturing assembly followed by corrosion and wear and tear during the usage period At the end of the life cycle there is an exponential increase in disorder arising from the mixing of materials in landfills As a result of this directionality of the entropy law the worlds resources are effectively lost forever Circular development is directly linked to the circular economy and aims to build a sustainable society based on recyclable and renewable resources to protect society from waste and to be able to form a model that no longer considering resources as infinite This new model of economic development focuses on the production of goods and services taking into account environmental and social costs Circular development therefore supports the circular economy to create new societies in line with new waste management and sustainability objectives that meet the needs of citizens It is about enabling economies and societies in general to become more sustainable However critiques of the circular economy suggest that proponents of the circular economy may overstate the potential benefits of the circular economy These critiques put forward the idea that the circular economy has too many definitions to be delimited making it an umbrella concept that although exciting and appealing is hard to understand and assess Critiques mean that the literature ignores muchestablished knowledge In particular it neglects the thermodynamic principle that one can neither create nor destroy matter Therefore a future where waste no longer exists where material loops are closed and products are recycled indefinitely is in any practical sense impossible They point out that a lack of inclusion of indigenous discourses from the Global South means that the conversation is less ecocentric than it depicts itself There is a lack of clarity as to whether the circular economy is more sustainable than the linear economy and what its social benefits might be in particular due to diffuse contours Other issues include the increasing risks of cascading failures which are a feature of highly interdependent systems and have potential harm to the general public When implemented in bad faith touted Circular Economy activities can often be little more than reputation and impression management for public relations purposes by large corporations and other vested interests constituting a new form of greenwashing It may thus not be the panacea many had hoped for Sustainability Intuitively the circular economy would appear to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system Reducing the resources used and the waste and leakage created conserves resources and helps to reduce environmental pollution However it is argued by some that these assumptions are simplistic and that they disregard the complexity of existing systems and their potential tradeoffs For example the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the circular economy Some cases that might require different or additional strategies like purchasing new more energyefficient equipment By reviewing the literature a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft showed that there are at least eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy In addition it is important to underline the innovation aspect at the heart of sustained development based on circular economy components Scope The circular economy can have a broad scope Researchers have focused on different areas such as industrial applications with both productoriented and natural resources and services practices and policies to better understand the limitations that the CE currently faces strategic management for details of the circular economy and different outcomes such as potential reuse applications and waste management The circular economy includes products infrastructure equipment services and buildings and applies to every industry sector It includes technical resources metals minerals fossil resources and biological resources food fibres timber etc Most schools of thought advocate a shift from fossil fuels to the use of renewable energy and emphasize the role of diversity as a characteristic of resilient and sustainable systems The circular economy includes a discussion of the role of money and finance as part of the wider debate and some of its pioneers have called for a revamp of economic performance measurement tools One study points out how modularization could become a cornerstone to enabling a circular economy and enhancing the sustainability of energy infrastructure One example of a circular economy model is the implementation of renting models in traditional ownership areas eg electronics clothes furniture transportation By renting the same product to several clients manufacturers can increase revenues per unit thus decreasing the need to produce more to increase revenues Recycling initiatives are often described as circular economy and are likely to be the most widespread models According to a report of the organization Circle economy global implementation of circular economy can reduce global emissions by 228 billion tons 39 of global emissions in the year 2019 By 2050 93 billion metric tons ofCO2 equivalent or almost half of the global greenhouse gas emissions from the production of goods might be reduced by implementing circular economy strategies in only five significant industries cement aluminum steel plastics and food That would equal to eliminating all current emissions caused by transportation Background As early as 1966 Kenneth Boulding raised awareness of an open economy with unlimited input resources and output sinks in contrast with a closed economy in which resources and sinks are tied and remain as long as possible part of the economy Bouldings essay The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth is often cited as the first expression of the circular economy although Boulding does not use that phrase The circular economy is grounded in the study of feedbackrich nonlinear systems particularly living systems The contemporary understanding of the circular economy and its practical applications to economic systems has evolved incorporating different features and contributions from a variety of concepts sharing the idea of closed loops Some of the relevant theoretical influences are cradle to cradle laws of ecology eg Barry Commoner The Closing Circle looped and performance economy Walter R Stahel regenerative design industrial ecology biomimicry and blue economy see section Related concepts The circular economy was further modelled by British environmental economists David W Pearce and R Kerry Turner in 1989 In Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment they pointed out that a traditional openended economy was developed with no builtin tendency to recycle which was reflected by treating the environment as a waste reservoir In the early 1990s Tim Jackson began to create the scientific basis for this new approach to industrial production in his edited collection Clean Production Strategies including chapters from preeminent writers in the field such as Walter R Stahel Bill Rees and Robert Constanza At the time still called preventive environmental management his followon book Material Concerns Pollution Profit and Quality of Life synthesized these findings into a manifesto for change moving industrial production away from an extractive linear system towards a more circular economy Emergence of the idea In their 1976 research report to the European Commission The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy Walter Stahel and Genevieve Reday sketched the vision of an economy in loops or a circular economy and its impact on job creation economic competitiveness resource savings and waste prevention The report was published in 1982 as the book Jobs for Tomorrow The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy In 1982 Walter Stahel was awarded third prize in the Mitchell Prize competition on sustainable business models with his paper The ProductLife Factor The first prize went to the then US Secretary of Agriculture the second prize to Amory and Hunter Lovins and fourth prize to Peter Senge Considered one of the first pragmatic and credible sustainability think tanks the main goals of Stahels institute are to extend the working life of products to make goods last longer to reuse existing goods and ultimately to prevent waste This model emphasizes the importance of selling services rather than products an idea referred to as the functional service economy and sometimes put under the wider notion of performance economy This model also advocates more localization of economic activity Promoting a circular economy was identified as a national policy in Chinas 11th fiveyear plan starting in 2006 The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has more recently outlined the economic opportunity of a circular economy bringing together complementary schools of thought in an attempt to create a coherent framework thus giving the concept a wide exposure and appeal Most frequently described as a framework for thinking its supporters claim it is a coherent model that has value as part of a response to the end of the era of cheap oil and materials and moreover contributes to the transition to a lowcarbon economy In line with this a circular economy can contribute to meeting the COP 21 Paris Agreement The emissions reduction commitments made by 195 countries at the COP 21 Paris Agreement are not sufficient to limit global warming to 15 C To reach the 15 C ambition it is estimated that additional emissions reductions of 15 billion tonnes of CO2 per year need to be achieved by 2030 Circle Economy and Ecofys estimated that circular economy strategies may deliver emissions reductions that could bridge the gap by half Moving away from the linear model Linear take make dispose industrial processes and the lifestyles dependent on them use up finite reserves to create products with a finite lifespan which end up in landfills or in incinerators The circular approach by contrast takes insights from living systems It considers that our systems should work like organisms processing nutrients that can be fed back into the cyclewhether biological or technicalhence the closed loop or regenerative terms usually associated with it The generic circular economy label can be applied to or claimed by several different schools of thought but all of them gravitate around the same basic principles One prominent thinker on the topic is Walter R Stahel an architect economist and founding father of industrial sustainability Credited with having coined the expression Cradle to Cradle in contrast with Cradle to Grave illustrating our Resource to Waste way of functioning in the late 1970s Stahel worked on developing a closed loop approach to production processes cofounding the ProductLife Institute in Geneva In the UK Steve D Parker researched waste as a resource in the UK agricultural sector in 1982 developing novel closedloop production systems These systems mimicked and worked with the biological ecosystems they exploited Cradle to Cradle Circular economy often refers to quantities of recycled materials or reduced waste however Cradle to Cradle Design focuses on quality of products including safety for humans and environmental health Popularized by the book Cradle to Cradle Remaking The Way We Make Things Cradle to Cradle Design has been widely implemented by architect William McDonough who was introduced as the father of the circular economy while receiving the 2017 Fortune Award for Circular Economy Leadership in Davos during the World Economic Forum Levels of circularity R models In the 2010s several models of a circular economy were developed that employed a set of steps or levels of circularity typically using English verbs or nouns starting with the letter r The first such model known as the Three R principle was Reduce Reuse Recycle which can be traced back as early as the 1970s According to Breteler 2022 the most comprehensive and extensive of four compared models was the 10R principle developed by sustainable entrepreneurship professor and former Dutch Environment Minister Jacqueline Cramer Towards the circular economy In 2013 a report was released entitled Towards the Circular Economy Economic and Business Rationale for an Accelerated Transition The report commissioned by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and developed by McKinsey Company was the first volume of its kind to consider the economic and business opportunity for the transition to a restorative circular model Using product case studies and economywide analysis the report details the potential for significant benefits across the EU It argues that a subset of the EU manufacturing sector could realize net materials cost savings worth up to 630 billion annually towards 2025stimulating economic activity in the areas of product development remanufacturing and refurbishment Towards the Circular Economy also identified the key building blocks in making the transition to a circular economy namely in skills in circular design and production new business models skills in building cascades and reverse cycles and crosscyclecrosssector collaboration This is supported by a case study from the automotive industry highlighting the importance of integrating a circular model holistically within the entire value chain of a company taking into account the interdependencies between the product process and system level Another report by WRAP and the Green Alliance called Employment and the circular economy job creation in a more resource efficient Britain done in 2015 has examined different public policy scenarios to 2030 It estimates that with no policy change 200000 new jobs will be created reducing unemployment by 54000 A more aggressive policy scenario could create 500000 new jobs and permanently reduce unemployment by 102000 The International Labour Organization predicts that implementing a circular economy by 2030 might result in an additional 78 million jobs being created globally However other research has also found that the adoption of circular economy principles may lead to job losses in emerging economies On the other hand implementing a circular economy in the United States has been presented by Ranta et al who analyzed the institutional drivers and barriers for the circular economy in different regions worldwide by following the framework developed by Scott R In the article different worldwide environmentfriendly institutions were selected and two types of manufacturing processes were chosen for the analysis 1 a productoriented and 2 a waste management Specifically in the US the productoriented company case in the study was Dell a US manufacturing company for computer technology which was the first company to offer free recycling to customers and to launch to the market a computer made from recycling materials from a verified thirdparty source Moreover the waste management case that includes many stages such as collection disposal recycling in the study was Republic Services the secondlargest waste management company in the US The approach to defining the drivers and barriers was to first identify indicators for their cases in study and then to categorize these indicators into drivers when the indicator was in favor of the circular economy model or a barrier when it was not On 2 March 2022 in Nairobi representatives of 175 countries pledged to create a legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution by the end of the year 2024 The agreement should address the full lifecycle of plastic and propose alternatives including reusability The agreement is expected to facilitate the transition to a circular economy that will reduce GHG emissions by 25 percent according to the published statement Circular product design and standards Product designs that optimize durability ease of maintenance and repair upgradability remanufacturability separability disassembly and reassembly are considered key elements for the transition toward circularity of products Standardization can facilitate related innovative sustainable and competitive advantages for European businesses and consumers Design for standardization and compatibility would make product parts and interfaces suitable for other products and aims at multifunctionality and modularity A Product Family Approach has been proposed to establish commonality compatibility standardization or modularization among different products or product lines It has been argued that emerging technologies should be designed with circular economy principles from the start including solar panels Design of circularity processes For sustainability and health the circularity process designs may be of crucial importance Large amounts of electronic waste are already recycled but far from where they were consumed with often low efficiency and with substantial negative effects on human health and the foreign environment Recycling should therefore reduce environmental impacts of the overall productservice provision system assessed based on the lifecycle assessment approach One study suggests that a mandatory certification scheme for recyclers of electronic waste in or out of Europe would help to incentivize highquality treatment processes and efficient material recovery Digitalization may enable more efficient corporate processes and minimize waste Circular business models While the initial focus of the academic industry and policy activities was mainly focused on the development of reX recycling remanufacturing reuse etc technology it soon became clear that the technological capabilities increasingly exceed their implementation To leverage this technology for the transition toward a circular economy various stakeholders have to work together This shifted attention towards businessmodel innovation as a key leverage for circular technology adaption Rheaply a platform that aims to scale reuse within and between organizations is an example of a technology that focuses on asset management disposition to support organizations transitioning to circular business modelsCircular business models can be defined as business models that are closing narrowing slowing intensifying and dematerializing loops to minimize the resource inputs into and the waste and emission leakage out of the organizational system This comprises recycling measures closing efficiency improvements narrowing use phase extensions slowing a more intense use phase intensifying and the substitution of products by service and software solutions dematerializing These strategies can be achieved through the purposeful design of material recovery processes and related circular supply chains As illustrated in the Figure these five approaches to resource loops can also be seen as generic strategies or archetypes of circular business model innovation The development of circular products circular business models and more generally the circular economy is conditioned upon the affordances of the materials involved that is the enablement and constraints afforded by these materials to someone engaging with them for circular purposes Circular business models as the economic model more broadly can have different emphases and various objectives for example extend the life of materials and products where possible over multiple use cycles use a waste food approach to help recover materials and ensure those biological materials returned to earth are benign not toxic retain the embedded energy water and other process inputs in the product and the material for as long as possible Use systemsthinking approaches in designing solutions regenerate or at least conserve nature and living systems push for policies taxes and market mechanisms that encourage product stewardship for example polluter pays regulations Circular business models are enabled by circular supply chains In practice collaboration for circular supply chains can enable the creation transfer andor capture of value stemming from circular business solutions Collaboration in supply chains can extend to downstream and upstream partners and include existing and new collaboration Similarly circular supply chain collaboration allows innovation into the circular business model focusing on its processes products or services Digital circular economy Building on circular business model innovation digitalization and digital technologies eg internet of things big data artificial intelligence blockchain are seen as a key enabler for upscaling the circular economy Also referred to as the data economy the central role of digital technologies for accelerating the circular economy transition is emphasized within the Circular Economy Action Plan of the European Green deal The smart circular economy framework illustrates this by establishing a link between digital technologies and sustainable resource management This allows assessment of different digital circular economy strategies with their associated level of maturity providing guidance on how to leverage data and analytics to maximize circularity ie optimizing functionality and resource intensity Supporting this a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for circular economy was published in the framework of the Horizon 2020 project CICERONE that puts digital technologies at the core of many key innovation fields waste management industrial symbiosis products traceability Some researchers have emphasised a need to comply with several requirements for implementing blockchain technology in order to make circular economy a reality Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy PACE In 2018 the World Economic Forum World Resources Institute Philips Ellen MacArthur Foundation United Nations Environment Programme and over 40 other partners launched the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy PACE PACE follows on the legacy of WEFs CEOled initiative Project MainStream which sought to scale up circular economy innovations PACEs original intent has three focal areas developing models of blended finance for circular economy projects especially in developing and emerging economies creating policy frameworks to address specific barriers to advancing the circular economy and promoting publicprivate partnership for these purposes In 2020 PACE released a report with partner Circle Economy claiming that the world is 86 circular claiming all countries are developing countries given the unsustainable levels of consumption in countries with higher levels of human development PACE is a coalition of CEOs and Ministersincluding the leaders of global corporations like IKEA CocaCola Alphabet Inc and DSM governmental partners and development institutions from Denmark The Netherlands Finland Rwanda UAE China and beyond Initiatives currently managed under PACE include the Capital Equipment Coalition with Philips and numerous other partners and the Global Battery Alliance with over 70 partners In January 2019 PACE released a report entitled A New Circular Vision for Electronics Time for a Global Reboot in support of the United Nations Ewaste Coalition The coalition is hosted by a Secretariat headed by David B McGinty former leader of the Human Development Innovation Fund and Palladium International and board member of BoardSource Board Members include Inger Andersen Frans van Houten Ellen MacArthur Lisa P Jackson and Stientje van Veldhoven Circular economy standard BS 80012017 To provide authoritative guidance to organizations implementing circular economy CE strategies in 2017 the British Standards Institution BSI developed and launched the first circular economy standard BS 80012017 Framework for implementing the principles of the circular economy in organizations The circular economy standard BS 80012017 tries to align the farreaching ambitions of the CE with established business routines at the organizational level It contains a comprehensive list of CE terms and definitions describes the core CE principles and presents a flexible management framework for implementing CE strategies in organizations Little concrete guidance on circular economy monitoring and assessment is given however as there is no consensus yet on a set of central circular economy performance indicators applicable to organizations and individual products Development of ISOTC 323 circular economy standard In 2018 the International Organization for Standardization ISO established a technical committee TC 323 in the field of circular economy to develop frameworks guidance supporting tools and requirements for the implementation of activities of all involved organizations to maximize the contribution to Sustainable Development Four new ISO standards are under development and in the direct responsibility of the committee consisting of 70 participating members and 11 observing members Strategic management in a circular economy The CE does not aim at changing the profit maximization paradigm of businesses Rather it suggests an alternative way of thinking how to attain a sustained competitive advantage SCA while concurrently addressing the environmental and socioeconomic concerns of the 21st century Indeed stepping away from linear forms of production most often leads to the development of new core competencies along the value chain and ultimately superior performance that cuts costs improves efficiency promote brand names mitigate risks develop new products and meets advanced government regulations and the expectations of green consumers But despite the multiple examples of companies successfully embracing circular solutions across industries and notwithstanding the wealth of opportunities that exist when a firm has clarity over what circular actions fit its unique profile and goals CE decisionmaking remains a highly complex exercise with no onesizefitsall solution The intricacy and fuzziness of the topic is still felt by most companies especially SMEs which perceive circular strategies as something not applicable to them or too costly and risky to implement This concern is today confirmed by the results of ongoing monitoring studies like the Circular Readiness Assessment Strategic management is the field of management that comes to the rescue allowing companies to carefully evaluate CEinspired ideas but also to take a firm apart and investigate ifhowwhere seeds of circularity can be found or implanted Prior research has identified strategic development for circularity to be a challenging process for companies demanding multiple iterative strategic cycles The book Strategic Management and the Circular Economy defined for the first time a CE strategic decisionmaking process covering the phases of analysis formulation and planning Each phase is supported by frameworks and concepts popular in management consultinglike idea tree value chain VRIE Porters five forces PEST SWOT strategic clock or the internationalization matrixall adapted through a CE lens hence revealing new sets of questions and considerations Although yet to be verified it is argued that all standard tools for strategic management can and should be calibrated and applied to a CE A specific argument has already been made for the strategy direction matrix of product vs market and the 3 3 GEMcKinsey matrix to assess business strength vs industry attractiveness the BCG matrix of market share vs industry growth rate and Kraljics portfolio matrix Engineering the Circular Life cycle The engineering lifecycle is a wellestablished approach in the design and systems engineering of complex and certified systems It refers to the series of stages that a complex engineered product passes through from initial concept and design through production use and endoflife management The approach is commonly used in heavy manufacturing and heavily regulated industries for example aviation Complex and certified engineering systems however include many of the smaller products encountered on a daily basis for example bicycles and household appliances Implementing the principles of circularity requires all engineering design teams to take a lifecycle approach to the product The Circular Lifecycle for Complex Engineering Systems Building on both the engineering lifecycle and the principles of the circular economy the Circular Lifecycle for Complex Engineering Systems newly established framework Circular Lifecycle for Complex Engineering Systems forms the core of this approach This framework advocates for a reassessment of recognized engineering disciplines with an emphasis on integrating less familiar circular principles It particularly focuses on designing to meet user needs the application of established engineering disciplines to achieve product longevity engineering for the transition to renewable energy sources and maximizing value generation from waste As with the traditional engineering lifecycle this approach can be applied to all engineering systems with the depth of activity tailored depending on the complexity of the product and can incorporate multiple inter requiring planning substantial resource consumption and prolonged service lifetimes LifecycleValue Stream Matrix The key to implementing the circular lifecycle for complex engineering systems is ensuring the engineering design team have a solid understanding of the products ecosystem The LifecycleValue Stream Matrix for complex and certified circular systems assists engineers and product design teams in visualizing the products ecosystem more effectively It enables engineers to map the intricate ecosystem surrounding their products leading to the identification of potential strategic partners and novel opportunities for technology and service innovation The matrix captures the value stream for various suppliers providing increasing levels of complexity in products and services It is important to note that these suppliers will change throughout the life cycle In the design phase of the complex engineering system traditionally the systemlevel suppliers would only be those suppliers who are integrating the engineering system itself Later in the life cycle the initial systemslevel suppliers will be joined by other suppliers operating at a systems level who may deliver products and services that facilitate the operation and usage of the initial engineering system Circular Engineering Lifecycle Implementation Challenges and Opportunities Adopting an engineering circular lifecycle approach undeniably brings a considerable set of challenges Complex engineering systems especially those with extended lifecycles and intricate safety and certification governance frameworks may encounter difficulties while transitioning to renewable energy sources However the circular lifecycle concept is adaptable to a broad range of manufactured and engineered products affirming its universal applicability The primary challenge within organizations will be a mindset shift and establishment of these innovative methodologies Despite these hurdles the implementation of this engineering lifecycle approach holds enormous potential for both consumers and businesses This is especially true when a collaborative throughlife service approach is applied highlighting the vast economic opportunities that can arise from embracing circularity in engineering lifecycles Adoption and applications by industry Textile industry A circular economy within the textiles industry refers to the practice of clothes and fibers continually being recycled to reenter the economy as much as possible rather than ending up as waste A circular textile economy is in response to the current linear model of the fashion industry in which raw materials are extracted manufactured into commercial goods and then bought used and eventually discarded by consumers Business of Fashion 2017 Fast fashion companies have fueled the high rates of consumption which further magnify the issues of a linear system The takemakedispose model not only leads to an economic value loss of over 500 billion per year but also has numerous negative environmental and societal impacts Business of Fashion 2018 Such environmental effects include tons of clothing ending up in landfills and incineration while the societal effects put human rights at risk A documentary about the world of fashion The True Cost 2015 explained that in fast fashion wages unsafe conditions and factory disasters are all excused because of the needed jobs they create for people with no alternatives This shows that fast fashion is harming the planet in more ways than one by running on a linear system It is argued that by following a circular economy the textile industry can be transformed into a sustainable business A 2017 report A New Textiles Economy stated the four key ambitions needed to establish a circular economy phasing out substances of concern and microfiber release transforming the way clothes are designed sold and used to break free from their increasingly disposable nature radically improving recycling by transforming clothing design collection and reprocessing and making effective use of resources and moving to renewable input While it may sound like a simple task only a handful of designers in the fashion industry have taken charge including Patagonia Eileen Fisher Nathalia JMag and Stella McCartney An example of a circular economy within a fashion brand is Eileen Fishers Tiny Factory in which customers are encouraged to bring their worn clothing to be manufactured and resold In a 2018 interview Fisher explained A big part of the problem with fashion is overconsumption We need to make less and sell less You get to use your creativity but you also get to sell more but not create more stuff Circular initiatives such as clothing rental startups are also getting more and more highlight in the EU and in the US as well Operating with circular business model rental services offer everyday fashion baby wear maternity wear for rent The companies either offer flexible pricing in a pay as you rent model like Palanta does or offer fixed monthly subscriptions such as Rent The Runway or Le Tote Both China and Europe have taken the lead in pushing a circular economy McDowall et al 2017 stated that the Chinese perspective on the circular economy is broad incorporating pollution and other issues alongside waste and resource concerns while Europes conception of the circular economy has a narrower environmental scope focusing on waste and resources and opportunities for business Construction industry The construction sector is one of the worlds largest waste generators The circular economy appears as a helpful solution to diminish the environmental impact of the industry Construction is very important to the economy of the European Union and its state members It provides 18 million direct jobs and contributes to about 9 of the EUs GDP The main causes of the constructions environmental impact are found in the consumption of nonrenewable resources and the generation of contaminant residues both of which are increasing at an accelerating pace In the European Union alone people and companies generate more than 2 billion tonnes of garbage year or 48 tonnes per person mostly from the building mining and manufacturing sectors Each individual in Europe generates half a tonne of municipal garbage annually less than half of which gets recycled Cement production accounts for 24 of worldwide CO2 emissions from industrial and energy sources Decision making about the circular economy can be performed on the operational connected with particular parts of the production process tactical connected with whole processes and strategic connected with the whole organization levels It may concern both construction companies as well as construction projects where a construction company is one of the stakeholders Endoflife buildings can be deconstructed hereby creating new construction elements that can be used for creating new buildings and freeing up space for new development Modular construction systems can be useful to create new buildings in the future and have the advantage of allowing easier deconstruction and reuse of the components afterwards endoflife buildings Another example that fits the idea of circular economy in the construction sector on the operational level there can be pointed walnut husks that belong to hard light and natural abrasives used for example in cleaning brick surfaces Abrasive grains are produced from crushed cleaned and selected walnut shells They are classified as reusable abrasives A first attempt to measure the success of circular economy implementation was done in a construction company The circular economy can contribute to creating new posts and economic growth According to Gorecki one of such posts may be the Circular economy manager employed for construction projects Automotive industry The circular economy is beginning to catch on inside the automotive industry A case study within the heavyduty and offroad industry analyses the implementation of circular practices into a lean manufacturing context the currently dominant production strategy in automotive Lean has continuously shown to increase efficiency by eliminating waste and focusing on customer value contributing to ecoefficiency by narrowing resource loops However other measures are needed to slow down and close the resource loops altogether and reach ecoeffectiveness The study finds significant potentials by combining the lean and the circular approach to not only focus on the product and process levels ecoefficiency but also on the system perspective ecoeffectiveness There are also incentives for carmakers to do so as a 2016 report by Accenture stated that the circular economy could redefine competitiveness in the automotive sector in terms of price quality and convenience and could double revenue by 2030 and lower the cost base by up to fourteen percent So far it has typically translated itself into using parts made from recycled materials remanufacturing of car parts and looking at the design of new cars Remanufacturing is currently limited to provide spare parts where a common use is remanufacturing gearboxes which has the potential of reducing the global warming potential CO2eq by 36 compared to a newly manufactured one With the vehicle recycling industry in the EU only being able to recycle just 75 of the vehicle meaning 25 is not recycled and may end up in landfills there is much to improve here In the electric vehicle industry disassembly robots are used to help disassemble the vehicle In the EUs ETNDemeter project European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of RareEarth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles they are looking at the sustainable design issue They are for example making designs of electric motors of which the magnets can be easily removed for recycling the rare earth metals Some car manufacturers such as Volvo are also looking at alternative ownership models leasing from the automotive company Care by Volvo Logistics industry The logistics industry plays an important role in the Dutch economy because the Netherlands is located in a specific area where the transit of commodities takes place on a daily basis The Netherlands is an example of a country from the EU that has increasingly moved towards incorporating a circular economy given the vulnerability of the Dutch economy as well as other EU countries to be highly dependable on raw materials imports from countries such as China which makes the country susceptible to the unpredictable importation costs for such primary goods Research related to the Dutch industry shows that 25 of the Dutch companies are knowledgeable and interested in a circular economy furthermore this number increases to 57 for companies with more than 500 employees Some of the areas are chemical industries wholesale trade industry and agriculture forestry and fisheries because they see a potential reduction of costs when reusing recycling and reducing raw materials imports In addition logistic companies can enable a connection to a circular economy by providing customers incentives to reduce costs through shipment and route optimization as well as offering services such as prepaid shipping labels smart packaging and takeback options The shift from linear flows of packaging to circular flows as encouraged by the circular economy is critical for the sustainable performance and reputation of the packaging industry The governmentwide program for a circular economy is aimed at developing a circular economy in the Netherlands by 2050 Several statistics have indicated that there will be an increase in freight transport worldwide which will affect the environmental impacts of the global warming potential causing a challenge to the logistics industry However the Dutch council for the Environment and Infrastructure Dutch acronym Rli provided a new framework in which it suggests that the logistics industry can provide other ways to add value to the different activities in the Dutch economy Examples of adding value in innovative ways to the Dutch economy are an exchange of resources either waste or water flows for production from different industries and changing the transit port to a transit hub concept The Rli studied the role of the potentials of the logistics industry for three sectors agriculture and food chemical industries and high tech industries Agriculture There has been widespread adoption of circular economic models in agriculture which is essential to global food security and to help mitigate against climate change however there are also potential risks to human and environmental health from contaminants remaining in recycled water or organic material These risks can be mitigated by addressing three specific issues that will also depend on the local context These are contaminant monitoring collection transport and treatment and regulation and policy The Netherlands aiming to have a completely circular economy by 2050 intends a shift to circular agriculture as part of this plan This shift plans on having a sustainable and strong agriculture by as early as 2030 Changes in the Dutch laws and regulations will be introduced Some key points in this plant include closing the foddermanure cycle reusing as much waste streams as possible a team Reststromen will be appointed reducing the use of artificial fertilizers in favor of natural manure providing the chance for farms within experimentation areas to deviate from law and regulations implementing uniform methods to measure the soil quality providing the opportunity to agricultural entrepreneurs to sign an agreement with the Staatsbosbeheer State forest management to have it use the lands they lease for natuurinclusieve landbouw natureinclusive management providing initiatives to increase the earnings of farmers Furniture industry When it comes to the furniture industry most of the products are passive durable products and accordingly implementing strategies and business models that extend the lifetime of the products like repairing and remanufacturing would usually have lower environmental impacts and lower costs Companies such as GGMS are supporting a circular approach to furniture by refurbishing and reupholstering items for reuse The EU has seen a huge potential for implementing a circular economy in the furniture sector Currently out of 10000000 tonnes of annually discarded furniture in the EU most of it ends up in landfills or is incinerated There is a potential increase of 49 billion in Gross Value Added by switching to a circular model by 2030 and 163300 jobs could be created A study about the status of Danish furniture companies efforts on a circular economy states that 44 of the companies included maintenance in their business models 22 had takeback schemes and 56 designed furniture for recycling The authors of the study concluded that although a circular furniture economy in Denmark is gaining momentum furniture companies lack knowledge on how to effectively transition and the need to change the business model could be another barrier Another report in the UK saw a huge potential for reuse and recycling in the furniture sector The study concluded that around 42 of the bulk waste sent to landfills annually 16 million tonnes is furniture They also found that 80 of the raw material in the production phase is waste Oil and gas industry Between 2020 and about 2050 the oil and gas sector will have to decommission 600 installations in the UK alone Over the next decade around 840000 tonnes of materials will have to be recovered at an estimated cost of 25Bn In 2017 North Sea oil and gas decommissioning became a net drain on the public purse With UK taxpayers covering 5070 of the bill discussion of the most economic social and environmentally beneficial decommissioning solutions for the general public may lead to financial benefits Organizations such as Zero Waste Scotland have conducted studies to identify areas with reuse potential allowing equipment to continue life in other industries or to be redeployed for oil and gas Renewable energy industry Oil and gas energy resources are incompatible with the idea of a circular economy since they are defined as development that meets the needs of the present while compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs A sustainable circular economy can only be powered by renewable energies such as wind solar hydropower and geothermal What gives entities the ability to achieve net zero carbonemissions is that they can offset their fossil fuel consumption by removing carbon from the atmosphere While this is a necessary first step global smart grid technologist Steve Hoy believes that in order to create a circular economy we should adapt the concept of True Zero as opposed to net zero which is eliminating fossil fuel consumption entirely so that all energy is produced from renewable sources Current growth projections in the renewable energy industry expect a significant amount of energy and raw materials to manufacture and maintain these renewable systems Due to the emissions attributed to fossilfuel electricity generation the overall carbon footprint of renewable energy technologies is significantly lower than for fossilfuel generation over the respective systems lifespan However there are still linear trajectories when establishing renewable energy systems that should be assessed in order to fully transition to a circular economy Education industry In 2018 The Ellen MacArthur Foundation identified 138 institutions with circular economy course offerings Since then the theme of CE topics in teaching has been incorporated at a steadily increasing pace with plans for adoption at university city and country wide levels Zero Waste Scotland is an example of a country wide program that plans to implement CE into the Scottish education system through the YES Circular Economy Challenge which advocates that every learning environment should have a wholeenvironment approach to learning for sustainability that is robust demonstrable evaluated and supported by leadership at all levels A 2021 report by the EMF compares London and New York CE course offerings and finds that there is not a wholeenvironment representation when it comes to different CE topics with an element of the technical CE cycle being covered in 90 and element of the biological cycle covered in 50 of the 80 analyzed circular economy courses The EMF looks critically at the distribution of CE courses and researchers at Utrecht University Julian Kirchherr and Laura Piscicelli analyze the success of their introductory CE course in Towards an Education for the Circular Economy ECE Five Teaching Principles and a Case Study With 114 published definitions for the Circular Economy synthesis and collaboration previously exemplified could benefit and popularize CE application in higher education Plastic waste management Laws related to recyclability waste management domestic materials recovery facilities product composition biodegradability and prevention of importexport of specific wastes may support prevention of plastic pollution A study considers producermanufacturer responsibility a practical approach toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution suggesting that Existing and adopted policies legislations regulations and initiatives at global regional and national level play a vital role Standardization of products especially of packaging which are as of 2022 often composed of different materials each and across products that are hard or currently impossible to either separate or recycle together in general or in an automated way could support recyclability and recycling For instance there are systems that can theoretically distinguish between and sort 12 types of plastics such as PET using hyperspectral imaging and algorithms developed via machine learning while only an estimated 9 of the estimated 63 billion tonnes of plastic waste from the 1950s up to 2018 has been recycled 12 has been incinerated and the rest reportedly being dumped in landfills or the natural environment Rareearth elements recovery The rareearth elements REEs are vital to modern technologies and society and are amongst the most critical elements Despite this typically only around 1 of REEs are recycled from endproducts Recycling and reusing REEs is not easy these elements are mostly present in tiny amounts in small electronic parts and they are difficult to separate chemically For example recovery of neodymium requires manual disassembly of hard disk drives because shredding the drives only recovers 10 of the REE REE recycling and reuse have been increasingly focused on in recent years The main concerns include environmental pollution during REE recycling and increasing recycling efficiency Literature published in 2004 suggests that along with previously established pollution mitigation a more circular supply chain would help mitigate some of the pollution at the extraction point This means recycling and reusing REEs that are already in use or reaching the end of their life cycle A study published in 2014 suggests a method to recycle REEs from waste nickelmetal hydride batteries demonstrating a recovery rate of 9516 Rareearth elements could also be recovered from industrial wastes with practical potential to reduce environmental and health impacts from mining waste generation and imports if known and experimental processes are scaled up A study suggests that fulfillment of the circular economy approach could reduce up to 200 times the impact in the climate change category and up to 70 times the cost due to the REE mining In most of the reported studies reviewed by a scientific review secondary waste is subjected to chemical and or bioleaching followed by solvent extraction processes for clean separation of REEs Currently people take two essential resources into consideration for the secure supply of REEs one is to extract REEs from primary resources like mines harboring REEbearing ores regolithhosted clay deposits ocean bed sediments coal fly ash etc A work developed a green system for recovery of REEs from coal fly ash by using citrate and oxalate who are strong organic ligand and capable of complexing or precipItating with REE The other one is from secondary resources such as electronic industrial waste and municipal waste Ewaste contains a significant concentration of REEs and thus is the primary option for REE recycling now According to a study approximately 50 million metric tons of electronic waste are dumped in landfills worldwide each year Despite the fact that ewaste contains a significant amount of rareearth elements REE only 125 of ewaste is currently being recycled for all metals One study suggests that by 2050 up to 40 to 75 of the EUs clean energy metal needs could come from local recycling A study estimates losses of 61 metals showing that use spans of often scarce techcritical metals are short A study using Project Drawdowns modeling framework indicates that even without considering costs or bottlenecks of expansion of renewable energy generation metal recycling can lead to significant climate change mitigation Chemistry Researchers have developed recyclingroutes for 200 industrial waste chemicals into important drugs and agrochemicals for productive reuse that reduces disposal costs and hazards to the environment A study has called for new molecules and materials for products with openenvironmental applications such as pesticides that can be neither circulated nor recycled and provides a set of guidelines on how to integrate chemistry into a circular economy Circular developments around the world Overview Already since 2006 the European Union has been concerned about environmental transition issues by translating this into directives and regulations Three important laws can be mentioned in this regard The Ecodesign Framework Directive The Waste Framework Directive The Registration Evaluation Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation On 17 December 2012 the European Commission published a document entitled Manifesto for a Resource Efficient Europe In July 2014 a zerowaste program for Europe has been put in place aiming at the circular economy Since then several documents on this subject have been published The following table summarizes the various European reports and legislation on the circular economy that have been developed between 2014 and 2018 In addition to the above legislation the EU has amended the Ecodesign Working Plan to add circularity criteria and has enacted ecodesign regulations with circular economy components for 7 product types refrigerators dishwashers electronic displays washing machines welding equipment and servers and data storage products These ecodesign regulations are aimed at increasing the reparability of products by improving the availability of spare parts and manuals At the same time the European research budget related to the circular economy has increased considerably in the last few years it has reached 964 million euros between 2018 and 2020 In total the European Union has invested 10 billion euros on Circular Economy projects between 2016 and 2019 One waste atlas aggregates some data about waste management of countries and cities albeit the data is very limited The Circularity Gap Report indicates that out of all the minerals biomass fossil fuels and metals that enter the worlds economy only 86 percent are reused The European Commissions Circular Economy Action Plan has resulted in a wide range of projects with an emphasis on waste and material sustainability as well as the circularity of consumer items Despite a huge number of EU legislative measures the European Unions circularity rate was 115 in 2022 and is slowing down currently Programs The Manifesto for a Resource Efficient Europe of 2012 clearly stated that In a world with growing pressures on resources and the environment the EU has no choice but to go for the transition to a resourceefficient and ultimately regenerative circular economy Furthermore the document highlighted the importance of a systemic change in the use and recovery of resources in the economy in ensuring future jobs and competitiveness and outlined potential pathways to a circular economy in innovation and investment regulation tackling harmful subsidies increasing opportunities for new business models and setting clear targets The European environmental research and innovation policy aims at supporting the transition to a circular economy in Europe defining and driving the implementation of a transformative agenda to green the economy and the society as a whole to achieve a truly sustainable development Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the program Horizon 2020 which is also open to participation worldwide Circular economy is found to play an important role to economic growth of European Countries highlighting the crucial role of sustainability innovation and investment in nowaste initiatives to promote wealth The European Union plans for a circular economy are spearheaded by its 2018 Circular Economy Package Historically the policy debate in Brussels mainly focused on waste management which is the second half of the cycle and very little is said about the first half ecodesign To draw the attention of policymakers and other stakeholders to this loophole the Ecothis an EU campaign was launched raising awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including ecodesign as part of the circular economy package In 2020 the European Union released its Circular Economy Action Plan Closing the loop December 2015 2018 This first circular economy Action Plan consisted of 54 measures to strengthen Europes global competitiveness promote sustainable economic growth and create more jobs Among these 54 measures for example is the importance of optimizing the use of raw materials products and waste in order to create energy savings and reduce greenhouse gas emissions The main goal being in this respect to lead to the development of a framework conducive to the circular economy In addition the development of this Action Plan was also intended to enable the development of a new market for secondary raw materials Concretely here are the principal areas concerned by the Action Plan Production Consumption Waste Management Boosting markets for secondary materials Innovation investment and horizontal measures Monitoring progress The Action plan was also a way to integrate a policy framework an integration of existing policies and legal instruments It includes notably some amendments As a matter of fact the implementation of this new plan was supported by the European Economic and Social Committee EESC This support included indepth consultation Circular Economy Action Plan of 2020 This new action was adopted by the European Commission in March 2020 A total of 574 out of 751 MEPs voted in favour of the action plan It focuses on better management of resourceintensive industries waste reduction zerocarbonization and standardization of sustainable products in Europe Prior to the development of this new action plan we can also mention the Green Deal of 2019 which integrated ecological and environmental ambitions to make Europe a carbonneutral continent On 10 February 2021 the European Parliament submitted its proposals to the Circular Economic Action Plan CEAP of the commission highlighting five major areas in particular Those are the following Batteries Construction and Buildings ICT Plastics Textiles Two additional sectors on which the CEAP focuses could be added packaging food and water Countries ranking The European leaders in terms of circular economy are designated mostly by their current efforts for a shift towards circular economy but also by their objectives and the means implemented in this shift It remains difficult to precisely rank how countries score in terms of circular economy given the many principles and aspects of it and how differently one single country can score in each of these principles but some tendencies do appear in the average score when combining the principles The Netherlands the government aims to reuse 50 of all materials as far as possible by 2030 and to convert waste into reusable materials anywhere it is possible The next goal is then to make the country shift towards a 100 wastefree economy by 2050 These objectives were all set from 2016 to 2019 in a series of programs for a governmental circular economy raw materials agreements and transition agendas focusing on the five most important sectors for waste biomass and food plastics manufacturing industry construction and consumer goods Germany Germany is a leader in some aspects of circular economy like waste management and recycling France is also adding several texts and measures for a better circular economy in the country such as the roadmap for circular economy in 2018 consisting of 50 measures for a successful transition to circular economy Belgium is also a consequent actor in the field It scored second in the circular material use rate before France but after the Netherlands In the other principles of circular economy it usually scores in the top 5 Other notable countries are Italy the United Kingdom Austria Slovenia and Denmark Outside the EU countries such as Brazil China Canada the US and especially Japan are working on the shift towards it Most countries that are in the lead in the field of circular economy are European countries meaning that Europe in general is in the lead group at the moment The reasons behind this are numerous First of all circular economy is a field that is at the moment mostly advanced in the developed countries thanks to between others technology The efforts of the European Commission are also non negligible with documents such as the Commission staff working document Leading the way to a global circular economy state of play and outlook or the new action plan for circular economy in Europe being one of the main blocs of the green deal Even if Europe as a whole is a good actor in the field some European countries are still struggling to make the shift faster These countries are mostly the eastern European countries Romania Hungary Bulgaria Slovakia etc but also in some fields Portugal Greece Croatia and even Germany In 2018 the newspaper Politico made a ranking of the by then 28 European countries by making an aggregation of the seven key metrics of the commission for each country The advantage here is that it gives a general view of how countries work towards circular development and how they compare to each other but the main drawback is that as mentioned in the article the seven metrics all have equal weight and importance in Politicos calculations which is not the case in real life Indeed it is said in the same article that the countries that score the highest in CE are not necessarily the greenest according to the Environmental Performance Index For example Germany which scores 1st in the Politico ranking only scores 13th worldwide in the EPI and is behind 10 European countries China Beginning in the early 2000s China started passing a series of laws and regulations to promote the circular economy 182183 Policymakers views expanded from a focus on recycling to broad efforts to promote efficiency and closedloop flows of materials at all stages from production to distribution to consumption 182 As part of its efforts to enhance the circular economy China is attempting to decrease its reliance on mining for its mineral supply 182 Academic Jing Vivian Zhan writes that promoting the circular economy helps China to avoid the resource curse and helps to alleviate overreliance on extractive industries 182183 Calendar Europe Since 2015 there is a plan concerning the circular economy adopted by the European Commission This first plan includes 54 actions There are also 4 legislative proposals with the objective of legal change a the framework directive on waste b the directive on the landfill of waste c the directive on packaging and packaging waste d the directive on batteries and accumulators and their waste During the 2018 negotiations between the Parliament and the council different elements will be adopted in four directives These are mainly The main objectives are the following in the European framework Minimum 65 of municipal waste to be recycled by 2035 Minimum 70 of all packaging waste to be recycled by 2030 Maximum 10 of municipal waste to be landfilled by 2035 Certain types of single use plastic will be prohibited to place on market as of July 2021 Minimum 32 of the Unions gross final consumption of energy to originate from renewable sources by 2030 The main objectives are the following in the European framework Since 2020 Europes new green deal plan focuses on design and production from the perspective of the circular economy its main objective is to ensure that the European economy keeps these resources as long as possible The action plan of this circular development is mainly based on different objectives They are To make sustainable products the norm in the EU To empower consumers to choose Focusing on the most resourceintensive sectors with a high potential to contribute to the circular economy Ensure less waste Europes green deal which came into being in 2019 aims at a climateneutral circular economy For this a distinct difference between economic growth and resources will be found A circular economy reduces the pressure on natural resources and is an indispensable prerequisite for achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and halting biodiversity loss From 2019 to 2023 the European Investment Bank funded 383 billion to cofinance 132 circular economy initiatives across many industries Circular economy initiatives with a higher risk profile have secured finance through risksharing instruments and EU guarantees Benelux Belgium Since 2014 Belgium has adopted a circular strategy This is marked by 21 measures to be followed In Belgium the three Belgian regions Flanders Brussels and Wallonia have different personal objectives For Flanders a strategy called Vision 2050 has been put in place For Wallonia there is a plan following the declaration of the regional policy for Wallonia from 2019 to 2024 Since 23 January 2020 Wallonia has adopted a new strategy including three governance bodies a steering committee an intraadministration platform and an orientation committee For Brussels a plan was adopted in 2016 to develop the circular economy in its region This plan will be in place for a period of 10 years The Netherlands The Netherlands set a plan of action for circular economy in 2016 and have been doing additional efforts for a transition towards a 100 circular economy by 2050 and 50 by 2030 The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research estimates that a full shift towards Circular Economy will at the long term generate not less than 73 billion euros and 540000 new jobs in the sector The work will be developed around the five pillars mentioned above plastics biomass and food the construction sector the manufacturing industry and consumer goods The government has also put a fund in place to facilitate and accelerate the shift These funds are part of the 300 million annually spent by the government for climaterelated decisions and actions The envelope is also completed by the ministry of infrastructure which allocated 40 million for circular economyrelated actions in 2019 and 2020 Other actions such as an allocation of subsidies for enterprises that make change or invest in the field have been taken Initiatives at the subnational level are also encouraged and regions such as Groningen Friesland the Northern Netherlands etc ere taking actions to not only reduce their environmental impact but accelerate and accentuate their actions towards Circular economy Luxembourg CE is one of the major deals of the 20182023 Luxembourg government The Luxembourg added in 2019 Circular economy in their datadriven innovation strategy considering it now as a crucial field for innovation in the next years It is present in most sectors of the countrys development plan even if it is still only at the beginning of its development More initiatives are starting to emerge however to develop better in the field The 2019 Circular economy strategy Luxembourg a document testifying on the efforts made and to be made and the willingness to transform the Grand Duchy into an example in the field Holistic strategic studies such as the strategic group for circular economy Insertion of circular economy as a subject to be discussed by all the six main pillars of the third industrial revolution Creation of the Fit4Circularity program to allocate funds to innovative businesses in the field Participation in Circular economyrelated events such as Financing the circular economy 2015 at the European Investment Bank or the Circular economy hotspot 2017 Work on educational tools in the field Collaboration with municipalities at the subnational level to encourage them to become more circular The establishment of value chains for local materials such as wood and a better management of raw materials in general A cooperation between the public and the private sector The Product Circularity Data Sheet PCDS launched in 2019 by the government to study and determine the circular potential of products and materials An implementation of tools and methods such as a regulatory framework laws a financial framework financial helps and sanctions creation management and sharing of knowledge on the subject etc A coordination of the Luxembourg goals with the SDGs and the 2030 agenda United Kingdom In 2020 the UK government published its Circular Economy Package policy statement in coordination with the Welsh and Scottish governments England From 1 October 2023 certain singleuse plastic items have been placed under bans or restrictions in England Scotland In 2021 the Scottish Parliament banned single use plastics being provided by businesses In 2024 the Scottish Parliament passed the Circular Economy Scotland Act 2024 which would require the setting of targets and providing updates to the strategy to achieve those targets as frequently as 5 years or more frequently than that Wales In 2021 the Welsh Government published its Circular Economy strategy In 2023 the Senedd banned single use plastics which would require the setting of targets and providing updates to the strategy to achieve those targets as frequently as 5 years or more frequently than that Northern Ireland In 2022 the Northern Ireland Executive held a Circular Economy consultation Circular bioeconomy The bioeconomy especially the circular bioeconomy decreases dependency on natural resources by encouraging sustainable goods that generate food materials and energy using renewable biological resources such as lupins According to the European Commissions EU Science Center the circular bioeconomy produces 15 trillion in value added accounting for 11 of EU GDP The European Investment Bank invests between 6 billion and 9 billion in the bioeconomy per year The European Circular Bioeconomy Fund Eligibility requirements and core terms of reference for an equity and mezzanine debt fund were established by the European Investment Bank and the European Commission directoratesgeneral for agriculture and research and innovation As a result an investment adviser was chosen and the European Circular Bioeconomy Fund was created As of 2023 a 65 million investment from the EIB has been made The European Circular Bioeconomy Fund invests in earlystage companies with developed innovations that are searching for funds to broaden their activities and reach new markets It specifically invests in circularbioeconomy technologies biomassfeed stock production that boots agricultural productivity while lowering environmental impact biomassfeed stock technologies that result in highervalue green goods biobased chemicals and materials and biological alternatives in fields such as cosmetics Circular Carbon Economy During the 2019 COP25 in Madrid William McDonough and marine ecologist Carlos Duarte presented the Circular Carbon Economy at an event with the BBVA Foundation The Circular Carbon Economy is based on McDonoughs ideas from Carbon Is Not The Enemy and aims to serve as the framework for developing and organizing effective systems for carbon management McDonough used the Circular Carbon Economy to frame discussions at the G20 workshops in March 2020 before the frameworks formal acceptance by the G20 Leaders in November 2020 Critiques of circular economy models There is some criticism of the idea of the circular economy As Corvellec 2015 put it the circular economy privileges continued economic growth with soft antiprograms and the circular economy is far from the most radical antiprogram Corvellec 2019 raised the issue of multispecies and stresses impossibility for waste producers to dissociate themselves from their waste and emphasizes the contingent multiple and transient value of waste 217 Scatolic engagement draws on Renos analogy of waste as scats and of scats as signs for enabling interspecies communication This analogy stresses the impossibility for waste producers to dissociate themselves from their waste and emphasizes the contingent multiple and transient value of waste 217 A key tenet of a scatolic approach to waste is to consider waste as unavoidable and worthy of interest Whereas total quality sees in waste a sign of failure a scatolic understanding sees a sign of life Likewise whereas the Circular Economy analogy of a circle evokes endless perfection the analogy of scats evokes disorienting messiness A scatolic approach features waste as a lively matter open for interpretation within organizations as well as across organizational species 219 Corvellec and Stl 2019 are mildly critical of apparel manufacturing circular economy takeback systems as ways to anticipate and head off more severe waste reduction programs Apparel retailers exploit that the circular economy is evocative but still sufficiently vague to create any concrete policies LdekeFreund Gold Bocken 2019 that might hinder their freedom of action Corvellec Stl 2017 Their businesscentered qualification of takeback systems amounts to an engagement in market action as leverage to push policymakers to create or repeal particular rules as Funk and Hirschman 201733 put it 26 Research by Zink and Geyer 2017 593 questioned the circular economys engineeringcentric assumptions However proponents of the circular economy have tended to look at the world purely as an engineering system and have overlooked the economic part of the circular economy Recent research has started to question the core of the circular economynamely whether closing material and product loops do in fact prevent primary production There are other critiques of the circular economy CE For example Allwood 2014 discussed the limits of CE material circularity and questioned the desirability of the CE in a reality with growing demand Do CE secondary production activities reuse repair and remake actually reduce or instead displace primary production natural resource extraction The problem CE overlooks its untold story is how displacement is governed mainly by market forces according to McMillan et al 2012 Its the tired old narrative that the invisible hand of market forces will conspire to create full displacement of virgin material of the same kind said Zink Geyer 2017 Korhonen Nuur Feldmann and Birkie 2018 argued that the basic assumptions concerning the values societal structures cultures underlying worldviews and the paradigmatic potential of CE remain largely unexplored It is also often pointed out that there are fundamental limits to the concept which are based among other things on the laws of thermodynamics According to the second law of thermodynamics all spontaneous processes are irreversible and associated with an increase in entropy It follows that in a real implementation of the concept one would either have to deviate from the perfect reversibility in order to generate an entropy increase by generating waste which would ultimately amount to still having parts of the economy which follow a linear scheme or enormous amounts of energy would be required from which a significant part would be dissipated in order to for the total entropy to increase In its comment to concept of the circular economy the European Academies Science Advisory Council EASAC came to a similar conclusion Recovery and recycling of materials that have been dispersed through pollution waste and endoflife product disposal require energy and resources which increase in a nonlinear manner as the percentage of recycled material rises owing to the second law of thermodynamics entropy causing dispersion Recovery can never be 100 Faber et al 1987 The level of recycling that is appropriate may differ between materials In addition to this the circular economy has been criticized for lacking a strong social justice component Indeed most circular economy visions projects and policies do not address key social questions regarding how circular economy technologies and solutions will be controlled and how their benefits and costs will be distributed To respond to these limitations some academics and social movements prefer to speak of a circular society rather than a circular economy They thereby advocate for a circular society where knowledge political power wealth and resources are sustainably circulated in fundamentally democratic and redistributive manners rather than just improving resource efficiency as most circular economy proposals do Moreover it has been argued that a postgrowth approach should be adopted for the circular economy where material loops are put directly at the service of wellbeing instead of attempting to reconcile the circular economy with GDP growth For example efficiency improvements at the level of individual products could be offset by a growth in total or percapita consumption which only beyondcircularity measures like choice editing and rationing unsustainable products or emissions may be able to address Related concepts The various approaches to circular business and economic models share several common principles with other conceptual frameworks Biomimicry Janine Benyus author of Biomimicry Innovation Inspired by Nature defined biomimicry as a new discipline that studies natures best ideas and then imitates these designs and processes to solve human problems Studying a leaf to invent a better solar cell is an example I think of it as innovation inspired by nature Blue economy Initiated by former Ecover CEO and Belgian entrepreneur Gunter Pauli derived from the study of natural biological production processes the official manifesto states using the resources available the waste of one product becomes the input to create a new cash flow Cradle to cradle Created by Walter R Stahel and similar theorists in which industry adopts the reuse and servicelife extension of goods as a strategy of waste prevention regional job creation and resource efficiency in order to decouple wealth from resource consumption Industrial ecology Industrial ecology is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems Focusing on connections between operators within the industrial ecosystem this approach aims at creating closedloop processes in which waste is seen as input thus eliminating the notion of undesirable byproduct Resource recovery Resource recovery is using wastes as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated therefore reducing the need for landfill space and also extracting maximum value from waste Sound MaterialCycle Society A similar concept used in Japan Systems thinking The ability to understand how things

    title: "Organic farming",
    originalContent:
      "Organic farming also known as organic agriculture or ecological farming or biological farming is an agricultural system that emphasizes the use of naturally occurring nonsynthetic inputs such as compost manure green manure and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation companion planting and mixed cropping Biological pest control methods such as the fostering of insect predators are also encouraged Organic agriculture can be defined as an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity while with rare exceptions prohibiting synthetic pesticides antibiotics synthetic fertilizers genetically modified organisms and growth hormones It originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices Certified organic agriculture today accounts for 70 million hectares 170 million acres globally with over half of that total in Australia Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or severely limiting synthetic substances For instance naturally occurring pesticides such as garlic extract bicarbonate of soda or pyrethrin which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower are permitted while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides such as glyphosate are prohibited Synthetic substances that are allowed only in exceptional circumstances may include copper sulfate elemental sulfur and veterinary drugs Genetically modified organisms nanomaterials human sewage sludge plant growth regulators hormones and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are prohibited Broadly organic agriculture is based on the principles of health care for all living beings and the environment ecology and fairness Organic methods champion sustainability selfsufficiency autonomy and independence health animal welfare food security and food safety It is often seen as part of the solution to the impacts of climate change Organic agricultural methods are internationally regulated and legally enforced by transnational organizations such as the European Union and also by individual nations based in large part on the standards set by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements IFOAM an international umbrella organization for organic farming organizations established in 1972 with regional branches such as IFOAM Organics Europe and IFOAM Asia Since 1990 the market for organic food and other products has grown rapidly reaching 150 billion worldwide in 2022 of which more than 64 billion was earned in North America and EUR 53 billion in Europe This demand has driven a similar increase in organically managed farmland which grew by 266 percent from 2021 to 2022 As of 2022 organic farming is practiced in 188 countries and approximately 96000000 hectares 240000000 acres worldwide were farmed organically by 45 million farmers representing approximately 2 percent of total world farmland History Agriculture was practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals Artificial fertilizers were first developed during the mid19th century These early fertilizers were cheap powerful and easy to transport in bulk Similar advances occurred in chemical pesticides in the 1940s leading to the decade being referred to as the pesticide era These new agricultural techniques while beneficial in the shortterm had serious longerterm sideeffects such as soil compaction erosion and declines in overall soil fertility along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply 10 In the late 1800s and early 1900s soil biology scientists began to seek ways to remedy these side effects while still maintaining higher production In 1921 the founder and pioneer of the organic movement Albert Howard and his wife Gabrielle Howard accomplished botanists founded an Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming methods in India Among other things they brought improved implements and improved animal husbandry methods from their scientific training then by incorporating aspects of Indian traditional methods developed protocols for the rotation of crops erosion prevention techniques and the systematic use of composts and manures Stimulated by these experiences of traditional farming when Albert Howard returned to Britain in the early 1930s he began to promulgate a system of organic agriculture In 1924 Rudolf Steiner gave a series of eight lectures on agriculture with a focus on influences of the moon planets nonphysical beings and elemental forces They were held in response to a request by adherent farmers who noticed degraded soil conditions and a deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers The lectures were published in November 1924 the first English translation appeared in 1928 as The Agriculture Course In July 1939 Ehrenfried Pfeiffer the author of the standard work on biodynamic agriculture BioDynamic Farming and Gardening came to the UK at the invitation of Walter James 4th Baron Northbourne as a presenter at the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbournes farm in Kent One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement Howard attended the conference where he met Pfeiffer In the following year Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming Look to the Land in which he coined the term organic farming The Betteshanger conference has been described as the missing link between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming In 1940 Howard published his An Agricultural Testament In this book he adopted Northbournes terminology of organic farming Howards work spread widely and he became known as the father of organic farming for his work in applying scientific knowledge and principles to various traditional and natural methods 45 In the United States J I Rodale who was keenly interested both in Howards ideas and in biodynamics founded in the 1940s both a working organic farm for trials and experimentation The Rodale Institute and Rodale Inc in Emmaus Pennsylvania to teach and advocate organic methods to the wider public These became important influences on the spread of organic agriculture Further work was done by Lady Eve Balfour the Haughley Experiment in the United Kingdom and many others across the world The term ecoagriculture was coined in 1970 by Charles Walters founder of Acres Magazine to describe agriculture which does not use manmade molecules of toxic rescue chemistry effectively another name for organic agriculture Increasing environmental awareness in the general population in modern times has transformed the originally supplydriven organic movement to a demanddriven one Premium prices and some government subsidies attracted farmers In the developing world many producers farm according to traditional methods that are comparable to organic farming but not certified and that may not include the latest scientific advancements in organic agriculture In other cases farmers in the developing world have converted to modern organic methods for economic reasons Terminology The use of organic popularized by Howard and Rodale refers more narrowly to the use of organic matter derived from plant compost and animal manures to improve the humus content of soils grounded in the work of early soil scientists who developed what was then called humus farming Since the early 1940s the two camps have tended to merge Biodynamic agriculturists on the other hand used the term organic to indicate that a farm should be viewed as a living organism 1719 in the sense of the following quotation An organic farm properly speaking is not one that uses certain methods and substances and avoids others it is a farm whose structure is formed in imitation of the structure of a natural system that has the integrity the independence and the benign dependence of an organism They based their work on Steiners spirituallyoriented alternative agriculture which includes various esoteric concepts Methods Organic agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils ecosystems and people It relies on ecological processes biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects Organic agriculture combines tradition innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved Organic farming methods combine scientific knowledge of ecology and some modern technology with traditional farming practices based on naturally occurring biological processes Organic farming methods are studied in the field of agroecology While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and watersoluble synthetically purified fertilizers organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers An example of a natural pesticide is pyrethrin which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower The principal methods of organic farming include crop rotation green manures and compost biological pest control and mechanical cultivation These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity legumes are planted to fix nitrogen into the soil natural insect predators are encouraged crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil and natural materials such as potassium bicarbonate and mulches are used to control disease and weeds Genetically modified seeds and animals are excluded While organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbonbased fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers and biological pest control instead of synthetic pesticides organic farming and largescale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture For example Integrated Pest Management is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible but in conventional farming could include synthetic pesticides only as a last resort Examples of beneficial insects that are used in organic farming include ladybugs and lacewings both of which feed on aphids The use of IPM lowers the possibility of pest developing resistance to pesticides that are applied to crops Crop diversity Organic farming encourages crop diversity by promoting polyculture multiple crops in the same space Planting a variety of vegetable crops supports a wider range of beneficial insects soil microorganisms and other factors that add up to overall farm health Crop diversity helps the environment to thrive and protects species from going extinct The science of Agroecology has revealed the benefits of polyculture which is often employed in organic farming Agroecology is a scientific discipline that uses ecological theory to study design manage and evaluate agricultural systems that are productive and resourceconserving and that are also culturally sensitive socially just and economically viable Incorporating crop diversity into organic farming practices can have several benefits For instance it can help to increase soil fertility by promoting the growth of beneficial soil microorganisms It can also help to reduce pest and disease pressure by creating a more diverse and resilient agroecosystem Furthermore crop diversity can help to improve the nutritional quality of food by providing a wider range of essential nutrients Soil management Organic farming relies more heavily on the natural breakdown of organic matter than the average conventional farm using techniques like green manure and composting to replace nutrients taken from the soil by previous crops This biological process driven by microorganisms such as mycorrhiza and earthworms releases nutrients available to plants throughout the growing season Farmers use a variety of methods to improve soil fertility including crop rotation cover cropping reduced tillage and application of compost By reducing fuelintensive tillage less soil organic matter is lost to the atmosphere This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration which reduces greenhouse gases and helps reverse climate change Reducing tillage may also improve soil structure and reduce the potential for soil erosion Plants need a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish Supplying enough nitrogen and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the time when they need it most is a challenge for organic farmers Crop rotation and green manure cover crops help to provide nitrogen through legumes more precisely the family Fabaceae which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria Intercropping which is sometimes used for insect and disease control can also increase soil nutrients but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required Crop residues can be ploughed back into the soil and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen potentially aiding synchronization Organic farmers also use animal manure certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various mineral powders such as rock phosphate and green sand a naturally occurring form of potash that provides potassium In some cases pH may need to be amended Natural pH amendments include lime and sulfur but in the US some compounds such as iron sulfate aluminum sulfate magnesium sulfate and soluble boron products are allowed in organic farming 43 Mixed farms with both livestock and crops can operate as ley farms whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogenfixing forage grasses such as white clover or alfalfa and grows cash crops or cereals when fertility is established Farms without livestock stockless may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility and may rely more on external inputs such as imported manure as well as grain legumes and green manures although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested Horticultural farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs Manure is very bulky and is often not costeffective to transport more than a short distance from the source Manure for organic farms may become scarce if a sizable number of farms become organically managed Weed management Organic weed management promotes weed suppression rather than weed elimination by enhancing crop competition and phytotoxic effects on weeds Organic farmers integrate cultural biological mechanical physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides Organic standards require rotation of annual crops meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the same location without a different intervening crop Organic crop rotations frequently include weedsuppressive cover crops and crops with dissimilar life cycles to discourage weeds associated with a particular crop Research is ongoing to develop organic methods to promote the growth of natural microorganisms that suppress the growth or germination of common weeds Other cultural practices used to enhance crop competitiveness and reduce weed pressure include selection of competitive crop varieties highdensity planting tight row spacing and late planting into warm soil to encourage rapid crop germination Mechanical and physical weed control practices used on organic farms can be broadly grouped as Tillage Turning the soil between crops to incorporate crop residues and soil amendments remove existing weed growth and prepare a seedbed for planting turning soil after seeding to kill weeds including cultivation of row crops Mowing and cutting Removing top growth of weeds Flame weeding and thermal weeding Using heat to kill weeds Mulching Blocking weed emergence with organic materials plastic films or landscape fabric Some naturally sourced chemicals are allowed for herbicidal use These include certain formulations of acetic acid concentrated vinegar corn gluten meal and essential oils A few selective bioherbicides based on fungal pathogens have also been developed At this time however organic herbicides and bioherbicides play a minor role in the organic weed control toolbox Weeds can be controlled by grazing For example geese have been used successfully to weed a range of organic crops including cotton strawberries tobacco and corn reviving the practice of keeping cotton patch geese common in the southern US before the 1950s Similarly some rice farmers introduce ducks and fish to wet paddy fields to eat both weeds and insects Controlling other organisms Organisms aside from weeds that cause problems on farms include arthropods eg insects mites nematodes fungi and bacteria Practices include but are not limited to Examples of predatory beneficial insects include minute pirate bugs bigeyed bugs and to a lesser extent ladybugs which tend to fly away all of which eat a wide range of pests Lacewings are also effective but tend to fly away Praying mantis tend to move more slowly and eat less heavily Parasitoid wasps tend to be effective for their selected prey but like all small insects can be less effective outdoors because the wind controls their movement Predatory mites are effective for controlling other mites 6690 Naturally derived insecticides allowed for use on organic farms include Bacillus thuringiensis a bacterial toxin pyrethrum a chrysanthemum extract spinosad a bacterial metabolite neem a tree extract and rotenone a legume root extract Fewer than 10 of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly a 2003 survey found that only 53 of vegetable growers in California use rotenone while 17 use pyrethrum 26 These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm 92 The main criterion for organic pesticides is that they are naturally derived and some naturally derived substances have been controversial Controversial natural pesticides include rotenone copper nicotine sulfate and pyrethrums Rotenone and pyrethrum are particularly controversial because they work by attacking the nervous system like most conventional insecticides Rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and can induce symptoms resembling Parkinsons disease in mammals Although pyrethrum natural pyrethrins is more effective against insects when used with piperonyl butoxide which retards degradation of the pyrethrins organic standards generally do not permit use of the latter substance Naturally derived fungicides allowed for use on organic farms include the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus pumilus and the fungus Trichoderma harzianum These are mainly effective for diseases affecting roots Compost tea contains a mix of beneficial microbes which may attack or outcompete certain plant pathogens but variability among formulations and preparation methods may contribute to inconsistent results or even dangerous growth of toxic microbes in compost teas Some naturally derived pesticides are not allowed for use on organic farms These include nicotine sulfate arsenic and strychnine Synthetic pesticides allowed for use on organic farms include insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils for insect management and Bordeaux mixture copper hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate for managing fungi Copper sulfate and Bordeaux mixture copper sulfate plus lime approved for organic use in various jurisdictions can be more environmentally problematic than some synthetic fungicides disallowed in organic farming Similar concerns apply to copper hydroxide Repeated application of copper sulfate or copper hydroxide as a fungicide may eventually result in copper accumulation to toxic levels in soil and admonitions to avoid excessive accumulations of copper in soil appear in various organic standards and elsewhere Environmental concerns for several kinds of biota arise at average rates of use of such substances for some crops In the European Union where replacement of copperbased fungicides in organic agriculture is a policy priority research is seeking alternatives for organic production Livestock Raising livestock and poultry for meat dairy and eggs is another traditional farming activity that complements growing Organic farms attempt to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic Organic livestock may be and must be treated with medicine when they are sick but drugs cannot be used to promote growth their feed must be organic and they must be pastured 19ff Also horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labour for hauling and plowing fertility through recycling of manure and fuel in the form of food for farmers and other animals While today small growing operations often do not include livestock domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation especially for true sustainability the ability of a farm to function as a selfrenewing unit Genetic modification A key characteristic of organic farming is the exclusion of genetically engineered plants and animals On 19 October 1998 participants at IFOAMs 12th Scientific Conference issued the Mar del Plata Declaration where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in organic food production and agriculture Although opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong agricultural researchers Luis HerreraEstrella and Ariel AlvarezMorales continue to advocate integration of transgenic technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture particularly in the developing world Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticist Pamela Ronald write that many agricultural applications of biotechnology are consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture Although GMOs are excluded from organic farming there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and heirloom seed stocks making it difficult if not impossible to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries as described in the article on regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms Tools Organic farmers use a number of traditional farm tools to do farming and may make use of agricultural machinery in similar ways to conventional farming In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and diesel powered water pumps Standards Standards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture Standards may be voluntary or legislated As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers In the 1980s governments began to produce organic production guidelines In the 1990s a trend toward legislated standards began most notably with the 1991 EUEcoregulation developed for European Union which set standards for 12 countries and a 1993 UK program The EUs program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001 and in 2002 the US created the National Organic Program NOP As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming IFOAM 200711 In 2005 IFOAM created the Principles of Organic Agriculture an international guideline for certification criteria Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms Production materials used for the creation of USDA Organic certified foods require the approval of a NOP accredited certifier EUorganic productionregulation on organic food labels define organic primarily in terms of whether natural or artificial substances were allowed as inputs in the food production process Composting Using manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria including pathogenic strains of E coli that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food To combat this risk USDA organic standards require that manure must be sterilized through high temperature thermophilic composting If raw animal manure is used 120 days must pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil For products that do not directly contact soil 90 days must pass prior to harvest In the US the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 OFPA as amended specifies that a farm can not be certified as organic if the compost being used contains any synthetic ingredients The OFPA singles out commercially blended fertilizers composts disallowing the use of any fertilizer compost that contains prohibited materials Economics The economics of organic farming a subfield of agricultural economics encompasses the entire process and effects of organic farming in terms of human society including social costs opportunity costs unintended consequences information asymmetries and economies of scale Labour input carbon and methane emissions energy use eutrophication acidification soil quality effect on biodiversity and overall land use vary considerably between individual farms and between crops making general comparisons between the economics of organic and conventional agriculture difficult In the European Union organic farmers receive more subsidies under agrienvironment and animal welfare subsidies than conventional growers Geographic producer distribution The markets for organic products are strongest in North America and Europe which as of 2001 are estimated to have 6 and 8 billion respectively of the 20 billion global market 6 As of 2007 Australasia has 39 of the total organic farmland including Australias 11800000 hectares 29000000 acres but 97 of this land is sprawling rangeland 200735 US sales are 20x as much 7 Europe farms 23 of global organic farmland 6900000 ha 17000000 acres followed by Latin America and the Caribbean with 20 6400000 ha 16000000 acres Asia has 95 while North America has 72 Africa has 3 Besides Australia the countries with the most organic farmland are Argentina 31 million hectares 77 million acres China 23 million hectares 57 million acres and the United States 16 million hectares 40 million acres Much of Argentinas organic farmland is pasture like that of Australia 200742 Spain Germany Brazil the worlds largest agricultural exporter Uruguay and England follow the United States in the amount of organic land 200726 In the European Union EU25 39 of the total utilized agricultural area was used for organic production in 2005 The countries with the highest proportion of organic land were Austria 11 and Italy 84 followed by the Czech Republic and Greece both 72 The lowest figures were shown for Malta 02 Poland 06 and Ireland 08 In 2009 the proportion of organic land in the EU grew to 47 The countries with the highest share of agricultural land were Liechtenstein 269 Austria 185 and Sweden 126 16 of all farmers in Austria produced organically in 2010 By the same year the proportion of organic land increased to 20 In 2005 168000 hectares 420000 acres of land in Poland was under organic management In 2012 288261 hectares 712310 acres were under organic production and there were about 15500 organic farmers retail sales of organic products were EUR 80 million in 2011 As of 2012 organic exports were part of the governments economic development strategy After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 agricultural inputs that had previously been purchased from Eastern bloc countries were no longer available in Cuba and many Cuban farms converted to organic methods out of necessity Consequently organic agriculture is a mainstream practice in Cuba while it remains an alternative practice in most other countries Cubas organic strategy includes development of genetically modified crops specifically corn that is resistant to the palomilla moth Growth In 2001 the global market value of certified organic products was estimated at US20 billion By 2002 this was US23 billion and by 2015 more than US43 billion By 2014 retail sales of organic products reached US80 billion worldwide North America and Europe accounted for more than 90 of all organic product sales In 2018 Australia accounted for 54 of the worlds certified organic land with the country recording more than 35000000 verified organic hectares 86000000 acres Organic agricultural land increased almost fourfold in 15 years from 11 million hectares 27 million acres in 1999 to 437 million hectares 108 million acres in 2014 Between 2013 and 2014 organic agricultural land grew by 500 thousand hectares 1200000 acres worldwide increasing in every region except Latin America During this time period Europes organic farmland increased 260 thousand hectares 640000 acres to 116 million hectares 29 million acres 23 Asias increased 159 thousand hectares 390000 acres to 36 million hectares 89 million acres 47 Africas increased 54 thousand hectares 130000 acres to 13 million hectares 32 million acres total 45 and North Americas increased 35 thousand hectares 86000 acres to 31 million hectares 77 million acres total 11 As of 2014 the country with the most organic land was Australia 172 million hectares 43 million acres followed by Argentina 31 million hectares 77 million acres and the United States 22 million hectares 54 million acres Australias organic land area has increased at a rate of 165 per annum for the past eighteen years In 2013 the number of organic producers grew by almost 270000 or more than 13 By 2014 there were a reported 23 million organic producers in the world Most of the total global increase took place in the Philippines Peru China and Thailand Overall the majority of all organic producers are in India 650000 in 2013 Uganda 190552 in 2014 Mexico 169703 in 2013 and the Philippines 165974 in 2014 In 2016 organic farming produced over 1 million metric tons 980000 long tons 1100000 short tons of bananas over 800 thousand metric tons 790000 long tons 880000 short tons of soybean and just under 500 thousand metric tons 490000 long tons 550000 short tons of coffee Productivity Studies comparing yields have had mixed results These differences among findings can often be attributed to variations between study designs including differences in the crops studied and the methodology by which results were gathered A 2012 metaanalysis found that productivity is typically lower for organic farming than conventional farming but that the size of the difference depends on context and in some cases may be very small While organic yields can be lower than conventional yields another metaanalysis published in Sustainable Agriculture Research in 2015 concluded that certain organic onfarm practices could help narrow this gap Timely weed management and the application of manure in conjunction with legume foragescover crops were shown to have positive results in increasing organic corn and soybean productivity Another metaanalysis published in the journal Agricultural Systems in 2011 analyzed 362 datasets and found that organic yields were on average 80 of conventional yields The authors found that there are relative differences in this yield gap based on crop type with crops like soybeans and rice scoring higher than the 80 average and crops like wheat and potato scoring lower Across global regions Asia and Central Europe were found to have relatively higher yields and Northern Europe relatively lower than the average Long term studies A study published in 2005 compared conventional cropping organic animalbased cropping and organic legumebased cropping on a test farm at the Rodale Institute over 22 years The study found that the crop yields for corn and soybeans were similar in the organic animal organic legume and conventional farming systems It also found that significantly less fossil energy was expended to produce corn in the Rodale Institutes organic animal and organic legume systems than in the conventional production system There was little difference in energy input between the different treatments for producing soybeans In the organic systems synthetic fertilizers and pesticides were generally not used As of 2013 the Rodale study was ongoing and a thirtyyear anniversary report was published by Rodale in 2012 A longterm field study comparing organicconventional agriculture carried out over 21 years in Switzerland concluded that Crop yields of the organic systems averaged over 21 experimental years at 80 of the conventional ones The fertilizer input however was 34 51 lower indicating an efficient production The organic farming systems used 20 56 less energy to produce a crop unit and per land area this difference was 36 53 In spite of the considerably lower pesticide input the quality of organic products was hardly discernible from conventional analytically and even came off better in food preference trials and picture creating methods Profitability In the United States organic farming has been shown to be 27 to 38 times more profitable for the farmer than conventional farming when prevailing price premiums are taken into account Globally organic farming is 2235 more profitable for farmers than conventional methods according to a 2015 metaanalysis of studies conducted across five continents The profitability of organic agriculture can be attributed to a number of factors First organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs which can be costly In addition organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield The price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming In 2013 there was a 100 price premium on organic vegetables and a 57 price premium for organic fruits These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices available through the United States Department of Agricultures Economic Research Service Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold farmers markets grocery stores or wholesale to restaurants For many producers direct sales at farmers markets are most profitable because the farmer receives the entire markup however this is also the most time and labourintensive approach There have been signs of organic price premiums narrowing in recent years which lowers the economic incentive for farmers to convert to or maintain organic production methods Data from 22 years of experiments at the Rodale Institute found that based on the current yields and production costs associated with organic farming in the United States a price premium of only 10 is required to achieve parity with conventional farming A separate study found that on a global scale price premiums of only 57 were needed to break even with conventional methods Without the price premium profitability for farmers is mixed 11 For markets and supermarkets organic food is profitable as well and is generally sold at significantly higher prices than nonorganic food Energy efficiency Compared to conventional agriculture the energy efficiency of organic farming depends upon crop type and farm size Two studies both comparing organically versus conventionallyfarmed apples declare contradicting results one saying organic farming is more energy efficient the other saying conventionally is more efficient It has generally been found that the labor input per unit of yield was higher for organic systems compared with conventional production Sales and marketing Most sales are concentrated in developed nations In 2008 69 of Americans claimed to occasionally buy organic products down from 73 in 2005 One theory for this change was that consumers were substituting local produce for organic produce Distributors The USDA requires that distributors manufacturers and processors of organic products be certified by an accredited state or private agency In 2007 there were 3225 certified organic handlers up from 2790 in 2004 Organic handlers are often small firms 48 reported sales below 1 million annually and 22 between 1 and 5 million per year Smaller handlers are more likely to sell to independent natural grocery stores and natural product chains whereas large distributors more often market to natural product chains and conventional supermarkets with a small group marketing to independent natural product stores Some handlers work with conventional farmers to convert their land to organic with the knowledge that the farmer will have a secure sales outlet This lowers the risk for the handler as well as the farmer In 2004 31 of handlers provided technical support on organic standards or production to their suppliers and 34 encouraged their suppliers to transition to organic Smaller farms often join in cooperatives to market their goods more effectively 93 of organic sales are through conventional and natural food supermarkets and chains while the remaining 7 of US organic food sales occur through farmers markets foodservices and other marketing channels Directtoconsumer sales In the 2012 Census directtoconsumer sales equalled 13 billion up from 812 million in 2002 an increase of 60 percent The number of farms that utilize directtoconsumer sales was 144530 in 2012 in comparison to 116733 in 2002 Directtoconsumer sales include farmers markets community supported agriculture CSA onfarm stores and roadside farm stands Some organic farms also sell products direct to retailer direct to restaurant and direct to institution According to the 2008 Organic Production Survey approximately 7 of organic farm sales were directtoconsumers 10 went direct to retailers and approximately 83 went into wholesale markets In comparison only 04 of the value of convention agricultural commodities were directtoconsumers While not all products sold at farmers markets are certified organic this directtoconsumer avenue has become increasingly popular in local food distribution and has grown substantially since 1994 In 2014 there were 8284 farmers markets in comparison to 3706 in 2004 and 1755 in 1994 most of which are found in populated areas such as the Northeast Midwest and West Coast Labour and employment Organic production is more labourintensive than conventional production Increased labor cost is one factor that contributes to organic food being more expensive Organic farmings increased labor requirements can be seen in a good way providing more job opportunities for people The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report suggests that an increase in investment in green agriculture is projected to lead to growth in employment of about 60 per cent compared with current levels and that green agriculture investments could create 47 million additional jobs compared with BAU2 over the next 40 years Much of the growth in women labour participation in agriculture is outside the male dominated field of conventional agriculture Organic farming has a greater percentage of women working in the farms with 21 compared to farming in general with 14 Worlds food security In 2007 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO said that organic agriculture often leads to higher prices and hence a better income for farmers so it should be promoted However FAO stressed that organic farming could not feed the current human population much less the larger future population Both data and models showed that organic farming was far from sufficient Therefore chemical fertilizers were needed to avoid hunger Others have argued that organic farming is particularly wellsuited to foodinsecure areas and therefore could be an important part of increased food security in places like subSaharan Africa FAO stressed that fertilizers and other chemical inputs can increase production particularly in Africa where fertilizers are currently used 90 less than in Asia For example in Malawi the yield has been boosted using seeds and fertilizers Also NEPAD a development organization of African governments announced that feeding Africans and preventing malnutrition requires fertilizers and enhanced seeds According to a 2012 study from McGill University organic best management practices show an average yield only 13 less than conventional In the worlds poorer nations where most of the worlds hungry live and where conventional agricultures expensive inputs are not affordable for the majority of farmers adopting organic management actually increases yields 93 on average and could be an important part of increased food security Capacity building in developing countries Organic agriculture can contribute to ecological sustainability especially in poorer countries The application of organic principles enables employment of local resources eg local seed varieties manure etc and therefore costeffectiveness Local and international markets for organic products show tremendous growth prospects and offer creative producers and exporters excellent opportunities to improve their income and living conditions Organic agriculture is knowledge intensive Globally capacity building efforts are underway including localized training material to limited effect As of 2007 the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements hosted more than 170 free manuals and 75 training opportunities online In 2008 the United Nations Environmental Programme UNEP and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD stated that organic agriculture can be more conducive to food security in Africa than most conventional production systems and that it is more likely to be sustainable in the longterm and that yields had more than doubled where organic or nearorganic practices had been used and that soil fertility and drought resistance improved Millennium Development Goals The value of organic agriculture OA in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals MDG particularly in poverty reduction efforts in the face of climate change is shown by its contribution to both income and nonincome aspects of the MDGs These benefits are expected to continue in the postMDG era A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute ADBI and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and nonincome aspects of the MDGs These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes improved farmers health owing to less chemical exposure integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies improvement of access to safe water and sanitation and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains A related ADBI study also sheds on the costs of OA programs and set them in the context of the costs of attaining the MDGs The results show considerable variation across the case studies suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones However further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank based on income growth in general or based on the detailed costs of meeting some of the more quantifiable MDGs eg education health and environment Externalities Agriculture imposes negative externalities upon society through public land and other public resource use biodiversity loss erosion pesticides nutrient pollution and assorted other problems Positive externalities include selfreliance entrepreneurship respect for nature and air quality Organic methods differ from conventional methods in the impacts of their respective externalities dependent on implementation and crop type Overall land use is generally higher for organic methods but organic methods generally use less energy in production The analysis and comparison of externalities is complicated by whether the comparison is done using a per unit area measurement or per unit of production and whether analysis is done on isolated plots or on farm units as a whole Measurements of biodiversity are highly variable between studies farms and organism groups Birds predatory insects soil organisms and plants responded positively to organic farming while nonpredatory insects and pests did not A 2005 review found that the positive effects of organic farming on abundance were prominent at the plot and field scales but not for farms in matched landscapes Other studies that have attempted to examine and compare conventional and organic systems of farming and have found that organic techniques reduce levels of biodiversity less than conventional systems do and use less energy and produce less waste when calculated per unit area although not when calculated per unit of output Farm comparisons show that actual nitrate leaching rates per hectareacre are up to 57 lower on organic than on conventional fields However the leaching rates per unit of output were similar or slightly higher On a perhectareacre scale the CO2 emissions are 40 60 lower in organic farming systems than in conventional ones whereas on a perunit output scale the CO2 emissions tend to be higher in organic farming systems It has been proposed that organic agriculture can reduce the level of some negative externalities from conventional agriculture Whether the benefits are private or public depends upon the division of property rights Issues According to a meta analysis published in 2017 compared to conventional agriculture biological agriculture has a higher land requirement per yield unit a higher eutrophication potential a higher acidification potential and a lower energy requirement but is associated with similarly high greenhouse gas emissions A 2003 to 2005 investigation by the Cranfield University for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs in the UK found that it is difficult to compare the global warming potential acidification and eutrophication emissions but Organic production often results in increased burdens from factors such as nitrogen leaching and N2O emissions even though primary energy use was less for most organic products N2O is always the largest global warming potential contributor except in tomatoes However organic tomatoes always incur more burdens except pesticide use Some emissions were lower per area but organic farming always required 65 to 200 more field area than nonorganic farming The numbers were highest for bread wheat 200 more and potatoes 160 more As of 2020 it seems that organic agriculture can help in mitigating climate change but only if used in certain ways Environmental impact and emissions Researchers at Oxford University analysed 71 peerreviewed studies and observed that organic products are sometimes worse for the environment Organic milk cereals and pork generated higher greenhouse gas emissions per product than conventional ones but organic beef and olives had lower emissions in most studies Usually organic products required less energy but more land Per unit of product organic produce generates higher nitrogen leaching nitrous oxide emissions ammonia emissions eutrophication and acidification potential than conventionally grown produce Other differences were not significant The researchers concluded that public debate should consider various manners of employing conventional or organic farming and not merely debate conventional farming as opposed to organic farming They also sought to find specific solutions to specific circumstances A 2018 review article in the Annual Review of Resource Economics found that organic agriculture is more polluting per unit of output and that widespread upscaling of organic agriculture would cause additional loss of natural habitats Proponents of organic farming have claimed that organic agriculture emphasizes closed nutrient cycles biodiversity and effective soil management providing the capacity to mitigate and even reverse the effects of climate change and that organic agriculture can decrease fossil fuel emissions The carbon sequestration efficiency of organic systems in temperate climates is almost double 575700 kilograms per hectare per year 163198 lbacreMs that of conventional treatment of soils mainly owing to the use of grass clovers for feed and of cover crops in organic rotations However studies acknowledge organic systems require more acreage to produce the same yield as conventional farms By converting to organic farms in developed countries where most arable land is accounted for increased deforestation would decrease overall carbon sequestration Nutrient leaching According to a 2012 metaanalysis of 71 studies nitrogen leaching nitrous oxide emissions ammonia emissions eutrophication potential and acidification potential were higher for organic products Specifically the emission per area of land is lower but per amount of food produced is higher This is due to the lower crop yield of organic farms Excess nutrients in lakes rivers and groundwater can cause algal blooms eutrophication and subsequent dead zones In addition nitrates are harmful to aquatic organisms by themselves Land use A 2012 Oxford metaanalysis of 71 studies found that organic farming requires 84 more land for an equivalent amount of harvest mainly due to lack of nutrients but sometimes due to weeds diseases or pests lower yielding animals and land required for fertility building crops While organic farming does not necessarily save land for wildlife habitats and forestry in all cases the most modern breakthroughs in organic are addressing these issues with success Professor Wolfgang Branscheid says that organic animal production is not good for the environment because organic chicken requires twice as much land as conventional chicken and organic pork a quarter more According to a calculation by Hudson Institute organic beef requires three times as much land On the other hand certain organic methods of animal husbandry have been shown to restore desertified marginal andor otherwise unavailable land to agricultural productivity and wildlife Or by getting both forage and cash crop production from the same fields simultaneously reduce net land use SRI methods for rice production without external inputs have produced record yields on some farms but not others Pesticides In organic farming the use of synthetic pesticides and certain natural compounds that are produced using chemical synthesis are prohibited The organic labels restrictions are not only based on the nature of the compound but also on the method of production A nonexhaustive list of organic approved pesticides with their median lethal doses Boric acid is used as an insecticide LD50 2660 mgkg CopperII sulfate is used as a fungicide and is also used in conventional agriculture LD50 300 mgkg Conventional agriculture has the option to use the less toxic Mancozeb LD50 4500 to 11200 mgkg Lime sulfur aka calcium polysulfide and sulfur are considered to be allowed synthetic materials LD50 820 mgkg Neem oil is used as an insect repellant in India since it contains azadirachtin its use is restricted in the UK and Europe Pyrethrin comes from chemicals extracted from flowers of the genus Pyrethrum LD50 of 370 mgkg Its potent toxicity is used to control insects Food quality and safety While there may be some differences in the amounts of nutrients and antinutrients when organically produced food and conventionallyproduced food are compared the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results and there is insufficient evidence to make claims that organic food is safer or healthier than conventional food Soil conservation Supporters claim that organically managed soil has a higher quality and higher water retention This may help increase yields for organic farms in drought years Organic farming can build up soil organic matter better than conventional notill farming which suggests longterm yield benefits from organic farming An 18year study of organic methods on nutrientdepleted soil concluded that conventional methods were superior for soil fertility and yield for nutrientdepleted soils in coldtemperate climates arguing that much of the benefit from organic farming derives from imported materials that could not be regarded as selfsustaining In Dirt The Erosion of Civilizations geomorphologist David Montgomery outlines a coming crisis from soil erosion Agriculture relies on roughly one meter of topsoil and that is being depleted ten times faster than it is being replaced Notill farming which some claim depends upon pesticides is one way to minimize erosion However a 2007 study by the USDAs Agricultural Research Service has found that manure applications in tilled organic farming are better at building up the soil than notill Gunsmoke Farms a 137 square kilometres 53 square miles organic farming project in South Dakota suffered from massive soil erosion as result of tiling after it switched to organic farming Biodiversity The conservation of natural resources and biodiversity is a core principle of organic production Three broad management practices prohibitionreduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers sympathetic management of noncropped habitats and preservation of mixed farming that are largely intrinsic but not exclusive to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects provide habitat for birds and mammals and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include 1 decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs 2 reduced pestmanagement costs 3 more reliable sources of clean water and 4 better pollination Nearly all noncrop naturally occurring species observed in comparative farm land practice studies show a preference for organic farming both by abundance and diversity An average of 30 more species inhabit organic farms Birds butterflies soil microbes beetles earthworms spiders vegetation and mammals are particularly affected Lack of herbicides and pesticides improve biodiversity fitness and population density Many weed species attract beneficial insects that improve soil qualities and forage on weed pests Soilbound organisms often benefit because of increased bacteria populations due to natural fertilizer such as manure while experiencing reduced intake of herbicides and pesticides Increased biodiversity especially from beneficial soil microbes and mycorrhizae have been proposed as an explanation for the high yields experienced by some organic plots especially in light of the differences seen in a 21year comparison of organic and control fields Organic farming contributes to human capital by promoting biodiversity The presence of various species in organic farms helps to reduce human input such as fertilizers and pesticides which enhances sustainability The USDAs Agricultural Marketing Service AMS published a Federal Register notice on 15 January 2016 announcing the National Organic Program NOP final guidance on Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation for Certified Organic Operations Given the broad scope of natural resources which includes soil water wetland woodland and wildlife the guidance provides examples of practices that support the underlying conservation principles and demonstrate compliance with USDA organic regulations 205200 The final guidance provides organic certifiers and farms with examples of production practices that support conservation principles and comply with the USDA organic regulations which require operations to maintain or improve natural resources The final guidance also clarifies the role of certified operations to submit an OSP to a certifier certifiers ensure that the OSP describes or lists practices that explain the operators monitoring plan and practices to support natural resources and biodiversity conservation and inspectors onsite inspection in the implementation and verification of these production practices A wide range of organisms benefit from organic farming but it is unclear whether organic methods confer greater benefits than conventional integrated agrienvironmental programs Organic farming is often presented as a more biodiversityfriendly practice but the generality of the beneficial effects of organic farming is debated as the effects appear often species and contextdependent and current research has highlighted the need to quantify the relative effects of local and landscapescale management on farmland biodiversity There are four key issues when comparing the impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional farming 1 It remains unclear whether a holistic wholefarm approach ie organic provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped andor noncropped habitats within conventional agriculture ie agrienvironment schemes 2 Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions 3 Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited 4 There remains a pressing need for longitudinal systemlevel studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made Labour standards Organic agriculture is often considered to be more socially just and economically sustainable for farmworkers than conventional agriculture However there is little social science research or consensus as to whether or not organic agriculture provides better working conditions than conventional agriculture As many consumers equate organic and sustainable agriculture with smallscale familyowned organizations it is widely interpreted that buying organic supports better conditions for farmworkers than buying with conventional producers Organic agriculture is generally more labourintensive due to its dependence on manual practices for fertilization and pest removal Although illnesses from inputs pose less of a risk hired workers still fall victim to debilitating musculoskeletal disorders associated with agricultural work The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labour practices Independent certification initiatives such as the Agricultural Justice Project Domestic Fair Trade Working Group and the Food Alliance have attempted to implement farmworker interests but because these initiatives require voluntary participation of organic farms their standards cannot be widely enforced Despite the benefit to farmworkers of implementing labour standards there is little support among the organic community for these social requirements Many actors of the organic industry believe that enforcing labour standards would be unnecessary unacceptable or unviable due to the constraints of the market Regional support for organic farming The following is a selected list of support given in some regions Europe The EUorganic productionregulation is a part of the European Union regulation that sets rules about the production of organic agricultural and livestock products and how to label them In the EU organic farming and organic food are more commonly known as ecological or biological The regulation is derived from the guidelines of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements IFOAM which is an association of about 800 member organizations in 119 countries As in the rest of the world the organic market in Europe continues to grow and more land is farmed organically each year More farmers cultivate organically more land is certified organic and more countries report organic farming activities as per the 2016 edition of the study The World of Organic Agriculture Archived 11 November 2017 at the Wayback Machine according to data from the end of 2014 published by FiBL and IFOAM in 2016 Denmark Denmark has a long ongoing support for converting conventional farming into organic farming which has been taught in academic classes in universities since 1986 The state began substitutes and has promoted a special national label for products that qualify as organic since 1989 Denmark is thus the first country in the world to substitute organic farming promoting the concept and organizing the distribution of organic products Today the government accept applicants for financial support during conversion years as in Danish regulations farms must not have utilized conventional farming methods such as the usage of pesticides for several years before products can be assessed for qualification as organic This financial support has in recent years been cut due to organic farming increasing in profitability and some goods surpassing the profitability of conventional farming in domestic markets In general the financial situation of organic farmers in Denmark boomed between 2010 and 2018 while in 2018 serious nationwide longlasting droughts stagnated the economic results of organic farmers however the average farmer still achieved a net positive result that year In 2021 Denmarks and Europes largest slaughterhouse Danish Crown publicized its expectations of stagnating sales of conventional pork domestically however it expected increasing sales of organic pork and especially free range organic pork Besides the conversion support there are still base subsidies for organic farming paid per area of qualified farm land The first Danish private development organisation Samskologisk was established in 2013 by veteran organic farmers from the existing organisation kologisk Sams The development organisation has intentions to buy and invest in farmland and then lend the land to young and aspiring farmers seeking to get into farming especially organic farming This organisation reports 300 economical active members as of 2021 but does not publish the amount of acquired land or active lenders However the organic farming concept in Denmark is often not limited to organic farming as the definition is globally Instead the majority of organic farming is instead ecological farming The development of this concept has been parallel with the general organic farming movement and is most often used interchangeable with organic farming Thus there is a much stronger focus on the environmental and especially the ecological impact of ecological farming than organic farming Eg besides the base substitute for organic farming farmers can qualify for an extra substitute equal to 23 of the base for realizing a specific reduction in the usage of added nitrogen to the farmland also by organic means There are also parallels to the extended organic movements of regenerative agriculture although far from all concepts in regenerative agriculture are included in the national strategy at this time but exist as voluntary options for each farmer For these reasons international organic products do not fulfill the requirements of ecological farming and thus do not receive the domestic label for ecological products rather they receive the standard European Union organic label Ukraine The Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine is the central executive body that develops the regulatory framework for the organic sector in Ukraine maintains the state registers of certification bodies operators and organic seeds and planting material and provides training and professional development for organic inspectors Thanks to the hard work on organic legislation by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine and the organic working group that includes the main players of the Ukraines organic sector on 10 July 2018 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the Law of Ukraine On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products No 2496 which was enacted on 2 August 2019 As of April 2024 organic production circulation and labelling of organic products in Ukraine is regulated by this law as well as relevant bylaws One more important governmental institution of the organic sector of Ukraine is the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection It is the central executive body authorised to conduct state supervision control in the field of organic production circulation and labelling of organic products in accordance with the organic legislation of Ukraine This includes state supervision control over compliance with the legislation in the field of organic production circulation and labelling of organic products inspection of certification bodies random inspection of operators monitoring of organic products on the market to prevent the entry of nonorganic products labelled as organic The State Institution Entrepreneurship and Export Promotion Office EEPO Ukraine contributes to the development of the Ukrainian organic exporters potential promotion of the organic sector and formation of a positive image of Ukraine as a reliable supplier of organic products abroad EEPO actively supports and organises various events for organic exporters including national pavilions at key international trade fairs such as BIOFACH Nuremberg Germany Anuga Cologne Germany SIAL Paris France and Middle East Organic Natural Products Expo Dubai UAE EEPO also created the Catalogue of Ukrainian Exporters of Organic

Intercooperation and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL Switzerland Project GermanUkrainian Cooperation in Organic Agriculture COA The projectprogramme representatives provide their expertise during development of the organic legislative framework and implementation of the legislation in the field of organic production circulation and labelling of organic products and support various activities related to organic farming and production China The Chinese government especially the local government has provided various supports for the development of organic agriculture since the 1990s Organic farming has been recognized by local governments for its potential in promoting sustainable rural development It is common for local governments to facilitate land access of agribusinesses by negotiating land leasing with local farmers The government also establishes demonstration organic gardens provides training for organic food companies to pass certifications subsidizes organic certification fees pest repellent lamps organic fertilizer and so on The government has also been playing an active role in marketing organic products through organizing organic food expos and branding supports India In India in 2016 the northern state of Sikkim achieved its goal of converting to 100 organic farming Other states of India including Kerala Mizoram Goa Rajasthan and Meghalaya have also declared their intentions to shift to fully organic cultivation The South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh is also promoting organic farming especially Zero Budget Natural Farming ZBNF which is a form of regenerative agriculture As of 2018 India has the largest number of organic farmers in the world and constitutes more than 30 of organic farmers globally India has 835000 certified organic producers However the total land under organic cultivation is around 2 of overall farmland Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic has successfully converted a large amount of its banana crop to organic The Dominican Republic accounts for 55 of the worlds certified organic bananas South Korea The most noticeable change in Koreas agriculture occurred throughout the 1960s and 1970s More specifically the Green Revolution program where South Korea experienced reforestations and agricultural revolution Due to a food shortage during Park Chung Hees presidency the government encouraged rice varieties suited for organic farming Farmers were able to strategize risk minimization efforts by breeding a variety of rice called Japonica with Tongil They also used less fertilizer and made other economic adjustments to alleviate potential risk factors In modern society organic farming and food policies have changed more specifically since the 1990s As expected the guidelines focus on basic dietary recommendations for consumption of nutrients and Koreanstyle diets The main reason for this encouragement is that around 88 of countries across the world face forms of malnutrition Then in 2009 the Special Act on Safety Management of Childrens Dietary Life was passed restricting foods low in energy and poor in nutrients It also focused on other nutritional problems Korean students may have had as well Thailand In Thailand the Institute for Sustainable Agricultural Communities ISAC was established in 1991 to promote organic farming among other sustainable agricultural practices The national target via the National Plan for Organic Farming is to attain by 2021 13 million rai 2100 square kilometres 800 square miles of organically farmed land Another target is for 40 of the produce from these farmlands to be consumed domestically Much progress has been made Many organic farms have sprouted growing produce ranging from mangosteen to stinky bean Some of the farms have also established education centres to promote and share their organic farming techniques and knowledge In Chiang Mai Province there are 18 organic markets ISAClinked United States The United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development USDARD was created in 1994 as a subsection of the USDA that implements programs to stimulate growth in rural communities One of the programs that the USDARD created provided grants to farmers who practiced organic farming through the Organic Certification Cost Share Program OCCSP During the 21st century the United States has continued to expand its reach in the organic foods market doubling the number of organic farms in the US in 2016 when compared to 2011 Employment on organic farms offers potentially large numbers of jobs for people and this may better manage the Fourth Industrial Revolution Moreover sustainable forestry fishing and mining and other conservationoriented activities provide larger numbers of jobs than more fossil fuel and mechanized work Organic Farming has grown by 353 million acres 1430000 hectares in the US from 2000 to 2011 In 2016 California had 2713 organic farms which makes California the largest producer of organic goods in the US 4 of food sales in the US are of organic goods Sri Lanka As was the case with most countries Sri Lanka made the transition away from organic farming upon the arrival of the Green Revolution whereupon it started depending more on chemical fertilizers This became a highly popularized method when the nation started offering subsidies on the import of artificial fertilizers to increase rice paddy production and to incentivize farmers to switch from growing traditional varieties into using high yielding varieties HYVs This was especially true for young farmers who saw shortterm economic profit as more sustainable to their wellbeing compared to the long term drawbacks to the environment However due to the various health concerns with inorganic farming including the possibility of a chronic kidney disease being associated with chemical fertilizers many middle aged and experienced farmers displayed skepticism towards these new approaches Some even resorted to organic farming or utilizing insecticide free fertilizers for their crops In a study conducted by F Horgan and E Kudavidanage the researchers compared crop yields of farmers in Sri Lanka who employed distinct farming techniques including organic farmers who grew traditional varieties and insecticidefree fertilizer users and pesticide users who grew modern varieties No significant difference was found among the yield productions and in fact organic farmers and insecticidefree fertilizer users lamented less about insects such as planthoppers as a challenge to their production Regardless many farmers continued to use insecticides to avoid the predicted dangers of pests to their crops and the cheap sale of agrochemicals provided an easy approach to augment crop growth Additionally while organic farming has health benefits its a strenuous task which requires more man power Although that presented a great opportunity for increased employment in Sri Lanka the economic compensation was not enough to suffice the living expenses of those employed Thus most farmers relied on modern methods to run their household especially after the economic stressors brought on by COVID19 However while Sri Lanka was still facing the new challenges of the pandemic in the 2019 presidential election campaign the president Gotabaya Rajapaksa proposed a 10year national transition to organic farming to declare Sri Lanka as the first nation to be known for its organic produce On April 27 2021 the country issued an order prohibiting the import of any inorganic pesticides or fertilizers creating chaos among farmers While such a change was made over concerns for the nations ecosystems and the health of citizens where pesticide poisonings prevailed over other health related deaths the precipitous decision was met with criticism from the agriculture industry This included fears that the mandate would harm the yields of the countrys major crops despite claims to the contrary that the country would not be able to produce enough organic fertilizer domestically and organic farming being more expensive and complex than conventional agriculture To put this into perspective 74 of Sri Lankas GDP is reliant on agriculture and 30 of citizens work in this sector This means that about of its population is dependent on this sector for jobs making its maintenance highly crucial for the prosperity of the nations social and economic status Of special concern was rice and tea which are a staple food and major export respectively Despite it being a record crop in the first half of 2021 the tea crop began to decline in July of that year Rice production fell by 20 over the first six months of the ban and prices increased by around 50 Contrary to its past success at selfsustainability the country had to import US450 million worth of rice to meet domestic demand In late August the government acknowledged the ban had created a critical dependency on supplies of imported organic fertilizers but by then food prices had already increased twofold in some cases In September 2021 the government declared an economic emergency citing the bans impact on food prices as well as inflation from the devaluation of Sri Lankan currency due to the crashing tea industry and a lack of tourism induced by COVID19 restrictions In November 2021 the country partially lifted the ban on inorganic farming for certain key crops such as rubber and tea and began to offer compensation and subsidies to farmers and rice producers in an attempt to cover losses The previous subsidies on synthetic fertilizer imports were not reintroduced See also References Further reading Ableman M April 1993 From the Good Earth A Celebration of Growing Food Around

    title: "Ancient Egypt",
    originalContent:
      "Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River situated within the contemporary territory of modernday Egypt Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC according to conventional Egyptian chronology with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under pharaoh or king Menes often identified with Narmer The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods The various kingdoms fall into one of three categories the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age Ancient Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Levant After this period it entered an era of slow decline During the course of its history ancient Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers including the Hyksos the Nubians the Assyrians the Achaemenid Persians and the Macedonians under Alexander the Great The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom formed in the aftermath of Alexanders death ruled until 30 BC when under Cleopatra it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province Egypt remained under Roman control until 642 AD when it was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops which supported a more dense population and social development and culture With resources to spare the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects trade with surrounding regions and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes religious leaders and administrators under the control of a pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids temples and obelisks a system of mathematics a practical and effective system of medicine irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques the first known planked boats Egyptian faience and glass technology new forms of literature and the earliest known peace treaty made with the Hittites Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy Its art and architecture were widely copied and its antiquities were carried off to be studied admired or coveted in the far corners of the world Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia A newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians has led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy History The Nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization Nomadic modern human huntergatherers began living in the Nile valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120000 years ago By the late Paleolithic period the arid climate of Northern Africa had become increasingly hot and dry forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region Predynastic period In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl Hunting would have been common for Egyptians and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated By about 5500 BC small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry and identifiable by their pottery and personal items such as combs bracelets and beads The largest of these early cultures in upper Southern Egypt was the Badarian culture which probably originated in the Western Desert it was known for its highquality ceramics stone tools and its use of copper The Badari was followed by the Naqada culture the Naqada I Amratian the Naqada II Gerzeh and Naqada III Semainean These brought a number of technological improvements As early as the Naqada I Period predynastic Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia used to shape blades and other objects from flakes Mutual trade with the Levant was established during Naqada II c 36003350 BC this period was also the beginning of trade with Mesopotamia which continued into the early dynastic period and beyond Over a period of about 1000 years the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley Establishing a power center at Nekhen in Greek Hierakonpolis and later at Abydos Naqada III leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the Nile They also traded with Nubia to the south the oases of the western desert to the west and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East to the east The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite as well as societal personaluse items which included combs small statuary painted pottery high quality decorative stone vases cosmetic palettes and jewelry made of gold lapis and ivory They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups amulets and figurines During the last predynastic phase the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language Early Dynastic Period c 31502686 BC The Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the early SumerianAkkadian civilization of Mesopotamia and of ancient Elam The thirdcentury BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long line of kings from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties a system still used today He began his official history with the king named Meni or Menes in Greek who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented and there is no contemporary record of Menes Some scholars now believe however that the mythical Menes may have been the king Narmer who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette in a symbolic act of unification In the Early Dynastic Period which began about 3000 BC the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis from which he could control the labor force and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the Levant The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land labor and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization Old Kingdom 26862181 BC Major advances in architecture art and technology were made during the Old Kingdom fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population growth made possible by a welldeveloped central administration Some of ancient Egypts crowning achievements the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx were constructed during the Old Kingdom Under the direction of the vizier state officials collected taxes coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield drafted peasants to work on construction projects and established a justice system to maintain peace and order With the rising importance of central administration in Egypt a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration As the power of the kings diminished regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king This coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC is believed to have caused the country to enter the 140year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period First Intermediate Period 21812055 BC After Egypts central government collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom the administration could no longer support or stabilize the countrys economy Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and smallscale civil wars Yet despite difficult problems local leaders owing no tribute to the king used their newfound independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces Once in control of their own resources the provinces became economically richerwhich was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes In bursts of creativity provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period Free from their loyalties to the king local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power By 2160 BC rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north while a rival clan based in Thebes the Intef family took control of Upper Egypt in the south As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable Around 2055 BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers reuniting the Two Lands They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom Middle Kingdom 21341690 BC The kings of the Middle Kingdom restored the countrys stability and prosperity thereby stimulating a resurgence of art literature and monumental building projects Mentuhotep II and his Eleventh Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes but the vizier Amenemhat I upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty around 1985 BC shifted the kingdoms capital to the city of Itjtawy located in Faiyum From Itjtawy the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a farsighted land reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region Moreover the military reconquered territory in Nubia that was rich in quarries and gold mines while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta called the Walls of the Ruler to defend against foreign attack With the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal the nations population arts and religion flourished In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods the Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident eloquent style The relief and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom Amenemhat III allowed Semiticspeaking Canaanite settlers from the Near East into the Delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns These ambitious building and mining activities however combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties During this decline the Canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the Delta region eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos Second Intermediate Period 16741549 BC and the Hyksos Around 1785 BC as the power of the Middle Kingdom kings weakened a Western Asian people called the Hyksos who had already settled in the Delta seized control of Egypt and established their capital at Avaris forcing the former central government to retreat to Thebes The king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute The Hyksos foreign rulers retained Egyptian models of government and identified as kings thereby integrating Egyptian elements into their culture They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt most notably the composite bow and the horsedrawn chariot After retreating south the native Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos Nubian allies the Kushites to the south After years of vassalage Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years until 1555 BC The kings Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt but failed to defeat the Hyksos That task fell to Kamoses successor Ahmose I who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos presence in Egypt He established a new dynasty and in the New Kingdom that followed the military became a central priority for the kings who sought to expand Egypts borders and attempted to gain mastery of the Near East New Kingdom 15491069 BC The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours including the Mitanni Empire Assyria and Canaan Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen Between their reigns Hatshepsut a queen who established herself as pharaoh launched many building projects including the restoration of temples damaged by the Hyksos and sent trading expeditions to Punt and the Sinai When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC Egypt had an empire extending from Niya in north west Syria to the Fourth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood The New Kingdom pharaohs began a largescale building campaign to promote the god Amun whose growing cult was based in Karnak They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements both real and imagined The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built Around 1350 BC the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms Changing his name to Akhenaten he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity suppressed the worship of most other deities and moved the capital to the new city of Akhetaten modernday Amarna He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style After his death the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored The subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun Ay and Horemheb worked to erase all mention of Akhenatens heresy now known as the Amarna Period Around 1279 BC Ramesses II also known as Ramesses the Great ascended the throne and went on to build more temples erect more statues and obelisks and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history A bold military leader Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh in modern Syria and after fighting to a stalemate finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty around 1258 BC Egypts wealth however made it a tempting target for invasion particularly by the Libyan Berbers to the west and the Sea Peoples a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea Initially the military was able to repel these invasions but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan much of it falling to the Assyrians The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption tomb robbery and civil unrest After regaining their power the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period Third Intermediate Period 1069653 BC Following the death of Ramesses XI in 1078 BC Smendes assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt ruling from the city of Tanis The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes who recognized Smendes in name only During this time Libyans had been settling in the western delta and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945 BC founding the socalled Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that would rule for some 200 years Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis and Kushites threatened from the south Around 727 BC the Kushite king Piye invaded northward seizing control of Thebes and eventually the Delta which established the 25th Dynasty During the 25th Dynasty Pharaoh Taharqa created an empire nearly as large as the New Kingdoms Twentyfifth Dynasty pharaohs built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley including at Memphis Karnak Kawa and Jebel Barkal During this period the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids many in modern Sudan since the Middle Kingdom Egypts farreaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period Its foreign allies had fallen under the Assyrian sphere of influence and by 700 BC war between the two states became inevitable Between 671 and 667 BC the Assyrians began the Assyrian conquest of Egypt The reigns of both Taharqa and his successor Tanutamun were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories Ultimately the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia occupied Memphis and sacked the temples of Thebes Late Period 653332 BC The Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the TwentySixth Dynasty By 653 BC the Saite king Psamtik I was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries who were recruited to form Egypts first navy Greek influence expanded greatly as the citystate of Naucratis became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture but in 525 BC the Persian Empire led by Cambyses II began its conquest of Egypt eventually defeating the pharaoh Psamtik III at the Battle of Pelusium Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh but ruled Egypt from Iran leaving Egypt under the control of a satrap A few revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century BC but Egypt was never able to overthrow the Persians until the end of the century Following its annexation by Persia Egypt was joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire This first period of Persian rule over Egypt also known as the TwentySeventh Dynasty ended in 402 BC when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties The last of these dynasties the Thirtieth proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt ending with the kingship of Nectanebo II A brief restoration of Persian rule sometimes known as the ThirtyFirst Dynasty began in 343 BC but shortly after in 332 BC the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to Alexander the Great without a fight Ptolemaic period 33230 BC In 332 BC Alexander the Great conquered Egypt with little resistance from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer The administration established by Alexanders successors the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule and became a centre of learning and culture that included the famous Library of Alexandria as part of the Mouseion The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the cityas the Ptolemies made commerce and revenuegenerating enterprises such as papyrus manufacturing their top priority Hellenistic culture did not supplant native Egyptian culture as the Ptolemies supported timehonored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace They built new temples in Egyptian style supported traditional cults and portrayed themselves as pharaohs Some traditions merged as Greek and Egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities such as Serapis and classical Greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion bitter family rivalries and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of Ptolemy IV In addition as Rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country Continued Egyptian revolts ambitious politicians and powerful opponents from the Near East made this situation unstable leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire Roman period 30 BC AD 641 Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire in 30 BC following the defeat of Mark Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian later Emperor Augustus in the Battle of Actium The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt and the Roman army under the control of a prefect appointed by the emperor quelled rebellions strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes and prevented attacks by bandits which had become a notorious problem during the period Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued The art of mummy portraiture flourished and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians From the midfirst century AD Christianity took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted However it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from the pagan Egyptian and GrecoRoman religions and threatened popular religious traditions This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303 but eventually Christianity won out In 391 the Christian emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples Alexandria became the scene of great antipagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed As a consequence Egypts native religious culture was continually in decline While the native population continued to speak their language the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert In the fourth century as the Roman Empire divided Egypt found itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople In the waning years of the Empire Egypt fell to the Sasanian Persian army in the Sasanian conquest of Egypt 618628 It was then recaptured by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius 629639 and was finally captured by Muslim Rashidun army in 639641 marking the end of both Byzantine rule and of the period typically considered Ancient Egypt Government and economy Administration and commerce The pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and at least in theory wielded complete control of the land and its resources The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs In charge of the administration was his second in command the vizier who acted as the kings representative and coordinated land surveys the treasury building projects the legal system and the archives At a regional level the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction The temples formed the backbone of the economy Not only were they places of worship but were also responsible for collecting and storing the kingdoms wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers who redistributed grain and goods Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled Although the ancient Egyptians did not use coinage until the Late period they did use a type of moneybarter system with standard sacks of grain and the deben a weight of roughly 91 grams 3 oz of copper or silver forming a common denominator Workers were paid in grain a simple laborer might earn 512 sacks 200 kg or 400 lb of grain per month while a foreman might earn 712 sacks 250 kg or 550 lb Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading for example a shirt cost five copper deben while a cow cost 140 deben Grain could be traded for other goods according to the fixed price list During the fifth century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of precious metal rather than true money but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage Social status Egyptian society was highly stratified and social status was expressly displayed Farmers made up the bulk of the population but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state temple or noble family that owned the land Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corve system Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers but they were also under state control working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt known as the white kilt class in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature Below the nobility were the priests physicians and engineers with specialized training in their field It is unclear whether slavery as understood today existed in ancient Egypt there is difference of opinions among authors The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women including people from all social classes as essentially equal under the law and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress Although slaves were mostly used as indentured servants they were able to buy and sell their servitude work their way to freedom or nobility and were usually treated by doctors in the workplace Both men and women had the right to own and sell property make contracts marry and divorce receive inheritance and pursue legal disputes in court Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece Rome and even more modern places around the world ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices legal rights and opportunities for achievement Women such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra VII even became pharaohs while others wielded power as Divine Wives of Amun Despite these freedoms ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration aside from the royal high priestesses apparently served only secondary roles in the temples not much data for many dynasties and were not so probably to be as educated as men Legal system The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh who was responsible for enacting laws delivering justice and maintaining law and order a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Maat Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a commonsense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes Local councils of elders known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes More serious cases involving murder major land transactions and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet over which the vizier or pharaoh presided Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth In some cases the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any coconspirators Whether the charges were trivial or serious court scribes documented the complaint testimony and verdict of the case for future reference Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines beatings facial mutilation or exile depending on the severity of the offense Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution carried out by decapitation drowning or impaling the criminal on a stake Punishment could also be extended to the criminals family Beginning in the New Kingdom oracles played a major role in the legal system dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases The procedure was to ask the god a yes or no question concerning the right or wrong of an issue The god carried by a number of priests rendered judgement by choosing one or the other moving forward or backward or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon Agriculture A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural technological and artistic pursuits Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River The Egyptians recognized three seasons Akhet flooding Peret planting and Shemu harvesting The flooding season lasted from June to September depositing on the rivers banks a layer of mineralrich silt ideal for growing crops After the floodwaters had receded the growing season lasted from October to February Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields which were irrigated with ditches and canals Egypt received little rainfall so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops From March to May farmers used sickles to harvest their crops which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain and the grain was then ground into flour brewed to make beer or stored for later use The ancient Egyptians cultivated emmer and barley and several other cereal grains all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer Flax plants uprooted before they started flowering were grown for the fibers of their stems These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots close to habitations and on higher ground and had to be watered by hand Vegetables included leeks garlic melons squashes pulses lettuce and other crops in addition to grapes that were made into wine Animals The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order thus humans animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole Animals both domesticated and wild were therefore a critical source of spirituality companionship and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians Cattle were the most important livestock the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them In addition to cattle the ancient Egyptians kept sheep goats and pigs Poultry such as ducks geese and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms where they were forcefed with dough to fatten them The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom and provided both honey and wax The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period Camels although known from the New Kingdom were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly used in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land Cats dogs and monkeys were common family pets while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa such as SubSaharan African lions were reserved for royalty Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses During the Late Period the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth and these animals were kept in large numbers for the purpose of ritual sacrifice Natural resources Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone copper and lead ores gold and semiprecious stones These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments sculpt statues make tools and fashion jewelry Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster Orebearing rock formations were found in distant inhospitable wadis in the Eastern Desert and the Sinai requiring large statecontrolled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there There were extensive gold mines in Nubia and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite greywacke and gold Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances The Egyptians worked deposits of the lead ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers plumb bobs and small figurines Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits or by the more laborintensive process of grinding and washing goldbearing quartzite Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were used in the Late Period Highquality building stones were abundant in Egypt the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley granite from Aswan and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the Eastern Desert Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry greywacke alabaster and carnelian dotted the Eastern Desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods miners worked deposits of emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi elHudi Trade The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare exotic goods not found in Egypt In the Predynastic Period they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense They also established trade with Palestine as evidenced by Palestinianstyle oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty Tell esSakan in presentday Gaza was established as an Egyptian settlement in the late 4th millennium BC and is theorised to have been the main Egyptian colonial site in the region Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt By the Second Dynasty at latest ancient Egyptian trade with Byblos yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt By the Fifth Dynasty trade with Punt provided gold aromatic resins ebony ivory and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli which had to be imported from faraway Afghanistan Egypts Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete which provided among other goods supplies of olive oil Language Historical development The Egyptian language is a northern AfroAsiatic language closely related to the Berber and Semitic languages It has the longest known history of any language having been written from c 3200 BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian Middle Egyptian Classical Egyptian Late Egyptian Demotic and Coptic Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language but it became more analytic later on Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles which replaced the older inflectional suffixes There was a change from the older verbsubjectobject word order to subjectverbobject The Egyptian hieroglyphic hieratic and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic Sounds and grammar Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other AfroAsiatic languages These include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants voiced and voiceless stops voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates It has three long and three short vowels which expanded in Late Egyptian to about nine The basic word in Egyptian similar to Semitic and Berber is a triliteral or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants Suffixes are added to form words The verb conjugation corresponds to the person For example the triconsonantal skeleton SM is the semantic core of the word hear its basic conjugation is sm he hears If the subject is a noun suffixes are not added to the verb sm mt the woman hears Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with Arabic The word order is predicatesubject in verbal and adjectival sentences and subjectpredicate in nominal and adverbial sentences The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun Verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences Stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable which can be open CV or closed CVC Writing Hieroglyphic writing dates from c 3000 BC and is composed of hundreds of symbols A hieroglyph can represent a word a sound or a silent determinative and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts Hieroglyphs were a formal script used on stone monuments and in tombs that could be as detailed as individual works of art In daytoday writing scribes used a cursive form of writing called hieratic which was quicker and easier While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction though typically written from right to left hieratic was always written from right to left usually in horizontal rows A new form of writing Demotic became the prevalent writing style and it is this form of writingalong with formal hieroglyphsthat accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone Around the first century AD the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet with the addition of some Demotic signs Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt but only in the 1820s after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by Thomas Young and JeanFranois Champollion were hieroglyphs substantially deciphered Literature Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs It was primarily an occupation of the scribes who worked out of the Per Ankh institution or the House of Life The latter comprised offices libraries called House of Books laboratories and observatories Some of the bestknown pieces of ancient Egyptian literature such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts were written in Classical Egyptian which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300 BC Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents love poetry and tales as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts During this period the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography such as those of Harkhuf and Weni The genre known as Sebayt instructions was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles the Ipuwer papyrus a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval is a famous example The Story of Sinuhe written in Middle Egyptian might be the classic of Egyptian literature Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of Near Eastern literature Towards the end of the New Kingdom the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces such as the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt From about 700 BC narrative stories and instructions such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian Many stories written in demotic during the GrecoRoman period were set in previous historical eras when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II Culture Daily life Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members and were constructed of mudbrick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day Each home had a kitchen with an open roof which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread Ceramics served as household wares for the storage preparation transport and consumption of food drink and raw materials Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings Floors were covered with reed mats while wooden stools beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs jewelry and cosmetics Children went without clothing until maturity at about age 12 and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children while the father provided the familys income Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them Early instruments included flutes and harps while instruments similar to trumpets oboes and pipes developed later and became popular In the New Kingdom the Egyptians played on bells cymbals tambourines drums and imported lutes and lyres from Asia The sistrum was a rattlelike musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities including games and music Senet a board game where pieces moved according to random chance was particularly popular from the earliest times another similar game was mehen which had a circular gaming board Hounds and Jackals also known as 58 holes is another example of board games played in ancient Egypt The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhat IV that dates to the 13th Dynasty Juggling and ball games were popular with children and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Beni Hasan The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting fishing and boating as well The excavation of the workers village of Deir elMedina has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world which spans almost four hundred years There is no comparable site in which the organization social interactions and working and living conditions of a community have been studied in such detail Cuisine Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time indeed the cuisine of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients The staple diet consisted of bread and beer supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic and fruit such as dates and figs Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis Fish meat and fowl could be salted or dried and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill Architecture The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes but also to reinforce the wideranging power of the pharaoh The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments architects could build large stone structures with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mudbricks and wood and have not survived Peasants lived in simple homes while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures A few surviving New Kingdom palaces such as those in Malkata and Amarna show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people birds water pools deities and geometric designs Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mudbricks The architectural elements used in the worlds first largescale stone building Djosers mortuary complex include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif The earliest preserved ancient Egyptian temples such as those at Giza consist of single enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns In the New Kingdom architects added the pylon the open courtyard and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temples sanctuary a style that was standard until the GrecoRoman period The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba a flatroofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber The step pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rockcut tombs The use of the pyramid form continued in private tomb chapels of the New Kingdom and in the royal pyramids of Nubia Art The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes For over 3500 years artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change These artistic standardssimple lines shapes and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depthcreated a sense of order and balance within a composition Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls coffins stelae and even statues The Narmer Palette for example displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores red and yellow ochres copper ores blue and green soot or charcoal black and limestone white Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes which could be moistened with water when needed Pharaohs used reliefs to record victories in battle royal decrees and religious scenes Common citizens had access to pieces of funerary art such as shabti statues and books of the dead which they believed would protect them in the afterlife During the Middle Kingdom wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife these models show laborers houses boats and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period Minoanstyle frescoes were found in Avaris The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna Period where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenatens revolutionary religious ideas This style known as Amarna art was quickly abandoned after Akhenatens death and replaced by the traditional forms Religious beliefs Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection However the gods were not always viewed as benevolent and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the kings behalf At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine Temples were not places of public worship or congregation and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship Normally the gods domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos After the New Kingdom the pharaohs role as a spiritual intermediary was deemphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods As a result priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or aspects In addition to the body each person had a wt shadow a ba personality or soul a ka lifeforce and a name The heart rather than the brain was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions After death the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will but they required the physical remains or a substitute such as a statue as a permanent home The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the blessed dead living on as an akh or effective one For this to happen the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial in which the heart was weighed against a feather of truth If deemed worthy the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form If they were not deemed worthy their heart was eaten by Ammit the Devourer and they were erased from the Universe Burial customs The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death These customs involved preserving the body by mummification performing burial ceremonies and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife Before the Old Kingdom bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation The arid desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification which involved removing the internal organs wrapping the body in linen and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars By the New Kingdom the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs removing the brain through the nose and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy which was decorated Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items but all burials regardless of social status included goods for the deceased Funerary texts were often included in the grave and beginning in the New Kingdom so were shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife Rituals in which the deceased was magically reanimated accompanied burials After burial living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased Military The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion and for maintaining Egypts domination in the ancient Near East The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes such as those found at the city of Buhen on the way to Nubia Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases such as the fortress at Sile which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant In the New Kingdom a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer Kush and parts of the Levant Typical military equipment included bows and arrows spears and roundtopped shields made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame In the New Kingdom the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle spears were tipped with a bronze point and the khopesh was adopted from Asiatic soldiers The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs such as Seqenenre Tao II and his sons did do so However it has also been argued that kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders fighting alongside their troops Soldiers were recruited from the general population but during and especially after the New Kingdom mercenaries from Nubia Kush and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt Technology medicine and mathematics Technology In technology medicine and mathematics ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication Traditional empiricism as evidenced by the Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri c 1600 BC is first credited to Egypt The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system Faience and glass Even before the Old Kingdom the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience which they treated as a type of artificial semiprecious stone Faience is a nonclay ceramic made of silica small amounts of lime and soda and a colorant typically copper The material was used to make beads tiles figurines and small wares Several methods can be used to create faience but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core which was then fired By a related technique the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian blue also called blue frit which is produced by fusing or sintering silica copper lime and an alkali such as natron The product can be ground up and used as a pigment The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported premade ingots which they melted and finished However they did have technical expertise in making objects as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass A range of colors could be produced including yellow red green blue purple and white and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque Medicine The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites which caused liver and intestinal damage Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body The grit and sand from stoneground flour abraded teeth leaving them susceptible to abscesses though caries were rare The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars which promoted periodontal disease Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence Adult life expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women but reaching adulthood was difficult as about onethird of the population died in infancy Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills and some such as Imhotep remained famous long after their deaths Herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians with some treating only the head or the stomach while others were eyedoctors and dentists Training of physicians took place at the Per Ankh or House of Life institution most notably those headquartered in PerBastet during the New Kingdom and at Abydos and Sas in the Late period Medical papyri show empirical knowledge of anatomy injuries and practical treatments Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat white linen sutures nets pads and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection while opium thyme and belladona were used to relieve pain The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies Prayers were made to the goddess Isis Moldy bread honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds set broken bones and amputated diseased limbs but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred Maritime technology Early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull and had mastered advanced forms of shipbuilding as early as 3000 BC The Archaeological Institute of America reports that the oldest planked ships known are the Abydos boats A group of 14 discovered ships in Abydos were constructed of wooden planks sewn together Discovered by Egyptologist David OConnor of New York University woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh Khasekhemwy originally they were all thought to have belonged to him but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating The ship dating to 3000 BC was 75 feet 23 m long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh perhaps one as early as HorAha Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together using pitch for caulking the seams The Khufu ship a 436metre 143 ft vessel sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC is a fullsize surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a solar barque Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints Large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean especially Byblos on the coast of modernday Lebanon and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the Land of Punt In fact one of the earliest Egyptian words for a seagoing ship is a Byblos Ship which originally defined a class of Egyptian seagoing ships used on the Byblos run however by the end of the Old Kingdom the term had come to include large seagoing ships whatever their destination In 1977 an ancient northsouth canal was discovered extending from Lake Timsah to the Ballah Lakes It was dated to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course In 2011 archaeologists from Italy the United States and Egypt excavating a driedup lagoon known as Mersa Gawasis unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages such as Hatshepsuts Punt expedition onto the open ocean Some of the sites most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes made from papyrus coiled in huge bundles In 2013 a team of FrancoEgyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the worlds oldest port dating back about 4500 years from the time of King Khufu on the Red Sea coast near Wadi elJarf about 110 miles south of Suez Mathematics The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic Naqada period and show a fully developed numeral system The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land labor and grain Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operationsaddition subtraction multiplication and divisionuse fractions calculate the areas of rectangles triangles and circles and compute the volumes of boxes columns and pyramids They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry and could solve systems of equations Mathematical notation was decimal and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number so to write the number eighty or eight hundred the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions For example they resolved the fraction twofifths into the sum of onethird onefifteenth Standard tables of values facilitated this Some common fractions however were written with a special glyphthe equivalent of the modern twothirds is shown on the right Ancient Egyptian mathematicians knew the Pythagorean theorem as an empirical formula They were aware for example that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a 345 ratio They were able to estimate the area of a circle by subtracting oneninth from its diameter and squaring the result Area 89D2 25681r2 316r2 a reasonable approximation of the formula r2 Population Estimates of the size of the population range from 115 million in the 3rd millennium BC to possibly 23 million by the 1st millennium BC before growing significantly towards the end of that millennium Archaeogenetics According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N Helft conflicting DNA analysis on recent genetic samples such as the Amarna royal mummies has led to a lack of consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins The genetic history of Ancient Egypt remains a developing field and is relevant for the understanding of population demographic events connecting Africa and Eurasia To date the amount of genomewide aDNA analyses on ancient specimens from Egypt and Sudan remain scarce although studies on uniparental haplogroups in ancient individuals have been carried out several times pointing broadly to affinities with other African and Eurasian groups The currently most advanced full genome analyses was made on three ancient specimens recovered from the Nile River Valley Abusir elMeleq Egypt Two of the individuals were dated to the PrePtolemaic Period New Kingdom to Late Period and one individual to the Ptolemaic Period spanning around 1300 years of Egyptian history These results point to a genetic continuity of Ancient Egyptians with modern Egyptians The results further point to a close genetic affinity between ancient Egyptians and Middle Eastern populations especially ancient groups from the Levant Ancient Egyptians also displayed affinities to Nubians to the south of Egypt in modernday Sudan Archaeological and historical evidence support interactions between Egyptian and Nubian populations more than 5000 years ago with sociopolitical dynamics between Egyptians and Nubians ranging from peaceful coexistence to variably successful attempts of conquest A study on sixtysix ancient Nubian individuals revealed significant contact with ancient Egyptians characterized by the presence of c 57 NeolithicBronze Age Levantine ancestry in these individuals Such geneflow of Levantinelike ancestry corresponds with archaeological and botanic evidence pointing to a Neolithic movement around 7000 years ago Modern Egyptians like modern Nubians also underwent subsequent admixture events contributing both SubSaharan Africanlike and West Asianlike ancestries since the Roman period with significance on the African Slave Trade and the Spread of Islam Some scholars such as Christopher Ehret caution that a wider sampling area is needed and argue that the current data is inconclusive on the origin of ancient Egyptians They also point out issues with the previously used methodology such as the sampling size comparative approach and a biased interpretation of the genetic data They argue in favor for a link between Ancient Egypt and the northern Horn of Africa This latter view has been attributed to the corresponding archaeological genetic linguistic and biological anthropological sources of evidence which broadly indicate that the earliest Egyptians and Nubians were the descendants of populations in northeast Africa Legacy The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world Egyptian civilization significantly influenced the Kingdom of Kush and Mero with both adopting Egyptian religious and architectural norms hundreds of pyramids 630 meters high were built in EgyptSudan as well as using Egyptian writing as the basis of the Meroitic script Meroitic is the oldest written language in Africa other than Egyptian and was used from the 2nd century BC until the early 5th century AD The cult of the goddess Isis for example became popular in the Roman Empire as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome The Romans also imported building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptianstyle structures Early historians such as Herodotus Strabo and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land which Romans came to view as a place of mystery During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as DhulNun alMisri and alMaqrizi In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe as evident in symbolism such as the Eye of Providence and the Great Seal of the United States This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt who took purchased or were given many important antiquities Napoleon arranged the first studies in Egyptology when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypts natural history which was published in the Description de lgypte In the 20th century the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations Since the 2010s the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has overseen excavations and the recovery of

    title: "Mayan civilization",
    originalContent:
      "The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization that existed from antiquity to the early modern period It is known by its ancient temples and glyphs script The Maya script is the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system in the preColumbian Americas The civilization is also noted for its art architecture mathematics calendar and astronomical system The Maya civilization developed in the Maya Region an area that today comprises southeastern Mexico all of Guatemala and Belize and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador It includes the northern lowlands of the Yucatn Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands of the Sierra Madre the Mexican state of Chiapas southern Guatemala El Salvador and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain Today their descendants known collectively as the Maya number well over 6 million individuals speak more than twentyeight surviving Mayan languages and reside in nearly the same area as their ancestors The Archaic period before 2000 BC saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages The Preclassic period c 2000 BC to 250 AD saw the establishment of the first complex societies in the Maya region and the cultivation of the staple crops of the Maya diet including maize beans squashes and chili peppers The first Maya cities developed around 750 BC and by 500 BC these cities possessed monumental architecture including large temples with elaborate stucco faades Hieroglyphic writing was being used in the Maya region by the 3rd century BC In the Late Preclassic a number of large cities developed in the Petn Basin and the city of Kaminaljuyu rose to prominence in the Guatemalan Highlands Beginning around 250 AD the Classic period is largely defined as when the Maya were raising sculpted monuments with Long Count dates This period saw the Maya civilization develop many citystates linked by a complex trade network In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals the cities of Tikal and Calakmul became powerful The Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan in Maya dynastic politics In the 9th century there was a widespread political collapse in the central Maya region resulting in civil wars the abandonment of cities and a northward shift of population The Postclassic period saw the rise of Chichen Itza in the north and the expansion of the aggressive Kiche kingdom in the Guatemalan Highlands In the 16th century the Spanish Empire colonised the Mesoamerican region and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of Nojpetn the last Maya city in 1697 Rule during the Classic period centred on the concept of the divine king who was thought to act as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm Kingship was usually but not exclusively patrilineal and power normally passed to the eldest son A prospective king was expected to be a successful war leader as well as a ruler Closed patronage systems were the dominant force in Maya politics although how patronage affected the political makeup of a kingdom varied from citystate to citystate By the Late Classic period the aristocracy had grown in size reducing the previously exclusive power of the king The Maya developed sophisticated art forms using both perishable and nonperishable materials including wood jade obsidian ceramics sculpted stone monuments stucco and finely painted murals Maya cities tended to expand organically The city centers comprised ceremonial and administrative complexes surrounded by an irregularly shaped sprawl of residential districts Different parts of a city were often linked by causeways Architecturally city buildings included palaces pyramidtemples ceremonial ballcourts and structures specially aligned for astronomical observation The Maya elite were literate and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing Theirs was the most advanced writing system in the preColumbian Americas The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books of which only three uncontested examples remain the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish In addition a great many examples of Maya texts can be found on stelae and ceramics The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest known instances of the explicit zero in human history As a part of their religion the Maya practised human sacrifice Etymology Maya is a modern term used to refer collectively to the various peoples that inhabited this area as Maya peoples have not had a sense of a common ethnic identity or political unity for the vast majority of their history Early Spanish and Mayanlanguage colonial sources in the Yucatn Peninsula used the term Maya to denote both the language spoken by the Yucatec Maya and the area surrounding the thenabandoned city of Mayapn The term Maya was derived from the city of Mayapn Some colonial Mayanlanguage sources also used Maya to refer to other Maya groups sometimes pejoratively in reference to Maya groups more resistant to Spanish rule Geography The Maya civilization occupied a wide territory that included southeastern Mexico and northern Central America This area included the entire Yucatn Peninsula and all of the territory now in the modern countries of Guatemala and Belize as well as the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline The territory of the Maya covered a third of Mesoamerica and the Maya were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the Olmecs Mixtecs Teotihuacan and Aztecs During the Early Classic period the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended into the highlands of central Mexico there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant Toltec capital of Tula had an especially close relationship The Petn region consists of densely forested lowlying limestone plain a chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Petn To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands The dense Maya forest covers northern Petn and Belize most of Quintana Roo southern Campeche and a portion of the south of Yucatn state Farther north the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub The littoral zone of Soconusco lies to the south of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes Their major preColumbian population centres were in the largest highland valleys such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley In the southern highlands a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz and gradually descend to the east History The history of Maya civilization is divided into three principal periods the Preclassic Classic and Postclassic These were preceded by the Archaic Period during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century depending on the author Preclassic period c 2000 BC 250 AD The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began Maya occupation at Cuello modern Belize has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize beans squash and chili pepper This period was characterised by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines During the Middle Preclassic Period small villages began to grow to form cities Nakbe in the Petn department of Guatemala is the earliest welldocumented city in the Maya lowlands where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC The northern lowlands of Yucatn were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic By approximately 400 BC early Maya rulers were raising stelae A developed script was already being used in Petn by the 3rd century BC In the Late Preclassic Period the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres 62 sq mi Although not as large Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC In the highlands Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic Takalik Abaj and Chocol were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatn The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned the cause of this collapse is unknown Classic period c 250900 AD The Classic period is largely defined as the period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar This period marked the peak of largescale construction and urbanism the recording of monumental inscriptions and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development particularly in the southern lowland regions The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of Renaissance Italy or Classical Greece with multiple citystates engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities The largest cities had 50000 to 120000 people and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites During the Early Classic cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico In AD 378 Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities deposed their rulers and installed a new Teotihuacanbacked dynasty This intervention was led by Siyaj Kak Born of Fire who arrived at Tikal in early 378 The king of Tikal Chak Tok Ichaak I died on the same day suggesting a violent takeover A year later Siyaj Kak oversaw the installation of a new king Yax Nuun Ahiin I This led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands Tikals great rival was Calakmul another powerful city in the Petn Basin Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive systems of allies and vassals lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the toptier city and maintained peaceful relations with members of the network Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other At various points during the Classic period one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline In 629 Balaj Chan Kawiil a son of the Tikal king Kinich Muwaan Jol II was sent to found a new city at Dos Pilas in the Petexbatn region apparently as an outpost to extend Tikals power beyond the reach of Calakmul For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal In 648 king Yuknoom Cheen II of Calakmul captured Balaj Chan Kawiil Yuknoom Cheen II then reinstated Balaj Chan Kawiil upon the throne of Dos Pilas as his vassal He thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul In the southeast Copn was the most important city Its Classicperiod dynasty was founded in 426 by Kinich Yax Kuk Mo The new king had strong ties with central Petn and Teotihuacan Copn reached the height of its cultural and artistic development during the rule of Uaxaclajuun Ubaah Kawiil who ruled from 695 to 738 His reign ended catastrophically when he was captured by his vassal king Kak Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quirigu The captured lord of Copn was taken back to Quirigu and was decapitated in a public ritual It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal Palenque and Yaxchilan were the most powerful cities in the Usumacinta region In the highlands Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by 300 In the north of the Maya area Coba was the most important capital Classic Maya collapse During the 9th century AD the central Maya region suffered major political collapse marked by the abandonment of cities the ending of dynasties and a northward shift in activity No universally accepted theory explains this collapse but it likely had a combination of causes including endemic internecine warfare overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation and drought During this period known as the Terminal Classic the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal showed increased activity Major cities in the northern Yucatn Peninsula were inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments Classic Maya social organization was based on the ritual authority of the ruler rather than central control of trade and food distribution This model was poorly structured to respond to changes because the rulers actions were limited by tradition to such activities as construction ritual and warfare This only served to exacerbate systemic problems By the 9th and 10th centuries this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership In the northern Yucatn individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages In the southern Yucatn and central Petn kingdoms declined in western Petn and some other areas the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities Within a couple of generations large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years One by one cities stopped sculpting dated monuments the last Long Count date was inscribed at Tonin in 909 Stelae were no longer raised and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petn Postclassic period c 9501539 AD Although much reduced a significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources Unlike during previous cycles of contraction abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse After the decline of Chichen Itza the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of Mayapan in the 12th century New cities arose near the Caribbean and Gulf coasts and new trade networks were formed The Postclassic Period was marked by changes from the preceding Classic Period The oncegreat city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2000 years Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast longoccupied cities in exposed locations were relocated apparently due to a proliferation of warfare Cities came to occupy moreeasily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines with ditchandwall defences sometimes supplementing the natural terrain One of the most important cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was Qumarkaj the capital of the aggressive Kiche kingdom The government of Maya states from the Yucatn to the Guatemalan highlands was often organised as joint rule by a council However in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler while the other members served him as advisors Mayapan was abandoned around 1448 after a period of political social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the southern Maya region The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare disease and natural disasters in the Yucatn Peninsula which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511 Even without a dominant regional capital the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces During the Late Postclassic the Yucatn Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization On the eve of the Spanish conquest the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states The Kiche had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain However in the decades before the Spanish conquest of the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the Kiche Contact period and Spanish conquest 15111697 AD In 1511 a Spanish caravel was wrecked in the Caribbean and about a dozen survivors made landfall on the coast of Yucatn They were seized by a Maya lord and most were sacrificed although two escaped From 1517 to 1519 three separate Spanish expeditions explored the Yucatn coast and engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish in 1521 Hernn Corts despatched Pedro de Alvarado to Guatemala with 180 cavalry 300 infantry 4 cannons and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico they arrived in Soconusco in 1523 The Kiche capital Qumarkaj fell to Alvarado in 1524 Shortly afterwards the Spanish were invited as allies into Iximche the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya Good relations did not last due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute and the city was abandoned a few months later This was followed by the fall of Zaculeu the Mam Maya capital in 1525 Francisco de Montejo and his son Francisco de Montejo the Younger launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the Yucatn Peninsula in 1527 and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546 This left only the Maya kingdoms of the Petn Basin independent In 1697 Martn de Ursa launched an assault on the Itza capital Nojpetn and the last independent Maya city fell to the Spanish Persistence of Maya culture The Spanish conquest stripped away most of the defining features of Maya civilization However many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority and for the most part continued to manage their own affairs Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional daytoday life The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools Traditional crafts such as weaving ceramics and basketry continued to be practised Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest At times the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles although these were usually made to European specifications Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries The 260day tzolkin ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas and millions of Mayanlanguage speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization Investigation of Maya civilization The agents of the Catholic Church wrote detailed accounts of the Maya in support of their efforts at Christianization and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatn and Central America In 1839 American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest and brought the Maya to world attention The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of the Maya and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs The final two decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern scientific archaeology in the Maya region with the meticulous work of Alfred Maudslay and Teoberto Maler By the early 20th century the Peabody Museum was sponsoring excavations at Copn and in the Yucatn Peninsula In the first two decades of the 20th century advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar and identifying deities dates and religious concepts Since the 1930s archaeological exploration increased dramatically with largescale excavations across the Maya region In the 1960s Mayanist J Eric S Thompson promoted the ideas that Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomerpriests These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century pioneered by Heinrich Berlin Tatiana Proskouriakoff and Yuri Knorozov With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings undermining the view of the Maya as peaceful Politics Unlike the Aztecs and the Inca the Maya political system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area into a single state or empire Rather throughout its history the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both states and chiefdoms These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships with each other and were engaged in a complex web of rivalries periods of dominance or submission vassalage and alliances At times different polities achieved regional dominance such as Calakmul Caracol Mayapan and Tikal The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC During the Late Preclassic the Maya political system coalesced into a theopolitical form where elite ideology justified the rulers authority and was reinforced by public display ritual and religion The divine king was the centre of political power exercising ultimate control over administrative economic judicial and military functions The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects apparently with no police force or standing army Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives Within a polity midranking population centres would have played a key role in managing resources and internal conflict The Maya political landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain economic and social advantage over neighbours In the Late Classic some cities established a long period of dominance over other large cities such as the dominance of Caracol over Naranjo for half a century In other cases loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city Border settlements usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals often switched allegiance over the course of their history and at times acted independently Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres Political power was reinforced by military power and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities Society From the Early Preclassic Maya society was sharply divided between the elite and commoners As population increased over time various sectors of society became increasingly specialised and political organization increasingly complex By the Late Classic when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies the wealthy segment of society multiplied A middle class may have developed that included artisans low ranking priests and officials merchants and soldiers Commoners included farmers servants labourers and slaves According to indigenous histories land was held communally by noble houses or clans Such clans held that the land was the property of the ancestors and ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds King and court Classic Maya rule was centred in a royal culture that was displayed in all areas of Classic Maya art The king was the supreme ruler and held a semidivine status that made him the mediator between the mortal realm and that of the gods From very early times kings were specifically identified with the young maize god whose gift of maize was the basis of Mesoamerican civilization Maya royal succession was patrilineal and royal power only passed to queens when doing otherwise would result in the extinction of the dynasty Typically power was passed to the eldest son A young prince was called a chok youth although this word later came to refer to nobility in general The royal heir was called baah chok head youth Various points in the princes childhood were marked by ritual the most important was a bloodletting ceremony at age five or six Although being of the royal bloodline was of utmost importance the heir also had to be a successful war leader as demonstrated by taking of captives The enthronement of a new king was a highly elaborate ceremony involving a series of separate acts that included enthronement upon a jaguarskin cushion human sacrifice and receiving the symbols of royal power such as a headband bearing a jade representation of the socalled jester god an elaborate headdress adorned with quetzal feathers and a sceptre representing the god Kawiil Maya political administration based around the royal court was not bureaucratic in nature Government was hierarchical and official posts were sponsored by higherranking members of the aristocracy officials tended to be promoted to higher levels of office over their lives Officials are referred to as being owned by their sponsor and this relationship continued even after the death of the sponsor The Maya royal court was a vibrant and dynamic political institution There was no universal structure for the Maya royal court instead each polity formed a royal court that was suited to its own individual context A number of royal and noble titles have been identified by epigraphers translating Classic Maya inscriptions Ajaw is usually translated as lord or king In the Early Classic an ajaw was the ruler of a city Later with increasing social complexity the ajaw was a member of the ruling class and a major city could have more than one each ruling over different districts Paramount rulers distinguished themselves from the extended nobility by prefixing the word kuhul to their ajaw title A kuhul ajaw was divine lord originally confined to the kings of the most prestigious and ancient royal lines Kalomte was a royal title whose exact meaning is not yet deciphered but it was held only by the most powerful kings of the strongest dynasties It indicated an overlord or high king and was only in use during the Classic period By the Late Classic the absolute power of the kuhul ajaw had weakened and the political system had diversified to include a wider aristocracy that by this time may well have expanded disproportionately A sajal was ranked below the ajaw and indicated a subservient lord A sajal would be lord of a second or thirdtier site answering to an ajaw who may himself have been subservient to a kalomte A sajal would often be a war captain or regional governor and inscriptions often link the sajal title to warfare they are often mentioned as the holders of war captives Sajal meant feared one The titles of ah tzihb and ah chul hun are both related to scribes The ah tzihb was a royal scribe usually a member of the royal family the ah chul hun was the Keeper of the Holy Books a title that is closely associated with the ajaw title indicating that an ajaw always held the ah chul hun title simultaneously Other courtly titles the functions of which are not well understood were yajaw kahk Lord of Fire tihuun and tisakhuun These last two may be variations on the same title and Mark Zender has suggested that the holder of this title may have been the spokesman for the ruler Courtly titles are overwhelmingly maleoriented and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty Titled elites were often associated with particular structures in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Classic period cities indicating that such office holders either owned that structure or that the structure was an important focus for their activities A lakam or standardbearer was possibly the only nonelite postholder in the royal court The lakam was only found in larger sites and they appear to have been responsible for the taxation of local districts Different factions may have existed in the royal court The kuhul ahaw and his household would have formed the central powerbase but other important groups were the priesthood the warrior aristocracy and other aristocratic courtiers Where ruling councils existed as at Chichen Itza and Copn these may have formed an additional faction Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out In such a setting public performance was vital Such performances included ritual dances presentation of war captives offerings of tribute human sacrifice and religious ritual Commoners Commoners are estimated to have comprised over 90 of the population but relatively little is known about them Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms and these can be identified but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not Such lowstatus dwellings can only be detected by extensive remotesensing surveys of apparently empty terrain The range of commoners was broad it consisted of everyone not of noble birth and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions Commoners engaged in essential production activities including that of products destined for use by the elite such as cotton and cacao as well as subsistence crops for their own use and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools Commoners took part in warfare and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game It is likely that hardworking commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society Warfare Warfare was prevalent in the Maya world Military campaigns were launched for a variety of reasons including the control of trade routes and tribute raids to take captives scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state Little is known about Maya military organization logistics or training Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions Unfortunately the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war or the form it took In the 8th9th centuries intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatn region of western Petn The rapid abandonment of Aguateca by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry in situ Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured and never returned to collect their abandoned property The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to eliminate a Maya state rather than subjugate it Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite From as early as the Preclassic period the ruler of a Maya polity was expected to be a distinguished war leader and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt In the Classic period such trophy heads no longer appeared on the kings belt but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives Right up to the end of the Postclassic period Maya kings led as war captains Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured tortured and sacrificed The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books The outcome of a successful military campaign could vary in its impact on the defeated polity In some cases entire cities were sacked and never resettled as at Aguateca In other instances the victors would seize the defeated rulers their families and patron gods The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned or sacrificed At the least severe end of the scale the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor Warriors During the Contact period certain military positions were held by members of the aristocracy and were passed on by patrilineal succession It is likely that the specialised knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor including strategy ritual and war dances Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills every ablebodied adult male was available for military service Maya states did not maintain standing armies warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders There were also units of fulltime mercenaries who followed permanent leaders Most warriors were not fulltime however and were primarily farmers the needs of their crops usually came before warfare Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder There is some evidence from the Classic period that women provided supporting roles in war but they did not act as military officers with the exception of those rare ruling queens By the Postclassic the native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle Weapons The atlatl spearthrower was introduced to the Maya region by Teotihuacan in the Early Classic This was a 05metrelong 16 ft stick with a notched end to hold a dart or javelin The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than simply hurling it with the arm Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior Commoners used blowguns in war which also served as their hunting weapon The bow and arrow was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period its use as a weapon of war was not favoured it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic The Contact period Maya also used twohanded swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian similar to the Aztec macuahuitl Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins Trade Trade was a key component of Maya society and in the development of the Maya civilization The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods or portage routes Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Qumarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands and Chalchuapa in El Salvador variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history The Maya were major producers of cotton which was used to make the textiles to be traded throughout Mesoamerica The most important cities in the northern Yucatn Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt In the Postclassic the Maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider Mesoamerica The Maya engaged in longdistance trade across the Maya region and across greater Mesoamerica and beyond As an illustration an Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in central Mexico Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast In the Early Classic Chichen Itza was at the hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from Colombia and Panama and turquoise from Los Cerrillos New Mexico Longdistance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the citys ruler and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies Trade routes not only supplied physical goods they facilitated the movement of people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica Shifts in trade routes occurred with the rise and fall of important cities in the Maya region and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization the transition to the Classic and the Terminal Classic collapse Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity for example the Contact period Manche Chol traded the prestige crops of cacao annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz Merchants Little is known of Maya merchants although they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress so at least some were members of the elite During the Contact period Maya nobility took part in longdistance trading expeditions The majority of traders were middle class but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious longdistance trading that was the preserve of the elite The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the underworld the patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks When merchants travelled they painted themselves black like their patron gods and went heavily armed The Maya had no pack animals so all trade goods were carried on the backs of porters when going overland if the trade route followed a river or the coast then goods were transported in canoes A substantial Maya trading canoe made from a large hollowedout tree trunk was encountered off Honduras on Christopher Columbuss fourth voyage The canoe was 25 metres 82 ft broad and was powered by 25 rowers Trade goods carried included cacao obsidian ceramics textiles and copper bells and axes Cacao was used as currency although not exclusively and its value was such that counterfeiting occurred by removing the flesh from the pod and stuffing it with dirt or avocado rind Marketplaces Marketplaces are difficult to identify archaeologically However the Spanish reported a thriving market economy when they arrived in the region At some Classic period cities archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcadestyle masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls A 2007 study compared soils from a modern Guatemalan market to a proposed ancient market at Chunchucmil unusually high levels of zinc and phosphorus at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at an increasing number of Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis When the Spanish arrived Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas with officials on hand to settle disputes enforce rules and collect taxes Art Maya art is essentially the art of the royal court It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world Maya art was crafted from both perishable and nonperishable materials and served to link the Maya to their ancestors Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas Maya art has many regional styles and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period The Maya exhibited a preference for the colour green or bluegreen and used the same word for the colours blue and green Correspondingly they placed high value on applegreen jade and other greenstones associating them with the sungod Kinich Ajau They sculpted artefacts that included fine tesserae and beads to carved heads weighing 442 kilograms 97 lb The Maya nobility practised dental modification and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth Mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade such as that of Kinich Janaab Pakal king of Palenque Maya stone sculpture emerged into the archaeological record as a fully developed tradition suggesting that it may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood Because of the biodegradability of wood the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared The few wooden artefacts that have survived include threedimensional sculptures and hieroglyphic panels Stone Maya stelae are widespread in city sites often paired with low circular stones referred to as altars in the literature Stone sculpture also took other forms such as the limestone relief panels at Palenque and Piedras Negras At Yaxchilan Dos Pilas Copn and other sites stone stairways were decorated with sculpture The hieroglyphic stairway at Copn comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text and consists of 2200 individual glyphs The largest Maya sculptures consisted of architectural faades crafted from stucco The rough form was laid out on a plain plaster base coating on the wall and the threedimensional form was built up using small stones Finally this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form human body forms were first modelled in stucco with their costumes added afterwards The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple faades by the Late Preclassic and such decoration continued into the Classic period The Maya had a long tradition of mural painting rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo dating to between 300 and 200 BC Walls were coated with plaster and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish The majority of such murals have not survived but Early Classic tombs painted in cream red and black have been excavated at Caracol Ro Azul and Tikal Among the best preserved murals are a fullsize series of Late Classic paintings at Bonampak Flint chert and obsidian all served utilitarian purposes in Maya culture but many pieces were finely crafted into forms that were never intended to be used as tools Eccentric flints are among the finest lithic artefacts produced by the ancient Maya They were technically very challenging to produce requiring considerable skill on the part of the artisan Large obsidian eccentrics can measure over 30 centimetres 12 in in length Their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human animal and geometric forms associated with Maya religion Eccentric flints show a great variety of forms such as crescents crosses snakes and scorpions The largest and most elaborate examples display multiple human heads with minor heads sometimes branching off from larger one Maya textiles are very poorly represented in the archaeological record although by comparison with other preColumbian cultures such as the Aztecs and the Andean region it is likely that they were highvalue items Scraps of textile have been recovered but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media such as painted murals or ceramics Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths generally these would have been cotton but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown Ceramics are the most commonly surviving type of Maya art The Maya had no knowledge of the potters wheel and Maya vessels were built up by coiling rolled strips of clay into the desired form Maya pottery was not glazed although it often had a fine finish produced by burnishing Maya ceramics were painted with clay slips blended with minerals and coloured clays Ancient Maya firing techniques have yet to be replicated A quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from Late Classic tombs on Jaina Island in northern Yucatn They stand from 10 to 25 centimetres 39 to 98 in high and were hand modelled with exquisite detail The Ikstyle polychrome ceramic corpus including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels originated in Late Classic Motul de San Jos It includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petn region in the 8th century AD such as diplomatic meetings feasting bloodletting scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war Bone both human and animal was also sculpted human bones may have been trophies or relics of ancestors The Maya valued Spondylus shells and worked them to remove the white exterior and spines to reveal the fine orange interior Around the 10th century AD metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America and the Maya began to make small objects in gold silver and copper The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads bells and discs In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest the Maya began to use the lostwax method to cast small metal pieces One poorly studied area of Maya folk art is graffiti Additional graffiti not part of the planned decoration was incised into the stucco of interior walls floors and benches in a wide variety of buildings including temples residences and storerooms Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites particularly clustered in the Petn Basin and southern Campeche and the Chenes region of northwestern Yucatn At Tikal where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded the subject matter includes drawings of temples people deities animals banners litters and thrones Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly with drawings overlapping each other and display a mix of crude untrained art and examples by artists familiar with Classicperiod artistic conventions Architecture The Maya produced a vast array of structures and have left an extensive architectural legacy Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialization in Maya society centralised organization and the political means to mobilize a large workforce It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copn required an estimated 10686 mandays to build which compares to 67mandays for a commoners hut It is further estimated that 65 of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying transporting and finishing of the stone used in construction and 24 of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestonebased plaster Altogether it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copn using between 80 and 130 fulltime labourers A Classicperiod city like Tikal was spread over 20 square kilometres 77 sq mi with an urban core covering 6 square kilometres 23 sq mi The labour required to build such a city was immense running into many millions of mandays The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period Craft specialization would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by the Late Preclassic and would have required planners and architects Urban design Maya cities were not formally planned and were subject to irregular expansion with the haphazard addition of palaces temples and other buildings Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty City centres also featured plazas sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city which served as sacred centres for nonroyal lineages The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art The ceremonial centre of the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived and where the administrative functions of the city were performed together with religious ceremonies It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters Building materials and methods The Maya built their cities with Neolithic technology they built their structures from both perishable materials and from stone The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources and this also affected the building style Across a broad swathe of the Maya area limestone was immediately available The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut but hardens with exposure There was great variety in the quality of limestone with goodquality stone available in the Usumacinta region in the northern Yucatn the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality Volcanic tuff was used at Copn and nearby Quirigu employed sandstone In Comalcalco where suitable stone was not available locally fired bricks were employed Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement plaster and stucco Limebased cement was used to seal stonework in place and stone blocks were fashioned using ropeandwater abrasion and with obsidian tools The Maya did not employ a functional wheel so all loads were transported on litters barges or rolled on logs Heavy loads were lifted with rope but probably without employing pulleys Wood was used for beams and for lintels even in masonry structures Throughout Maya history common huts and some temples continued to be built from wooden poles and thatch Adobe was also applied this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the wovenstick walls of huts even after the development of masonry structures In the southern Maya area adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available Principal construction types The great cities of the Maya civilization were composed of pyramid temples palaces ballcourts sacbeob causeways patios and plazas Some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls The exteriors of most buildings were painted either in one or multiple colours or with imagery Many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs Palaces and acropoleis These complexes were usually located in the site core beside a principal plaza Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure The term acropolis in a Maya context refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds They generally extended horizontally as opposed to the towering Maya pyramids and often had restricted access Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported roof combs Rooms often had stone benches for sleeping and holes indicate where curtains once hung Large palaces such as at Palenque could be fitted with a water supply and sweat baths were often found within the complex or nearby During the Early Classic rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms in the royal palace of Palenque there were a number of throne rooms that were used for important events including the inauguration of new kings Palaces are usually arranged around one or more courtyards with their faades facing inwards some examples are adorned with sculpture Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences and that a range of courtly activities took place in them including audiences formal receptions and important rituals Pyramids and temples Temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as kuh nah meaning gods house Temples were raised on platforms most often upon a pyramid The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms By the Late Preclassic period their walls were of stone and the development of the corbel arch allowed stone roofs to replace thatch By the Classic period temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art Temple shrines contained one to three rooms and were dedicated to important deities Such a deity might be one of the patron gods of the city or a deified ancestor In general freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors EGroups and observatories The Maya were keen observers of the sun stars and planets EGroups were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region they take their names from Group E at Uaxactun They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure and were used to mark the solstices and equinoxes The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period The Lost World complex at Tikal started out as an EGroup built towards the end of the Middle Preclassic Due to its nature the basic layout of an EGroup was constant A structure was built on the west side of a plaza it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side From the west pyramid the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and equinoxes EGroups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium not all were properly aligned as observatories and their function may have been symbolic As well as EGroups the Maya built other structures dedicated to observing the movements of celestial bodies Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies including the planet Venus and various constellations The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multilevel edifice with a conical superstructure It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus At Copn a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position of the setting sun at the equinoxes Triadic pyramids Triadic pyramids first appeared in the Preclassic They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inwardfacing buildings all mounted upon a single basal platform The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petn Basin it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV the largest pyramid at Tikal The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known but they may have developed from the eastern range building of EGroup complexes The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petn region during the Late Preclassic Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites At Nakbe there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures Examples of the triadic form are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the far north of the Yucatn Peninsula and Qumarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built it continued in use into the Classic Period with later examples being found at Uaxactun Caracol Seibal Nakum Tikal and Palenque The Qumarkaj example is the only one that has been dated to the Postclassic Period The tripletemple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology Ballcourts The ballcourt is a distinctive panMesoamerican form of architecture Although the majority of Maya ballcourts date to the Classic period the earliest examples appeared around 1000 BC in northwestern Yucatn during the Middle Preclassic By the time of Spanish contact ballcourts were only in use in the Guatemalan Highlands at cities such as Qumarkaj and Iximche Throughout Maya history ballcourts maintained a characteristic form consisting of an shape with a central playing area terminating in two transverse end zones The central playing area usually measures between 20 and 30 metres 66 and 98 ft long and is flanked by two lateral structures that stood up to 3 or 4 metres 98 or 131 ft high The lateral platforms often supported structures that may have held privileged spectators The Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza is the largest in Mesoamerica measuring 83 metres 272 ft long by 30 metres 98 ft wide with walls standing 82 metres 27 ft high Regional architectural styles Although Maya cities shared many common features there was considerable variation in architectural style Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials climate topography and local preferences In the Late Classic these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles Central Petn The central Petn style of architecture is modelled after the great city of Tikal The style is characterised by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb and accessed by a single doorway Additional features are the use of stelaaltar pairings and the decoration of architectural faades lintels and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods One of the finest examples of Central Petn style architecture is Tikal Temple I Examples of sites in the Central Petn style include Altun Ha Calakmul Holmul Ixkun Nakum Naranjo and Yaxh Puuc The exemplar of Puucstyle architecture is Uxmal The style developed in the Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatn during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatn Peninsula Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement resulting in stronger walls and also strengthened their corbel arches this allowed Puucstyle cities to build freestanding entrance archways The upper faades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaicfashion erected as facing over the core forming elaborate compositions of longnosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity The motifs also included geometric patterns lattices and spools possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca outside the Maya area In contrast the lower faades were left undecorated Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites Chenes The Chenes style is very similar to the Puuc style but predates the use of the mosaic faades of the Puuc region It featured fully adorned faades on both the upper and lower sections of structures Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatn Peninsula although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula Examples of Chenes sites include Dzibilnocac Hochob Santa Rosa Xtampak and Tabasqueo Ro Bec The Ro Bec style forms a subregion of the Chenes style and also features elements of the Central Petn style such as prominent roof combs Its palaces are distinctive for their falsetower decorations lacking interior rooms with steep almost vertical stairways and false doors These towers were adorned with deity masks and were built to impress the viewer rather than serve any practical function Such false towers are only found in the Ro Bec region Ro Bec sites include Chicann Hormiguero and Xpuhil Usumacinta The Usumacinta style developed in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage Cities took advantage of the hillsides to support their major architecture as at Palenque and Yaxchilan Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples As in Petn roof combs adorned principal structures Palaces had multiple entrances that used postandlintel entrances rather than corbel vaulting Many sites erected stelae but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings Language Before 2000 BC the Maya spoke a single language dubbed protoMayan by linguists Linguistic analysis of reconstructed ProtoMayan vocabulary suggests that the original ProtoMayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands although the evidence is not conclusive ProtoMayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups that make up the family including Huastecan Greater Kichean Greater Qanjobalan Mamean TzeltalanCholan and Yucatecan These groups diverged further during the preColumbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as Cholan Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu in the highlands also appears to be in or related to Cholan The use of Cholan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace it may have been equivalent to Medieval Latin as a ritual or prestige language Classic Cholan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite used in interpolity communication such as diplomacy and trade By the Postclassic period Yucatec was also being written in Maya codices alongside Cholan Writing and literacy The Maya writing system is one of the outstanding achievements of the preColumbian inhabitants of the Americas It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system of more than a dozen systems that developed in Mesoamerica The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300200 BC in the Petn Basin However this is preceded by several other Mesoamerican writing systems such as the EpiOlmec and Zapotec scripts Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD or early 2nd century Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem By about AD 250 the Maya script had become a more formalised and consistent writing system The Catholic Church and colonial officials notably Bishop Diego de Landa destroyed Maya texts wherever they found them and with them the knowledge of Maya writing but by chance four uncontested preColumbian books dated to the Postclassic period have been preserved These are known as the Madrid Codex the Dresden Codex the Paris Codex and the Maya Codex of Mexico previously known as the Grolier Codex which was of disputed authenticity until 2018 Archaeology conducted at Maya sites often reveals other fragments rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which were codices these tantalizing remains are however too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived most of the organic material having decayed In reference to the few extant Maya writings Michael D Coe stated Our knowledge of ancient Maya thought must represent only a tiny fraction of the whole picture for of the thousands of books in which the full extent of their learning and ritual was recorded only four have survived to modern times as though all that posterity knew of ourselves were to be based upon three prayer books and Pilgrims Progress Most surviving preColumbian Maya writing dates to the Classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from Maya sites such as stelae or on ceramics vessels Other media include the aforementioned codices stucco faades frescoes wooden lintels cave walls and portable artefacts crafted from a variety of materials including bone shell obsidian and jade Writing system The Maya writing system often called hieroglyphs from a superficial resemblance to Ancient Egyptian writing is a logosyllabic writing system combining a syllabary of phonetic signs representing syllables with logogram representing entire words Among the writing systems of the PreColumbian New World Maya script most closely represents the spoken language At any one time no more than around 500 glyphs were in use some 200 of which including variations were phonetic The Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans its use peaking during the Classic Period In excess of 10000 individual texts have been recovered mostly inscribed on stone monuments lintels stelae and ceramics The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed treebark generally now known by its Nahuatllanguage name amatl used to produce codices The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest The knowledge was subsequently lost as a result of the impact of the conquest on Maya society The decipherment and recovery of the knowledge of Maya writing has been a long and laborious process Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century mostly the parts having to do with numbers the Maya calendar and astronomy Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s and accelerated rapidly thereafter By the end of the 20th century scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content Logosyllabic script The basic unit of Maya logosyllabic text is the glyph block which transcribes a word or phrase The block is composed of one or more individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern For ease of reference epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically and top to bottom numerically Thus any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified C4 would be third block counting from the left and the fourth block counting downwards If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription column labels are not repeated rather they continue in the alphabetic series if there are more than 26 columns the labelling continues as A B etc Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text Although Mayan text may be laid out in varying manners generally it is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks The reading order of text starts at the top left block A1 continues to the second block in the doublecolumn B1 then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column A2 and thus continues in zigzag fashion Once the bottom is reached the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column C1 Where an inscription ends in a single unpaired column this final column is usually read straight downwards Individual glyph blocks may be composed of a number of elements These consist of the main sign and any affixes Main signs represent the major element of the block and may be a noun verb adverb adjective or phonetic sign Some main signs are abstract some are pictures of the object they represent and others are head variants personifications of the word they represent Affixes are smaller rectangular elements usually attached to a main sign although a block may be composed entirely of affixes Affixes may represent a wide variety of speech elements including nouns verbs verbal suffixes prepositions and pronouns Small sections of a main sign could be used to represent the whole main sign Maya scribes were highly inventive in their usage and adaptation of glyph elements Writing tools Although the archaeological record does not provide examples of brushes or pens analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair A Classic period sculpture from Copn Honduras depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes including palettes and mortars and pestles Scribes and literacy Commoners were illiterate scribes were drawn from the elite It is not known if all members of the aristocracy could read and write although at least some women could since there are representations of female scribes in Maya art Maya scribes were called aj tzib meaning one who writes or paints There were probably scribal schools where members of the aristocracy were taught to write Scribal activity is identifiable in the archaeological record Jasaw Chan Kawiil I king of Tikal was interred with his paint pot Some junior members of the Copn royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements A palace at Copn has been identified as that of a noble lineage of scribes it is decorated with sculpture that includes figures holding ink pots Although not much is known about Maya scribes some did sign their work both on ceramics and on stone sculpture Usually only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel but multiple sculptors are known to have recorded their names on stone sculpture eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras However most works remained unsigned by their artists Mathematics In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations the Maya used a base 20 vigesimal system The baranddot counting system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic and added the symbol for zero This may have been the earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide although it may have been later than the Babylonian system The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD In its earliest uses the zero served as a place holder indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count This later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years until the writing system was extinguished by the Spanish The basic number system consists of a dot to represent one and a bar to represent five By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero during the Classic period other glyphs were used The Maya numerals from 0 to 19 used repetitions of these symbols The value of a numeral was determined by its position as a numeral shifted upwards its basic value multiplied by twenty In this way the lowest symbol would represent units the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400 and so on For example the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level four dots on the next level up and two dots on the next level after that to give 41 420 2400 884 Using this system the Maya were able to record huge numbers Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column Calendar The Maya calendrical system in common with other Mesoamerican calendars had its origins in the Preclassic period However it was the Maya that developed the calendar to its maximum sophistication recording lunar and solar cycles eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy In some cases the Maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the Old World for example the Maya solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than the Julian year The Maya calendar was intrinsically tied to Maya ritual and it was central to Maya religious practices The calendar combined a nonrepeating Long Count with three interlocking cycles each measuring a progressively larger period These were the 260day tzolkin the 365day haab and the 52year Calendar Round resulting from the combination of the tzolkin with the haab There were also additional calendric cycles such as an 819day cycle associated with the four quadrants of Maya cosmology governed by four different aspects of the god Kawiil The basic unit in the Maya calendar was one day or kin and 20 kin grouped to form a winal The next unit instead of being multiplied by 20 as called for by the vigesimal system was multiplied by 18 in order to provide a rough approximation of the solar year hence producing 360 days This 360day year was called a tun Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system The 260day tzolkin provided the basic cycle of Maya ceremony and the foundations of Maya prophecy No astronomical basis for this count has been proved and it may be that the 260day count is based on the human gestation period This is reinforced by the use of the tzolkin to record dates of birth and provide corresponding prophecy The 260day cycle repeated a series of 20daynames with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred The 365day haab was produced by a cycle of eighteen named 20day winals completed by the addition of a 5day period called the wayeb The wayeb was considered to be a dangerous time when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns In a similar way to the tzolkin the named winal would be prefixed by a number from 0 to 19 in the case of the shorter wayeb period the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4 Since each day in the tzolkin had a name and number eg 8 Ajaw this would interlock with the haab producing an additional number and name to give any day a more complete designation for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years and this period is referred to by Mayanists as the Calendar Round In most Mesoamerican cultures the Calendar Round was the largest unit for measuring time As with any nonrepeating calendar the Maya measured time from a fixed start point The Maya set the beginning of their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of baktuns equivalent to a day in 3114 BC This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 baktuns There was some variation in the calendar specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 baktuns but others used a cycle of 13 20 baktun in the current piktun Additionally there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed A full long count date consisted of an introductory glyph followed by five glyphs counting off the number of baktuns katuns tuns winals and kins since the start of the current creation This would be followed by the tzolkin portion of the Calendar Round date and after a number of intervening glyphs the Long Count date would end with the Haab portion of the Calendar Round date Correlation of the Long Count calendar Although the Calendar Round is still in use today the Maya started using an abbreviated Short Count during the Late Classic period The Short Count is a count of 13 katuns The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel contains the only colonial reference to classic longcount dates The most generally accepted correlation is the GoodmanMartnezThompson or GMT correlation This equates the Long Count date 1116000 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the Gregorian date of 12 November 1539 Epigraphers Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube argue for a twoday shift from the standard GMT correlation The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years it also accords with the documentary evidence and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatn Peninsula but presents problems with the rest of the Maya region The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period Radiocarbon dating of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation Astronomy The famous astrologer John Dee used an Aztec obsidian mirror to see into the future We may look down our noses at his ideas but one may be sure that in outlook he was far closer to a Maya priest astronomer than is an astronomer of our century The Maya made meticulous observations of celestial bodies This information was used for divination so Maya astronomy was essentially for astrological purposes Although Maya astronomy was mainly used by the priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time and project them into the future to produce prophecy it also had some practical applications such as providing aid in crop planting and harvesting The priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon and movements of Venus and the stars these were measured against dated events in the past on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device Analysis of the few remaining Postclassic codices has revealed that at the time of European contact the Maya had recorded eclipse tables calendars and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in Europe The Maya measured the 584day Venus cycle with an error of just two hours Five cycles of Venus equated to eight 365day haab calendrical cycles and this period was recorded in the codices The Maya also followed the movements of Jupiter Mars and Mercury When Venus rose as the Morning Star this was associated with the rebirth of the Maya Hero Twins For the Maya the heliacal rising of Venus was associated with destruction and upheaval Venus was closely associated with warfare and the hieroglyph meaning war incorporated the glyphelement symbolizing the planet Sightlines through the windows of the Caracol building at Chichen Itza align with the northernmost and southernmost extremes of Venus path Maya rulers launched military campaigns to coincide with the heliacal or cosmical rising of Venus and would also sacrifice important captives to coincide with such conjunctions Solar and lunar eclipses were considered to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world In the Dresden Codex a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the kin day hieroglyph Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster Religion and mythology In common with the rest of Mesoamerica the Maya believed in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities who needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors who would intercede for their living descendants in dealings with the supernatural realm The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural were shamans Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan oracular priests Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies which are hallucinogenic in high doses As the Maya civilization developed the ruling elite codified the Maya world view into religious cults that justified their right to rule In the Late Preclassic this process culminated in the institution of the divine king the kuhul ajaw endowed with ultimate political and religious power The Maya viewed the cosmos as highly structured There were thirteen levels in the heavens and nine in the underworld with the mortal world in between Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour north was white east was red south was yellow and west was black Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours Maya households interred their dead underneath the floors with offerings appropriate to the social status of the family There the dead could act as protective ancestors Maya lineages were patrilineal so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasised often with a household shrine As Maya society developed and the elite became more powerful Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors Belief in supernatural forces pervaded Maya life from the simplest daytoday activities such as cooking to trade politics and elite activities Maya deities governed all aspects of the world both visible and invisible The Maya priesthood was a closed group drawing its members from the established elite by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books including astronomical observations calendrical cycles history and mythology The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting bloodletting incense burning music ritual dance and on certain occasions human sacrifice During the Classic period the Maya ruler was the high priest and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods It is highly likely that among commoners shamanism continued in parallel to state religion By the Postclassic religious emphasis had changed there was an increase in worship of the images of deities and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice Archaeologists painstakingly reconstruct these ritual practices and beliefs using several techniques One important though incomplete resource is physical evidence such as dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits shrines and burials with their associated funerary offerings Maya art architecture and writing are another resource and these can be combined with ethnographic sources including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest Human sacrifice Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering By extension the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed with lower status captives being used for labour Important rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler perhaps in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the death gods In AD 738 the vassal king Kak Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quirigu captured his overlord Uaxaclajuun Ubaah Kawiil of Copn and a few days later ritually decapitated him Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured being variously beaten scalped burnt or disembowelled Another myth associated with decapitation was that of the Hero Twins recounted in the Popol Vuh playing a ballgame against the gods of the underworld the heroes achieved victory but one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their opponents During the Postclassic period the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction influenced by the rites of the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple or upon the summit of the pyramid In one ritual the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests except for the hands and feet and the officiating priest would then dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim and perform a ritual dance symbolizing the rebirth of life Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period Deities The Maya world was populated by a great variety of deities supernatural entities and sacred forces The Maya had such a broad interpretation of the sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate The Maya interpretation of deities was closely tied to the calendar astronomy and their cosmology The importance of a deity its characteristics and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation when the correct ceremonies should be performed and what would be an appropriate offering Each deity had four manifestations associated with the cardinal directions each identified with a different colour They also had a dual daynightlifedeath aspect Itzamna was the creator god but he also embodied the cosmos and was simultaneously a sun god Kinich Ahau the day sun was one of his aspects Maya kings frequently identified themselves with Kinich Ahau Itzamna also had a night sun aspect the Night Jaguar representing the sun in its journey through the underworld The four Pawatuns supported the corners of the mortal realm in the heavens the Bacabs performed the same function As well as their four main aspects the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood The four Chaacs were storm gods controlling thunder lightning and the rains The nine lords of the night each governed one of the underworld realms Other important deities included the moon goddess the maize god and the Hero Twins The Popol Vuh was written in the Latin script in early colonial times and was probably transcribed from a hieroglyphic book by an unknown Kiche Maya nobleman It is one of the most outstanding works of indigenous literature in the Americas The Popul Vuh recounts the mythical creation of the world the legend of the Hero Twins and the history of the Postclassic Kiche kingdom Deities recorded in the Popul Vuh include Hun Hunahpu believed by some to be the Kiche maize god and a triad of deities led by the Kiche patron Tohil and also including the moon goddess Awilix and the mountain god Jacawitz In common with other Mesoamerican cultures the Maya worshipped feathered serpent deities Such worship was rare during the Classic period but by the Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatn Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands In Yucatn the feathered serpent deity was Kukulkan among the Kiche it was Ququmatz Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period War Serpent Waxaklahun Ubah Kan and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico Likewise Ququmatz had a composite origin combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna Agriculture The ancient Maya had diverse and sophisticated methods of food production It was believed that shifting cultivation swidden agriculture provided most of their food but it is now thought that permanent raised fields terracing intensive gardening forest gardens and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas Indeed evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today raised fields connected by canals can be seen on aerial photographs Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in preColumbian times and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize manioc sunflower seeds cotton and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC The basic staples of the Maya diet were maize beans and squashes These were supplemented with a wide variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest At Joya de Cern a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes among them were chilies and tomatoes Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground perhaps to produce cooking oil In addition to basic foodstuffs the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton cacao and vanilla Cacao was especially prized by the elite who consumed chocolate beverages Cotton was spun dyed and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded The Maya had few domestic animals dogs were domesticated by 3000 BC and the Muscovy duck by the Late Postclassic Ocellated turkeys were unsuitable for domestication but were rounded up in the wild and penned for fattening All of these were used as food animals dogs were additionally used for hunting It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened Maya sites There are hundreds of Maya sites spread across five countries Belize El Salvador Guatemala Honduras and Mexico The six sites with particularly outstanding architecture or sculpture are Chichen Itza Palenque Uxmal and Yaxchilan in Mexico Tikal in Guatemala and Copn in Honduras Other important but difficult to reach sites include Calakmul and El Mirador The principal sites in the Puuc region after Uxmal are Kabah Labna and Sayil In the east of the Yucatn Peninsula are Coba and the small site of Tulum The Ro Bec sites of the base of the peninsula include Becan Chicann Kohunlich and Xpuhil The most noteworthy sites in Chiapas other than Palenque and Yaxchilan are Bonampak and Tonin In the Guatemalan Highlands are Iximche Kaminaljuyu Mixco Viejo and Qumarkaj also known as Utatln In the northern Petn lowlands of Guatemala there are many sites though apart from Tikal access is generally difficult Some of the Petn sites are Dos Pilas Seibal and Uaxactn Important sites in Belize include Altun Ha Caracol and Xunantunich Genetics Researchers in 2024 analyzed the genomes of ancient individuals from the Mayan city at Chichn Itz Results revealed they grouped together with modern Amerindian populations especially the present day Maya based on PCA and Admixture analysis The 53 remains were on average modelled as 92 Indigenous American component with 7 of European genetic contribution and 003 African ancestry Museum collections There are many museums across the world with Maya artefacts in their collections

    title: "Chinese mythology",
    originalContent:
      "Chinese mythology traditional Chinese simplified Chinese pinyin Zhnggu shnhu is mythology that has been passed down in oral form or recorded in literature throughout the area now known as Greater China Chinese mythology encompasses a diverse array of myths derived from regional and cultural traditions Populated with engaging narratives featuring extraordinary individuals and beings endowed with magical powers these stories often unfold in fantastical mythological realms or historical epochs Similar to numerous other mythologies Chinese mythology has historically been regarded at least partially as a factual record of the past Along with Chinese folklore Chinese mythology forms an important part of Chinese folk religion and Taoism especially older popular forms of it Many narratives recounting characters and events from ancient times exhibit a dual tradition one that presents a more historicized or euhemerized interpretation and another that offers a more mythological perspective Numerous myths delve into the creation and cosmology of the universe exploring the origins of deities and heavenly inhabitants Some narratives specifically address the topic of creation unraveling the beginnings of things people and culture Additionally certain myths are dedicated to the genesis of the Chinese state A subset myths provides a chronology of prehistoric times often featuring a culture hero who taught people essential skills ranging from building houses and cooking to the basics of writing In some cases they were revered as the ancestor of an ethnic group or dynastic families Chinese mythology is intimately connected to the traditional Chinese concepts of li and qi These two foundational concepts are deeply entwined with socially oriented ritual acts including communication greetings dances ceremonies and sacrifices Classification Ancient myths Pangu creating the world Nuwa mending the sky and creating human beings Jingwei filling the sea Kuafu chasing the sun Dayu controlling the flood Gonggong hitting Mount Buzhou in anger the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs Cangjie creating characters Xingtian dancing with Ganqi and many other famous myths Folk myths and legends The Legend of the White Snake The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl Change Flying to the Moon Houyi Shooting the Sun Wu Gang Cutting the Cassia Tree Meng Jiangnu Weeping Down the Great Wall Drilling Two Woods to Make Fire Black Dog Eating the Moon The Butterfly Lovers Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains Goddess of Luo River and Mi Fei King Mus Journey to the West Magu Offering Longevity Danzhu Turning into a Bird The Slaying of the Unicorn Lark Exterminating the Dragon King Wangs Crying Cuckoo The Acacia Tree Jigong The Legend of New Years Eve The Twelve Chinese Zodiac Signs The Carp Leaping over the Dragon Gate The Money Tree and the Treasure Bowl The Seven Brothers of the Yang Family The Five Brothers The Book from Heaven The Legend of the Dragon Boat Festival The Legend of Sun Moon Lake and other famous myths and legends Literary myths and legends Nezha Conquers the Dragon King Havoc in Heaven Journey to the West Investiture of the Gods Splitting the Mountain to Save the Mother The Precious Lotus Lantern and other famous myths and legends Mythology and religion Significant interplay exists between Chinese mythology and the philosophical traditions of Confucianism Taoism and Buddhism Elements of preHan dynasty mythology such as those in Classic of Mountains and Seas were adapted into these belief systems as they developed in the case of Taoism or were assimilated into Chinese culture in the case of Buddhism Conversely teachings and beliefs from Confucianism Taoism and Buddhism have in turn become integral components of Chinese mythology For example the Taoist belief of a spiritual paradise became incorporated into mythology as the place where immortals and deities dwell Sometimes mythological and religious ideas have become widespread across Chinas many regions and diverse ethnic societies In other cases beliefs are more limited to certain social groups for example the veneration of white stones by the Qiang One mythological theme that has a long history and many variations involves a shamanic world view for example in the cases of Mongolian shamanism among the Mongols Hmong shamanism among the Miao people and the shamanic beliefs of the Qing dynasty from 1643 to 1912 derived from the Manchus Politically mythology was often used to legitimize the dynasties of China with the founding house of a dynasty claiming a divine descent Mythology and philosophy Elaborations on the wuxing are not really part of mythology although belief in five elements could appear The Hundred Schools of Thought is a phrase suggesting the diversity of philosophical thought that developed during the Warring States of China Then and subsequently philosophical movements had a complicated relationship with mythology However as far as they influence or are influenced by mythology divides the philosophical camps into two rough halves a Liberal group and a Conservative group The liberal group being associated with the idea of individuality and change for example as seen in the mythology of divination in China such as the mythology of the dragon horse that delivered the eight bagua diagrams to Fu Xi and methods of individual empowerment as seen in the Yi Jing Book of Changes The Liberal tendency is towards individual freedom Daoism and Nature The relationship of the Conservative philosophies to mythology is seen in the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons mythology about the emperors and central bureaucratic governance Confucianism written histories ceremonial observances subordination of the individual to the social groups of family and state and a fixation on stability and enduring institutions The distinction between the Liberal and Conservative is very general but important in Chinese thought Contradictions can be found in the details however these are often traditional such as the embrace by Confucius of the philosophical aspects of the Yi Jing and the backandforth about the Mandate of Heaven wherein one dynasty ends and another begins based according to accounts some of heavily mythological where the Way of Heaven results in change but then a new ethical stable dynasty becomes established Examples of this include the stories of Yi Yin Tang of Shang and Jie of Xia or the similar fantastic stories around Duke of Zhou and King Zhou of Shang Mythology and ritual Mythology exists in relationship with other aspects of society and culture such as ritual Various rituals are explained by mythology For example the ritual burning of mortuary banknotes Hell Money lighting fireworks and so on Yubu A good example of the relationship between Chinese mythology and ritual is the Yubu also known as the Steps or Paces of Yu During the course of his activities in controlling the Great Flood Yu was supposed to have so fatigued himself that he lost all the hair from his legs and developed a serious limp Daoist practitioners sometimes incorporate a curiously choreographed pedal locomotion into various rituals Mythology and practice one explains the other in these rituals the sacred time of Yu merges with the sacral practice of the present Cosmology Various ideas about the nature of the earth the universe and their relationship to each other have historically existed as either a background or a focus of mythologies One typical view is of a square earth separated from a round sky by sky pillars mountains trees or undefined Above the sky is the realm of Heaven often viewed of as a vast area with many inhabitants Often the heavenly inhabitants are thought to be of an as above so below nature their lives and social arrangements being parallel to those on earth with a hierarchical government run by a supreme emperor many palaces and lesser dwellings a vast bureaucracy of many functions clerks guards and servants Below was a vast under ground land also known as Diyu Yellow Springs Hell and other terms As time progressed the idea of an underground land in which the souls of the departed were punished for their misdeeds during life became explicit related to developments in Daoism and Buddhism The underground world also came to be conceived of as inhabited by a vast bureaucracy with kings judges torturers conductors of souls minor bureaucrats recording secretaries similar to the structure of society in the Middle Kingdom earthly China Mythological places and concepts The mythology of China includes a mythological geography describing individual mythological descriptions of places and the features sometimes this reaches to the level of a cosmological conception Various features of mythological terrain are described in myth including a Heavenly world above the earth a land of the dead beneath the earth palaces beneath the sea and various fantastic areas or features of the earth located beyond the limits of the known earth Such mythological features include mountains rivers forests or fantastic trees and caves or grottoes These then serve as the location for the actions of various beings and creatures One concept encountered in some myths is the idea of travel between Earth and Heaven by means of climbing up or down the pillars separating the two there usually being four or Eight Pillars or an unspecified number of these Sky Ladders Directional The Four Symbols of Chinese cosmology were the Azure Dragon of the East the Black Tortoise of the North the White Tiger of the West and the Vermillion Bird of the South These totem animals represented the four cardinal directions with a lot of associated symbolism and beliefs A fifth cardinal direction was also postulated the center represented by the emperor of China located in the middle of his Middle Kingdom Zhong Guo or China The real or mythological inhabitants making their dwellings at these cardinal points were numerous as is associated mythology Heavenly realm The Heavenly realm is described by the Chinese word Tian which can be translated into English as both Heaven and sky Sometimes this was personified into a deity sky god In some descriptions this was an elaborate place ruled over by a supreme deity or a group of supreme deities Jade Emperor being associated with Daoism and Buddhas with Buddhism Many astronomically observable features were subjects of mythology or the mythological locations and settings for mythic scenes These include the sun stars moon planets Milky Way sometimes referred to as the River of Heaven clouds and other features These were often the home or destination of various deities divinities shamans and many more Another concept of the Heavenly realm is that of the Cords of the Sky Travel between Heaven and Earth was usually described as achieved by flying or climbing The Queqiao Quqio was a bridge formed by birds flying across the Milky Way as seen in The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl mythology surrounding the Qixi Festival The hazy band of stars of the Milky Way was referred to as the Silvery River or the River of Heaven Subterranean realm According to mythology beneath the Earth is another realman underground world generally said to be inhabited by the souls of dead humans and various supernatural beings see hun and po This hell is known by various names including Diyu or the Yellow Springs In more recent mythology the underground inhabitation of the dead is generally described as somewhat similar to the land above it possesses a hierarchical government bureaucracy centered in the capital city of Youdu The rulers of the underground realm are various kings whose duties include parsing the souls of the dead according to the merits of their life on earth and maintaining adequate records regarding that process An example of one such ruler is Ynlu wng King Yanluo Souls are parsed and adjudicated for torturous punishment by balancing ones crimes in life against any merits earned through good deeds Various other functions within Diyu are performed by minor officials and minions examples of whom are OxHead and HorseFace humanoid devils with animal features In some versions of mythology or Chinese folk religion souls are returned from Diyu and reincarnated after being given the Drink of Forgetfulness by Meng Po Earthly realm Much mythology involves remote exotic or hardtogetto places All sorts of mythological geography is said to exist at the extremes of the cardinal directions of earth Much of the earthly terrain has been said to be inhabited by local spirits sometimes called fairies or genii loci especially mountains and bodies of water There are Grotto Heavens and also earthly paradises Seas rivers and islands Various bodies of water appear in Chinese mythology This includes oceans rivers streams ponds Often they are part of a mythological geography and may have notable features such as mythological islands or other mythological features There are mythological versions of all the major rivers that have existed in China in between ancient and modern China most of these rivers are the same but not all Sometimes these rivers are said to originate from the Milky Way or Kunlun Anyway they are said to flow west to east because Gonggong wrecked the world pillar at Buzhou tilting Earth and Heaven away from each other at that sector Examples of these mythologized rivers include the Yangzi including various stretches under different names the Yellow River the mythological Red River in the west near Kunlun and the Weak River a mythological river in the west near Kunlun which flowed with a liquid too light in specific gravity for floating or swimming but unbreathable Examples of features along mythological rivers include the Dragon Gates Longmen which were rapid waterfalls where select carp can transform into dragons by swimming upstream and leaping up over the falls Examples of islands include Mount Penglai a paradisaical isle in the sea vaguely east of China but sometimes conflated with Japan Mountains and inbetween places Various other mythological locales include what are known as fairylands or paradises pillars separating Earth and Sky ruined or otherwise The Earth has many extreme and exotic locales they are separated by pillars between Earth and Heaven supporting the sky usually four or eight Generally Chinese mythology regarded people as living in the middle regions of the world and conceived the exotic earthly places to exist in the directional extremes to the north east south or west Eventually the idea of an eastern and western paradise seems to have arisen In the west according to certain myths there was Kunlun On the eastern seacoast was Feather Mountain the place of exile of Gun and other events during or just after the world flood Further east was Fusang a mythical tree or else an island sometimes interpreted as Japan The geography of China in which the land seems to be higher in the west and tilt down toward the east and with the rivers tending to flow westtoeast was explained by the damage Gonggong did to the world pillar Mount Buzhou mountain pillars separating the sky from the world China which also displaced the Celestial Pole so that the sky rotates offcenter Kunlun In the west was Kunlun although it is also sometimes said to be towards the south seas Kunlun was pictured as having a mountain or mountain range Kunlun Mountain where dwelt various divinities grew fabulous plants home to exotic animals and various deities and immortals today there is a real mountain or range named Kunlun as there has in the past however the identity has shifted further west over time The Qing Niao bird was a mythical bird and messenger of Xi Wangmu to the rest of the world Nearby to Kunlun it was sometimes said or written and forming a sort of protective barrier to the western paradise or fairyland named Xunp where also was to be found the jade pool Yoch eventually thought to exist on mount Kunlun which itself was thought to possess cliffs insurmountable to normal mortals was the Moving Sands a semimythological place also to the west of China the real Taklamakan Desert to the west of or in China is known for its shifting sands There were other locations of mythological geography around the area of Kunlun such as Jade Mountain and the various colored rivers which flew out of Kunlun For example the Red or Scarlet River was supposed to flow to the south of Kunlun Mythological and semimythological chronology Mythological and semimythological chronology includes mythic representations of the creation of the world population and sometimes repopulations by humans sometimes floods and various cultural developments such as the development of ruling dynasties Many myths and stories have been recounted about the early dynasties however more purely historical literature tends to begin with the Qin dynasty for example see Paladin 1998 On the other hand accounts of the Shang Xia and early Zhou dynasties tend to mythologize By a historical process of euhemerism many of these myths evolved over time into variant versions with an emphasis on moral parables and rationalization of some of the more fantastic ideas Mythology of time and calendar Mythology of time and the calendar includes the twelve zodiacal animals and various divine or spiritual genii regulating or appointed as guardians for years days or hours Twelve zodiacal animals In China and surrounding areas a calendrical system consisting of measuring time in cycles of twelve represented by twelve has an ancient historical past The exact lineup of animals is sometimes slightly different but the basic principle is that each animal takes a turn as the emblematic or totem animal for a year or other unit of time in a cycle of one dozen This is explained by various myths The zodiacs in order are Rat Ox Tiger Rabbit Dragon Snake Horse Goat Monkey Rooster Dog and Pig Correlation of mythological and real time Some Chinese mythology becomes specific about chronological time based on the ganzhi system numbers of human generations or other details suggesting synchronization between the mythological chronology and the ideas of modern historians However real correlation begins in the Year of the Metal Monkey Zhou dynasty 841 BCE a since validated claim by Sima Qian However although historians take note of this subsequent mythology has not tended to reflect this quest for rational historical timelining Creation myths Various ideas about the creation of the universe the earth the sky various deities and creatures and the origin of various clans or ethnic groups of humans have circulated in the area of China for millennia These creation myths may include the origins of the universe and everything the origins of humans or the origins of specific groups such as a Han Chinese in descent from Yandi and Huangdi as Descendants of the Flame and Yellow Emperors Various myths contain explanations of various origins and the progress of cultural development Pangu One common story involves Pangu Among other sources he was written about by Taoist author Xu Zheng c 200 CE as claimed to be the first sentient being and creator making the heavens and the earth Age of heroes Various culture heroes have been said to have helped or saved humanity in many ways such as stopping floods teaching the use of fire and so on As mythic chronology is inherently nonlinear with time being telescopically expanded or contracted there are various contradictions The earliest culture heroes were sometimes considered deities and other times heroic humans but often little distinction was made Examples of early culture heroes include Youchao Have Nest who taught people how to make wooden shelters and Suiren Fire Maker who taught people the use of fire and cooking thus saving them from much foodpoisoning in addition to developing cuisine Another example of a mythological hero who provided beneficial knowledge to humanity involves sericulture the production of silk an invention credited to Leizu for one An example of a nonHan ethnicity culture hero is Panhu Because of their selfidentification as descendants from these original ancestors Panhu has been worshiped by the Yao people and the She people often as King Pan and the eating of dog meat was tabooed This ancestral myth has also been found among the Miao people and Li people Some of the first culture heroes are the legendary emperors who succeeded the times of the parthuman partserpent deities Nuwa and Fuxi these emperors tend to be portrayed as more explicitly human although Huangdi the Yellow Emperor is often portrayed as partdragon during life Mythological emperors Historicity Some historicized versions of semihistorical and undeniably mythologized accounts of ancient times were used by those who have attempted to apply actual BCE dates to the mythological chronology Traditional Chinese accounts of the early emperors chronologically locate the Yellow Emperor as having lived in the Northern Chinese plain around 2698 to 2599 BCE about seventeen generations after the time of Shennong A major difference between the possible historicity of material embedded in mythological accounts is that through the time of the last Flame Emperor Yandi information was recorded using knotted ropes whereas the introduction of writing is associated with the reign of Huang Di although the historical continuity of written tradition beginning at that time is a matter of discussion by experts The most prominent of the first emperors include in chronological order Huangdi Gaoyang Zhuanxu Gaoxin Di Ku Yao and Shun These emperors were said to be morally upright and benevolent and examples to be emulated by latterday kings and emperors Sometimes approximate calculations of times have been made based on the claimed number of generations from one significant mythological figure to the next as in the case of the legendary founder of the Ji family Hou Ji whose descendants would rule generations after his mythological appearance as the historical Zhou dynasty beginning around 1046 BCE Despite various assignments of dates to the accounts of these Emperors fantastic claims about the length of their reigns are common The average reignlengths that these numbers imply are improbable and there is a lack of consensus regarding these dates by modern historians Their historical use may be limited to establishing a relative chronology Houji Houji was a cultural hero of the agricultural type Chiyou Chiyou also known as Chih Yu was a metallurgical engineer specializing in weaponry Three Primeval Emperors Five Premier Emperors and Three Dynasties The mythological history of people or at least the Han Chinese people begins with two groups one of three and one of five The numbers are symbolically significant however the actual membership of the two groups is not explicated There are different lists The older group is the Three Primeval Emperors who were followed by the Five Premier Emperors After that came the Three Dynasties these were the Xia dynasty Shang dynasty and the Zhou dynasty These three are all historically attested to but separating the myth from the history is not always clear nevertheless there is a lot of mythology around the Three Primeval Emperors Five Premier Emperors and Three Dynasties An age of Three Primeval Emperors followed by the age of the Five Premier Emperors SnhungWd contrasts with the subsequent treatment of chronology by dynasties up to recent times Since the time the Qin emperor titled himself huangdi by combining two previous titles into one huangdi was the title for Chinese emperors for ages Three Primeval Emperors Title The title of the Three Primeval Emperors is huang in Chinese The original connotation of this title is unknown and it is variously translated into English Translations include Sovereign Emperor and August Names The names of the Three Primeval Emperors include Youchao Have Nest Suiren Fire Maker PaoxiFuxi Animal Domesticator and Shennong Divine Husbandman Sometimes Huangdi is included Five Premier Emperors Title The title of the Five Premier Emperors is di in Chinese The original connotation of this title is unknown or how it compares or contrasts with the term huang and it is variously translated into English Translations include Sovereign Emperor and Lord Names Names of the Five Premier Emperors include Huangdi Shaohao Zhuanxu Di Ku Yao and Shun Nuwa and Fuxi Nuwa and Fuxi also known as Paoxi are sometimes worshiped as the ultimate ancestor of all humankind and are often represented as halfsnake halfhumans Nuwas companion Fuxi was her brother and husband Nuwa saves the world After GongGong was said to have damaged the world pillar holding the earth and sky apart the sky was rent causing fires floods the Flood of Nuwa and other devastating events which were only remedied when Nwa repaired the sky with five colored stones The figure of Nwa also referred to as N Kwa appeared in literature no earlier than c 350 BCE It is sometimes believed that Nwa molded humans from clay to populate or repopulate the world thus creating modern humans Fuxi and the Yellow River map The production of the Yellow River Map is associated mythologically with Fuxi but is also sometimes placed in subsequent eras Shennong and Yan Emperors Shennong is variously translated as Divine Farmer or Divine Peasant or Agriculture God and also known as the Wugushen Spirit of the Five Grains and Wuguxiandi First Deity of the Five Grains Shennong is a mythological Chinese deity in Chinese folk religion and venerated as a mythical sage ruler of prehistoric China Shennongs descendants began to style themselves as Yan Emperor Yandi or Flame Emperor Yandi is often considered an important mythological emperor although Yandi is sometimes considered as series of emperors bearing the same title the Yan Emperors or Flame Emperors Yan literally means flame implying that Yan Emperors people possibly uphold a symbol of fire as their tribal totems K C Wu speculates that this appellation may be connected with the use of fire to clear the fields in slash and burn agriculture And Yandi is also a Red Emperor Yellow Emperor and Leizu One of the more important figures in Chinese mythology is the Yellow Emperor or Huang Di His original name was Yellow Soil or Huangdi where di was the Chinese word for soil or ground He was named after the Yellow Soil in the Yellow River Basin area where Chinese civilization was thought to have originated Future generations later changed it to di or emperor in order to give Huangdi a more sovereignsounding name He also appears as Xuanyuan Huang Di is also referred to as one of the Five August ones and one of the few consistent members of the list There were also other colored emperors such as Black Green Red and White According to some mythology Huang Di was the son of Shaodian who was the halfbrother of Yan Di Huang Dis mother was said to be Fubao Huang Dis wife Leizu is supposed to have invented sericulture In some versions Cangjie invented writing during the reign of Huang Di The Yellow Emperor is said to have fought a great battle against Chiyou Huangdi had various wives and many descendants including Shaohao leader of the Dongyi Di Ku Ku Di Ku Ti Ku or Diku is also known as Kao Hsin or Goxn Diku is an important mythological figure as signified by his title Di basically signifying possession of some sort of imperial divinity as in the sense of the Roman title wiktdivus something sometimes translated as emperor Diku is sometimes considered to descend from Huangdi and to be ancestral to the ruling family of the Shang dynasty of the second millennium BCE Diku is credited with the invention of various musical instruments along with musical pieces for them to accompany Diku is said to have consorted with the semidivine females Jiang Yuan and Jiandi Yao and Shun Yao and Shun were important mythological rulers exemplars of propriety in rulership The Great Flood began during the reign of Yao and continued through the time of Shun the successor of Yao who had passed over his own son and made Shun his successor because of Shuns ability and morality Historically when Qin Shi Huang united China in 221 BCE he used propaganda to acclaim his achievements as surpassing those of mythological rulers who had gone before him He combined the ancient titles of Hung and D to create a new title Hungd thus the Qin emperor used mythology to bolster his claims to be the legitimate and absolute ruler of the whole earth This reflected what was to become a longstanding belief that all civilized people should have one government and that it should be Chinese Gun Yu and the Great Flood Shun passed on his place as emperor to Yu the Great The Yellow River prone to flooding erupted in a huge flood in the time of Yao The flood disrupted society and endangered human existence as agricultural fields drowned hunting game disappeared and the people were dislocated to hills and mountains Yus father Gun was put in charge of flood control by Yao but failed to alleviate the problem after nine years In some versions Gun was executed by Shuns minister Zhurong for this failure but according to others Gun was merely exiled for opposing the elevation of Shun as coemperor In more purely mythological versions the story is more along the lines that Gun transformed into an animal shape to escape the wrath of Heaven for having dared to go to Heaven and steal the floodfighting expanding earth xirang He fled to Feather Mountain and was struck dead by the fire god Zhurong on behalf of Heaven After three years his son Yu appeared out of his belly usually said to be in the form of some fantastic animal Yu took his fathers place fighting the flood leading the people to build canals and levees often said to be with the help of Xirang After thirteen years of toil Yu abated the flood Why the Xirang failed to work when Gun used it and he was punished by Heaven but when Yu used it he was able to stop the flood and was rewarded by Heaven is a question frequently made in the myths The mythology of Yu and his associates during their work in controlling the flood and simultaneously saving the people can be seen in various ways to symbolize different societal and cultural developments such as innovations in hunting agriculture welldigging astronomy social and political organizing and other cultural innovations that occur during the course of the mythology around the flood stories For example a historicized version of xirang explains this soil may represent an innovative type of raised garden made up of soil brushwood and similar materials Thus Yu and his work in controlling the flood with xirang would symbolize a societal development allowing a large scale approach to transforming wetlands into arable fields Yu was said to be the founder of the Xia dynasty First dynasties The first three dynasties have especial significance in mythology Xia dynasty The Xia dynasty is the first dynasty in traditional Chinese historiography as known through literary accounts However many of these accounts contain elements of a clearly semimythological and in some versions completely mythological or fanciful The founding mythology of the early dynasties tends to have certain common general features including the divine assistance obtained in the founding and the reasons for it The fighter of the Great Flood Yu the Great had served Yao and Shun and they enfeoffed him as the Prince of Xia an area of land Upon Yus death questions arose regarding the method of imperial succession which would be a key factor as an example for Chinese culture for millennia The question was who would succeed Yu upon his death It could be his son Qi of Xia also known as Kai or the deputy that competently and diligently helped in the work against the great flood a mighty hunter who helped feed the people during a time when agriculture had been rendered impossible Bo Yi The mythological variants are much concerned with the relative merits between the two Qis succession broke the previous convention of meritorious succession in favor of hereditary succession thus initiating a dynastic tradition The new dynasty was called Xia after Yus centre of power Shang dynasty The Shang dynasty is the earliest dynasty of traditional Chinese history firmly supported by archaeological evidence Yet as in common with the founding of Xia there is mythological material regarding how the previous dynasty turned to evil and unworthy ways and the founder of miraculous birth or ancestry overthrew it The mythology of the Shang dynasty is distinct from philosophical and historical accounts Significant mythology includes the origin of its founders the miraculous birth by Jiandi of Shang founder Qi also known as Xie of Shang after she became pregnant upon swallowing or holding in her bosom a birds egg After several generations Xie or Qis descendant Tang became king of Shang by overthrowing Jie the last king of the Xia dynasty said to be a very drunken and bloodthirsty tyrant The fifth book of the philosopher Mozi describes the end of the Xia dynasty and the beginning of the Shang During the reign of King Jie of Xia there was a great climatic change Legends hold that the paths of the sun and moon changed the seasons became confused and the five grains dried up Ghouls cried in the country and cranes shrieked for ten nights Heaven ordered Shang Tang to receive the heavenly commission from the Xia dynasty which had failed morally and which Heaven was determined to end Shang Tang was commanded to destroy Xia with the promise of Heavens help In the dark Heaven destroyed the fortress pool and Shang Tang then gained victory easily Condemnation of Offensive War III by Mozi After discussing the end of Xia and the beginning of Shang Mozi describes the end of Shang and the beginning of the succeeding Zhou dynasty During the reign of Shang Zhu Heaven could not endure Zhus morality and neglect of timely sacrifices It rained mud for ten days and nights the nine cauldrons shifted positions supernatural prodigies appeared and ghosts cried at night There were women who became men while it rained flesh and thorny brambles covering the national highways A red bird brought a message Heaven decrees King Wen of Zhou to punish Yin and possess its empire The Yellow River formed charts and the earth brought forth mythical horses When King Wu became king three gods appeared to him in a dream telling him that they had drowned Shang Zhu in wine and that King Wu was to attack him On the way back from victory the heavens gave him the emblem of a yellow bird The mythological events surrounding the end of the Shang dynasty and the establishment of the Zhou greatly influenced the subject and story told in the popular novel Investiture of the Gods Founding of the Zhu dynasty The origins of the Ji dynastic founding family of the Zhu dynasty is replete with mythological material going back to its legendary founder Houji who was originally named Qi but a different Qi than the Shang founder known as Xie or Qi Myths about Houji include those of his mythical origins of which there are two main myths The end of the Shang overlaps the rise of the Zhu so there is shared material Once established the Zhu were characterized by their volume of literature in the beginning much of it justifying their overthrow of the Shang However it was not long before much historical material appeared of a rational rationalized philosophical or otherwise nonmythological nature Bagua One of the main legacies of the rise of Zhou was the dissemination of the classic book I Ching however the eight trigrams must be from a far earlier period than Wengong and even more than the editing and commentary by Confucius mythology references the culture hero sometimes named Fuxi Subsequent dynasties Dynasties succeeding Zhou had notable mythological material such as the accumulation of legend around the Jianan transition between Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms contention reflected in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms From the Tang dynasty on legends occur around the monk Xuanzangs quest for Buddhist scriptures sutras from the area moreorless corresponding to modern India which influenced the Ming dynasty novel Journey to the West Important deities spirits and mythological people There are various important deities spirits and mythological people in Chinese mythology and folk religion Some are clearly divine such as the Jade Emperor and even he is sometimes said to have begun life as a mortal However in Chinese language many beings are referred to as shen Sometimes Chinese mythology is called Mandarin Chinese Zhnggu Shnhu Due to the ambiguity of this word when translated into English it is not always clear how to classify in English the entities described as shen The category shen is rather comprehensive and generic in Chinese myth and religion shen may be spirits goddesses or gods ghosts or other Another important concept is the classification of immortals xian Immortals are more a category of quality than a description of an actual type Immortals are defined by living for a long time maybe forever However this is not a static quality since Daoist adepts shamans or others are said to become immortals through right effort and various practices Another example is the immortality sometimes obtained by the lohans Bodhisattvas and Buddhas of Buddhist religion and mythology this contrasts with indefinitely prolonged series of unenlightened rebirths Chinese mythology often tends to not make a clear differentiation between Buddhist and Daoist types Various deities spirits and immortals xian are encountered in various myths Some of these are particularly associated with Daoism Some immortals or others became incorporated into Daoism as it developed as a phenomenon deriving from ancient shamanic cults or other sources The line between Daoism and folk religion is not clear Other mythological beings are clearly derived through the process of the introduction of Buddhism into China Major deities The concept of a principal or presiding deity has fluctuated over time in Chinese mythology Shangdi Shangdi also sometimes Hungtin Dd appeared as early as the Shang dynasty In later eras he was more commonly referred to as Hungtin Shngd The use of Hungtin Dd refers to the Jade Emperor and Tian Jade Emperor Chinese mythology holds that the Jade Emperor was charged with running of the three realms heaven hell and the realm of the living The Jade Emperor adjudicated and meted out rewards and remedies to saints the living and the deceased according to a merit system loosely called the Jade Principles Golden Script Y l jn pin When proposed judgments were objected to usually by other saints the administration would occasionally resort to the counsels of advisory elders The Jade Emperor appeared in literature after the establishment of Taoism in China his appearance as Yu Huang dates back to beyond the times of Yellow Emperor Nwa or Fuxi Tian Tian can be either a sky deity by that name or Heaven the Sky itself Tian appeared in literature c 700 BCE possibly earlier as dating depends on the date of the Shujing Book of Documents There are no creationoriented narratives for Tian The qualities of Tian and Shangdi appear to have merged in later literature and are now worshiped as one entity Hungtin Shngd in for example the Beijings Temple of Heaven The extent of the distinction between Tian and Shangdi is debated The sinologist Herrlee Creel claims that an analysis of the Shang oracle bones reveals Shangdi to have preceded Tian as a deity and that Zhou dynasty authors replaced the term Shangdi with Tian to cement the claims of their influence Nwa Nwa or Ngua is considered a mother goddess of Chinese mythology She was involved in the creation of humanity and repairing the Pillars of Heaven Nwa is often depicted as half snake half human and is sometimes considered one of the Three Sovereigns along with her brother and husband Fuxi Fuxi Fuxi is the first of the Three Sovereigns He created humanity alongside his sister and wife Nwa and like her is depicted as half snake half human Fuxi is closely associated with the I Ching Daoism and Chinese mythology Over time certain aspects of folk religion and belief coalesced and were refined into a group of formal religious beliefs practices and philosophy known as Daoism One of the founders of Daoism was Old Man Laozi who himself entered into legend or mythology There is much overlap between religion and mythology and between Chinese folk religion and Daoism However certain beings or concepts of Chinese mythology have a particularly strong association with religious or philosophical Daoism For example the Jade Emperor Yhung is a major actor in many myths In Daoistrelated mythology there is often a strong presence of sorcery and magic such as spells charms magical abilities and elixirs The development of Daoism as it came to be called was a lengthy one with various strands including both rationalist ethical philosophy and a magicoreligious stand informed by mythology As Daoism developed as a concept from its traditional roots in Chinese folk religion and mythology its legitimacy was bolstered by claims of originating with Huangdi the Yellow Emperor For example some of the Huangdi Sijing material the Huangdi Yinfujing and the Huangdi Neijing are Daoist classics with claims to a scriptural legacy going back to Huangdi Buddhist influences Buddhism was historically introduced to China probably in the first century CE accompanied by the import of various ideas about deities and supernatural beings including Kitigarbha who was renamed Dizang the Four Heavenly Kings the main Buddha himself Shakyamuni Buddha Shjimunf Avalokitevara who after a few centuries metamorphosized into Guanyin also Kuanyin a bodhisattva of compassion and Hotei the Laughing Buddha New Buddhist material continued to enter China with a big spike in the Tang dynasty when the monk Xuanzang brought over 600 texts from India Over time Guanyin also became a Daoist immortal and was the subject of much mythology Guanyin Guanyin is also known as Kwan Yin Guanshiyin the Goddess of Mercy and many other names The mythology around Guanyin is twofold one based on the AvalokitasvaraAvalokitevara tradition from India and one based on an alleged Chinese young womans life as appears in the legend of Miaoshan Guanyin is worshiped as a goddess yet has a most impressive mythological rsum Many myths and legends exist about Guan Yin In all of them she is exceptionally compassionate Kitigarbha Kitigarbha was a Buddhist deity from the area of India who was renamed Dizang In China He usually appears as a monk with a halo around his shaved head he carries a staff to force open the gates of hell and a wishfulfilling jewel to light up the darkness Four Heavenly Kings There are a group known as the Four Heavenly Kings one for each cardinal direction Statues of them can be encountered in the Hall of the Heavenly Kings of many Buddhist temples Laughing Buddha The depiction of a fat laughing Buddha developed in China Confucian influence A major factor in Chinese mythology is shown in the development of the tradition known as Confucianism named after a writer and school master who lived around 551479 BCE Confucius embraced the traditions of ancestor veneration He came to be a major figure of worship in Daoism which had its genesis in traditional Chinese religion The legitimacy of the Confucian movement was bolstered by the claim that its origins could be found in the mythology often claimed to be history of Yao and Shun Sharing between folk religion and mythology Modern and ancient Chinese culture had plenty of room for both religion and mythology Certain deities or spirits receive special attention These include divinities of wealth longevity fertility Mythologically it is possible to attain many desires through ritual activity involved with mythological themes For example many stores and restaurants in China or of the Chinese diaspora have shrines to Guan Yu also known as Guandi Guandi Guandi began as a Three Kingdoms general Guan Yu Over the subsequent centuries Guan Yu became promoted by official decree to be the god Guandi He is a god primarily of brotherhood and social organizations such as businesses although this is sometimes seen in connection with martial power and war According to mythology Guan Yu made a famous covenant of brotherhood in a peach orchard Three Star deities Star God of Longevity An example of Sharing between folk religion and mythology is the Star God of Longevity Afterlife and family Much Chinese mythology concerns the afterlife explaining what happens to people after they die This is related to ancestor veneration the mythological geography of heaven and hell the rituals at family tombs and so on Immortals xin Sometimes in mythology certain humans develop the ability to live indefinitely avoiding death and becoming divine xin Such humans generally also are said to develop special powers Generally these abilities are said to develop through such practices of Chinese alchemy obtaining an Elixir of life andor various austerities of diet or sexuality Symbolic associations with immortality include a spotted deer cranes the Lingzhi mushroom and a gourd and bat often Immortals are mythologically located in Mountain Paradises such as Kunlun Various common English translations of xin exist such as Immortal Fairy and Sage An example of a Daoist immortal is Wong Tai Sin who began as a fourth century CE hermit and developed into a divine healer Magu Magu is a legendary Taoist xian transcendent still currently worshiped Magu is associated with the elixir of life and is a symbolic protector of females in Chinese mythology Stories in Chinese literature describe Magu as a beautiful young woman with long birdlike fingernails while early myths associate her with caves Magus name literally compounds two common Chinese words ma cannabis hemp and gu aunt maid Ghosts or spirits of the deceased Common beliefs and stories in Chinese mythology involve a soul or spirit that survives after the death of someones body There are many types Living dead Jiangshi are a type of reanimated corpse Zhong Kui In the mythological folklore Zhong Kui is regarded as a vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings He committed suicide upon being unfairly stripped of his title of Zhuangyuan topscorer of the Imperial Examinations by the emperor due to his disfigured and ugly appearance His spirit was condemned to Hell because suicide was considered a grave sin but Yama the Chinese Hell King judged him worthy of the title King of Ghosts in Diyu Hell Yama tasked him to hunt capture take charge of and maintain discipline and order of all ghosts On Chinese New Years eve Zhong Kui returned to his hometown to repay the kindness of his friend Du Ping Holidays and festival rituals Abundant mythology is associated with religious holidays and folk festivals Qingming Festival The Qingming festival is a good example of a Chinese holiday that involves family activities associated with a seasonallyrecurring annual event and also ancestor veneration Qixi Festival The seasonallyrecurring annual holiday of Qixi involves love and romance A main mythological tale is The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl Weather deities Various deities or spirits are associated with weather phenomena such as drought or thunder Dragons are often associated with rain Examples include the deity or mythological person Ba also known as Hnb or

heaven to use her drought power to defeat their wind and rain powers She is one of the first goddesses attested to in Chinese literature appearing in the early collection of poetry the Shijing as well as in the later Shanhaijing At least up through the middle of the twentieth century ceremonies to produce rain were held in many regions of China The basic idea of these ceremonies which could last several hours was to drive Ba out of the region Another example is Lei Gong god of thunder Astronomical deities Various goddesses gods or spirits are especially associated with certain astronomical

of Chiyou Major sources Some myths survive in theatrical or literary formats as plays or novels others are still collected from the oral traditions of China and surrounding areas Other material can be gleaned from examining various other artifacts such as Chinese ritual bronzes ceramics paintings silk tapestries and elements of Chinese architecture The oldest written sources of Chinese mythology are short inscriptions rather than literature as such The earliest written evidence is found in the Oracle bone script written on scapulae or tortoise plastrons in the process of the divination practices Shang dynasty ended approximately 1046 BCE A copious and eclectic source of information on Chinese mythology is the written materials recovered from the Dunhuang manuscripts library now scattered in libraries around the world Shells and bones The earliest known written inscriptions of Chinese mythology are found on the shells and bones from about 3000 years before present These shells and bones were inscribed with records of divinatory processes during the late Shang dynasty also known as the Yin dynasty after its capital at Yin near modern Anyang in Hebei province The use of these artifacts in the study of mythology is limited to fragmentary references such as names at best No actual mythological narrative is known from the Shang oracle bones and shells Bronzes Very ancient bronze pieces have also been found especially beginning in the Zhou dynasty founded about 3000 years before present with allusions or short descriptions adding to modern knowledge of Ancient Chinese mythology The sacred or magical attitude towards some of these cast inscriptions is shown in that they sometimes appear in places almost inaccessible to being read such as the inside of a vessel often quite large and heavy often covered with a lid and perhaps meant to store food However there was a widespread belief that such writings were read by gods or spirits One such vessel a xu with the characters appearing on the insidebottom is a Zhou bronze with a 98character description of the deeds of Yu draining the flood Literary sources Various Chinese literature addresses the subject area of Chinese mythology In some cases some preservation of mythology occurs either deliberately or incidentally In other cases the mythology inspires literary works which are not strictly of a mythological nature for example works of fiction didactic works of philosophy or more modernly computer games and the names associated with Chinese explorations into outer space the deep ocean or the north and south polar regions Approaching a rough organization of the topic of literature relating to Chinese mythology may be chronologic The early textual materials mainly survive from the later Zhou dynasty that is Eastern Zhou from about 450 to 221 BCE Although these texts are relatively less editorial treated than some later texts they are not the same as the original preliterary myths The next major period of textual sources for Chinese mythology dates from the start of the Qin dynasty 221 BCE through the end of the Han dynasty 220 CE and continuing through the end of the subsequent periods of disunity 581 CE The surviving texts from this era often reflect evolution of the mythological substratum Beginning with the establishment of the Sui dynasty and continuing through the subsequent Tang dynasty Song dynasty and Ming dynasty ended 1644 During this period Chinese mythology developed into what now may be considered to be its traditional form The Song literature is particularly valuable for the often verbatim transcriptions of mythological material from otherwise unpreserved earlier sources In modern times Chinese mythology has both become the subject of global study and inspiration including popular culture Chuci and poetry sources Some information on Chinese mythology is found in the verse poetry associated with the ancient state of Chu such as Lisao Jiu Ge and Heavenly Questions contained in the Chuci anthology traditionally attributed to the authorship of Qu Yuan of Chu The Chuci together with some of its commentaries in the form known today was compiled during Han but contains some older material dating back at least to the waning days of the Zhou dynasty the Warring States period prior to the 221 BCE defeat of Chu state during the rise of the Qin dynasty Later poetic sources also address this mythology as a continuation of this poetic tradition for example Tang poetry Zhou dynasty literature Some information can be found in the Confucian Classics such as the Shijing and Yijing and other Zhou dynasty era material especially Book of Rites but also the Lshi Chunqiu The Book of Documents contains some Chinese myths Literature of QinHan to Sui Han dynasty The Han dynasty existed from 206 BCE 220 CE with a brief intermission separating it into two halves Han was preceded by the shortlived Qin dynasty 221 to 206 BC which has some important surviving literature In the Qin and Han periods besides the Chuci useful historical documents include the Records of the Grand Historian completed by Han historian Sima Qian before his death in about 220 CE Legends were passed down for over a thousand years before being written in books such as Classic of Mountains and Seas Shanhaijing basically a gazetteer mixing known and mythological geography Another major Han source on mythology is the Huainanzi PostHan preSui disunity period The mythologically relevant book Soushen Ji dates to the Jin dynasty 266420 during the Sixteen Kingdoms era Also known as In Search of the Supernatural and A Record of Researches into Spirits it is a 4thcentury compilation of stories and hearsay concerning spirits ghosts and supernatural phenomena some of which being of mythological importance including a great deal of preHan mythological narrative Sui Tang and Ming Tang dynasty The Tang dynasty had a flourishing literature including prose and poetry involving mythological content One important partiallysurviving work is Duyizhi by Li Rong Song dynasty Surviving Song dynasty literature informative on Chinese mythology includes the encyclopedic work known as Taiping Yulan Vernacular novels and new media Some myths were passed down through oral traditions literature and art such as theater and song before being recorded as novels One example is Epic of Darkness Books in the shenmo genre of vernacular fiction revolve around gods and monsters Important mythological fiction which allude to these myths include Fengshen Bang Investiture of the Gods a mythological fiction dealing with the founding of the Zhou dynasty Journey to the West attributed to Wu Chengen published in the 1590s a fictionalized account of the pilgrimage of Xuanzang to India to obtain Buddhist religious texts in which the main character and his companions such as Sun Wukong encounter ghosts monsters and demons as well as the Flaming Mountains and Baishe Zhuan Madame White Snake a romantic tale set in Hangzhou involving a female snake who attained human form and fell in love with a man Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio by Pu Songling contains many stories of fox spirits and other phenomena Another example is Zi Bu Yu a collection of supernatural stories compiled during the Qing dynasty Literary genres Certain genres of literature are notable for dealing with themes from mythology or tales of the supernatural for example the Zhiguai literary genre that deals with strange mostly supernatural events and stories India The literature of India contains material about Chinese mythology due to the influence of textual sources imported into China and translated into Chinese and the ideas widely adopted by Chinese people This was primarily in regard to Buddhist texts containing Buddhist mythology from the area in and around the area now known as India Some Hindu material may have been more directly imported Comparative mythology Many insights have developed through the examination of Chinese mythology as part of the field of comparative mythology which is the comparison of myths from different cultures in order to identify shared themes motifs or other features Early exponents of comparative mythology which are informative to the study of Chinese mythology include Georges Dumzil and James Frazer Ancient Chinese myths from various family and people groups survived for hundreds of years after they were first told and were integrated into Chinese Manichaeism In popular culture Thousands of years of the development of Chinese mythology has resulted in Chinese mythology in popular culture in the sense of popular culture affected or inspired by this tradition This includes television shows cinema and video games Also many of the vehicles associated with the modern Chinese space program are named after mythology such as the lunar explorer Change 4 that achieved the first soft landing on the far side of the Moon on 3 January 2019 and named after the lunar goddess Change associated and with a communications relay satellite Queqiao named after the lovers bridge over the Milky Way formed

    title: "Middle Ages",
    originalContent:
      "In the history of Europe the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted approximately from the 5th to the late 15th centuries similarly to the Postclassical period of global history It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and transitioned into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history classical antiquity the medieval period and the modern period The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early High and Late Middle Ages Population decline counterurbanisation the collapse of centralized authority invasions and mass migrations of tribes which had begun in Late Antiquity continued into the Early Middle Ages The largescale movements of the Migration Period including various Germanic peoples formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire In the 7th century North Africa and the Middle Eastonce part of the Byzantine Empirecame under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate an Islamic empire after conquest by Muhammads successors Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures the break with classical antiquity was not complete The stillsizeable Byzantine Empire Romes direct continuation survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power The empires law code the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian was rediscovered in Northern Italy in the 11th century In the West most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued The Franks under the Carolingian dynasty briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th centuries It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions Vikings from the north Magyars from the east and Saracens from the south During the High Middle Ages which began after 1000 the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase Manorialism the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles and feudalism the political structure whereby knights and lowerstatus nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors were two of the ways society was organized in the High Middle Ages This period also saw the collapse of the unified Christian church with the EastWest Schism of 1054 The Crusades first preached in 1095 were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims Kings became the heads of centralised nationstates reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason and by the founding of universities The theology of Thomas Aquinas the paintings of Giotto the poetry of Dante and Chaucer the travels of Marco Polo and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages The Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine plague and war which significantly diminished the population of Europe between 1347 and 1350 the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans Controversy heresy and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict civil strife and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms Cultural and technological developments transformed European society concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period Terminology and periodisation The Middle Ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing European history classical civilisation or Antiquity the Middle Ages and the Modern Period The Middle Ages first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or middle season In early usage there were many variants including medium aevum or middle age first recorded in 1604 and media saecula or middle centuries first recorded in 1625 The adjective medieval or sometimes mediaeval or medival meaning pertaining to the Middle Ages derives from medium aevum Medieval writers divided history into periods such as the Six Ages or the Four Empires and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world When referring to their own times they spoke of them as being modern In the 1330s the Italian humanist and poet Petrarch referred to preChristian times as antiqua or ancient and to the Christian period as nova or new Petrarch regarded the postRoman centuries as dark compared to the light of classical antiquity Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People 1442 with a middle period between the fall of the Roman Empire and the revival of city life sometime in late eleventh and twelfth centuries Tripartite periodisation became standard after the 17thcentury German historian Christoph Cellarius divided history into three periods ancient medieval and modern The most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is around 500 with the date of 476 first used by Bruni Later starting dates are sometimes used in the outer parts of Europe For Europe as a whole 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages but there is no universally agreed upon end date Depending on the context events such as the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 Christopher Columbuss first voyage to the Americas in 1492 or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period For Spain dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516 the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504 or the conquest of Granada in 1492 Historians from Romancespeaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts an earlier High and later Low period Englishspeaking historians following their German counterparts generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals Early High and Late In the 19th century the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the Dark Ages but with the adoption of these subdivisions use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages at least among historians Later Roman Empire The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories Economic issues including inflation and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century mainly in response to the war with the Sasanian Empire which revived in the middle of the 3rd century The army doubled in size and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial or landowning class and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army which led to complaints from civilians that there were more taxcollectors in the empire than taxpayers The Emperor Diocletian r 284305 split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286 the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other In 330 after a period of civil war Constantine the Great r 306337 refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital Constantinople Diocletians reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy reformed taxation and strengthened the army which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing excessive taxation a declining birthrate and pressures on its frontiers among others Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century diverting soldiers from the empires frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach For much of the 4th century Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period with a widening gulf between the rich and poor and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns Another change was the Christianisation or conversion of the empire to Christianity a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries In 376 the Goths fleeing from the Huns received permission from Emperor Valens r 364378 to settle in the Roman province of Thracia in the Balkans The settlement did not go smoothly and when Roman officials mishandled the situation the Goths began to raid and plunder Valens attempting to put down the disorder was killed fighting the Goths at the Battle of Adrianople on 9 August 378 In addition to the threat from such tribal confederacies in the north internal divisions within the empire especially within the Christian Church caused problems In 400 the Visigoths invaded the Western Roman Empire and although briefly forced back from Italy in 410 sacked the city of Rome In 406 the Alans Vandals and Suevi crossed into Gaul over the next three years they spread across Gaul and in 409 crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into modernday Spain The Migration Period began when various peoples initially largely Germanic peoples moved across Europe The Franks Alemanni and the Burgundians all ended up in northern Gaul while the Angles Saxons and Jutes settled in Britain and the Vandals went on to cross the strait of Gibraltar after which they conquered the province of Africa In the 430s the Huns began invading the empire their king Attila r 434453 led invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447 Gaul in 451 and Italy in 452 The Hunnic threat remained until Attilas death in 453 when the Hunnic confederation he led fell apart These invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the Western Roman Empire By the end of the 5th century the western section of the empire was divided into smaller political units ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early part of the century The deposition of the last emperor of the west Romulus Augustulus in 476 has traditionally marked the end of the Western Roman Empire By 493 the Italian peninsula was conquered by the Ostrogoths The Eastern Roman Empire often referred to as the Byzantine Empire after the fall of its western counterpart had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories The Byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory but while none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west Byzantine control of most of the Western Empire could not be sustained the reconquest of the Mediterranean periphery and the Italian Peninsula Gothic War in the reign of Justinian r 527565 was the sole and temporary exception Early Middle Ages New societies The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as invasions they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire Such movements were aided by the refusal of the Western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho d 408 Aetius d 454 Aspar d 471 Ricimer d 472 or Gundobad d 516 who were partly or fully of nonRoman background When the line of Western emperors ceased many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes instead relying on granting them land or rents This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms Slavery declined as the supply weakened and society became more rural Between the 5th and 8th centuries new peoples and individuals filled the political void left by Roman centralised government The Ostrogoths a Gothic tribe settled in Roman Italy in the late fifth century under Theoderic the Great d 526 and set up a kingdom marked by its cooperation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths at least until the last years of Theodorics reign The Burgundians settled in Gaul and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the Huns in 436 formed a new kingdom in the 440s Between todays Geneva and Lyon it grew to become the realm of Burgundy in the late 5th and early 6th centuries Elsewhere in Gaul the Franks and Celtic Britons set up small polities Francia was centred in northern Gaul and the first king of whom much is known is Childeric I d 481 His grave was discovered in 1653 and is remarkable for its grave goods which included weapons and a large quantity of gold Under Childerics son Clovis I r 509511 the founder of the Merovingian dynasty the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity The Britons related to the natives of Britannia modernday Great Britain settled in what is now Brittany Other monarchies were established by the Visigothic Kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula the Suebi in northwestern Iberia and the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa In the sixth century the Lombards settled in Northern Italy replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over them all By the late sixth century this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy the Kingdom of the Lombards The invasions brought new ethnic groups to Europe although some regions received a larger influx of new peoples than others In Gaul for instance the invaders settled much more extensively in the northeast than in the southwest Slavs settled in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages Latin the literary language of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by vernacular languages which evolved from Latin but were distinct from it collectively known as Romance languages These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavic languages to Eastern Europe Byzantine survival As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire most occurred in the Balkans Peace with the Sasanian Empire the traditional enemy of Rome lasted throughout most of the 5th century The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe Legal developments included the codification of Roman law the first effortthe Codex Theodosianuswas completed in 438 Under Emperor Justinian r 527565 another compilation took placethe Corpus Juris Civilis Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths under Belisarius d 565 The conquest of Italy was not complete as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinians reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests At the Emperors death the Byzantines had control of most of Italy North Africa and a small foothold in southern Spain Justinians reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the early Muslim conquests but many of the difficulties faced by Justinians successors were due not just to overtaxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire which made raising troops difficult In the Eastern Empire the slow infiltration of the Balkans by the Slavs added a further difficulty for Justinians successors It began gradually but by the late 540s Slavic tribes were in Thrace and Illyrium and had defeated an imperial army near Adrianople in 551 In the 560s the Avars began to expand from their base on the north bank of the Danube by the end of the 6thcentury they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the Eastern emperors to pay tribute They remained a strong power until 796 An additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of Emperor Maurice r 582602 in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute This led to a period of peace but when Maurice was overthrown the Persians invaded and during the reign of Emperor Heraclius r 610641 controlled large chunks of the empire including Egypt Syria and Anatolia until Heraclius successful counterattack In 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories Western society In Western Europe some of the older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with ecclesiastical than secular affairs Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared and while literacy remained important it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status In the 4th century Jerome d 420 dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible By the 6th century Gregory of Tours d 594 had a similar dream but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero he was chastised for learning shorthand By the late 6th century the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship but some original works were created along with nowlost oral compositions The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris d 489 Cassiodorus d c 585 and Boethius d c 525 were typical of the age Changes also took place among laymen as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces Family ties within the elites were important as were the virtues of loyalty courage and honour These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul In AngloSaxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy Land settlement also varied greatly Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems Unlike in the late Roman period there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat and it was possible for a free peasants family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord Roman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages Although Italian cities remained inhabited they contracted significantly in size Rome for instance shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30000 by the end of the 6th century Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use In Northern Europe cities also shrank while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity Officially they were tolerated if subject to conversion efforts and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas Rise of Islam Religious beliefs in the Eastern Roman Empire and Iran were in flux during the late sixth and early seventh centuries Judaism was an active proselytising faith and at least one Arab political leader converted to it In addition Jewish theologians wrote polemics defending their religion against Christian and Islamic influences Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians Zoroastrianism in seeking converts especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad d 632 After his death Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia starting with Syria in 634635 continuing with Persia between 637 and 642 reaching Egypt in 640641 North Africa in the later seventh century and the Iberian Peninsula in 711 By 714 Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called AlAndalus The Islamic conquests reached their peak in the mideighth century The defeat of Muslim forces at the Battle of Tours in 732 led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate and its replacement by the Abbasid Caliphate The Abbasids moved their capital to Baghdad and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe losing control of sections of the Muslim lands Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula the Aghlabids controlled North Africa and the Tulunids became rulers of Egypt By the middle of the 8th century new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old Roman economy Franks traded timber furs swords and slaves in return for silks and other fabrics spices and precious metals from the Arabs Trade and economy The migrations and invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries disrupted trade networks around the Mediterranean African goods stopped being imported into Europe first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples By the end of the 7th century under the impact of the Muslim conquests African products were no longer found in Western Europe The replacement of goods from longrange trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean such as northern Gaul or Britain Nonlocal goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods In the northern parts of Europe not only were the trade networks local but the goods carried were simple with little pottery or other complex products Around the Mediterranean pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over mediumrange networks not just produced locally The various Germanic states in the west all had coinages that imitated existing Roman and Byzantine forms Gold continued to be minted until the end of the 7th century in 69394 when it was replaced by silver in the Merovingian kingdom The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier while the AngloSaxon version was called a penny From these areas the denier or penny spread throughout Europe from 700 to 1000 AD Copper or bronze coins were not struck nor were gold except in Southern Europe No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted Church and monasticism Christianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe before the Arab conquests but the conquest of North Africa sundered maritime connections between those areas Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language practices and liturgy from the Western Church The Eastern Church used Greek instead of the Western Latin Theological and political differences emerged and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm clerical marriage and state control of the Church had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities The formal break known as the EastWest Schism came in 1054 when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other which led to the division of Christianity into two Churchesthe Western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern branch the Eastern Orthodox Church The ecclesiastical structure of the Roman Empire survived the movements and invasions in the west mostly intact but the papacy was little regarded and few of the Western bishops looked to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership Many of the popes prior to 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and Eastern theological controversies The register or archived copies of the letters of Pope Gregory the Great pope 590604 survived and of those more than 850 letters the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in 597 to convert the AngloSaxons to Christianity Irish missionaries were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries going first to England and Scotland and then on to the continent Under such monks as Columba d 597 and Columbanus d 615 they founded monasteries taught in Latin and Greek and authored secular and religious works The Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of monasticism in the West The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Syria Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life called cenobitism which was pioneered by Pachomius d 348 in the 4th century Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the Life of Anthony Benedict of Nursia d 547 wrote the Benedictine Rule for Western monasticism during the 6th century detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an abbot Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions and bases for missions and proselytisation They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics were copied in monasteries in the Early Middle Ages Monks were also the authors of new works including history theology and other subjects written by authors such as Bede d 735 a native of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th centuries Carolingian Europe The Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia Neustria and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries all of them ruled by the Merovingian dynasty who were descended from Clovis The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria Such warfare was exploited by Pippin d 640 the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne Later members of his family inherited the office acting as advisers and regents One of his descendants Charles Martel d 741 won the Battle of Poitiers in 732 halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria Mercia Wessex and East Anglia which descended from the AngloSaxon invaders Smaller kingdoms in presentday Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts Ireland was divided into even smaller political units usually known as tribal kingdoms under the control of kings There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland of varying importance The Carolingian dynasty as the successors to Charles Martel are known officially took control of the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria in a coup of 753 led by Pippin III r 752768 A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought and gained authority for this coup from Pope Stephen II pope 752757 Pippins takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel and circulated stories of the familys great piety At the time of his death in 768 Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons Charles r 768814 and Carloman r 768771 When Carloman died of natural causes Charles blocked the succession of Carlomans young son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria Charles more often known as Charles the Great or Charlemagne embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion in 774 that unified a large portion of Europe eventually controlling modernday France northern Italy and Saxony In the wars that lasted beyond 800 he rewarded allies with war booty and command over parcels of land In 774 Charlemagne conquered the Lombards which freed the papacy from the fear of Lombard conquest and marked the beginnings of the Papal States The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history marking a return of the Western Roman Empire since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the Western emperors It also marks a change in Charlemagnes relationship with the Byzantine Empire as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire The Frankish lands were rural in character with only a few small cities Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts who administered the counties the empire had been divided into Clergy and local bishops served as officials as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters Carolingian Renaissance Charlemagnes court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the Carolingian Renaissance Literacy increased as did development in the arts architecture and jurisprudence as well as liturgical and scriptural studies The English monk Alcuin d 804 was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria Charlemagnes chanceryor writing officemade use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying correcting and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics with the aim of encouraging learning New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the Church and government By the reign of Charlemagne the language had so diverged from the classical Latin that it was later called Medieval Latin Breakup of the Carolingian Empire Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs but was unable to do so as only one son Louis the Pious r 814840 was still alive by 813 Just before Charlemagne died in 814 he crowned Louis as his successor Louiss reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and after 829 civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire Eventually Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I d 855 as emperor and gave him Italy Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald d 877 his youngest son Lothair took East Francia comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps Louis the German d 876 the middle child who had been rebellious to the last was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother The division was disputed Pepin II of Aquitaine d after 864 the emperors grandson rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia Louis the Pious died in 840 with the empire still in chaos A threeyear civil war followed his death By the Treaty of Verdun 843 a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy and his imperial title was recognised Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modernday Germany Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands comprising most of modernday France Charlemagnes grandsons and greatgrandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands with the crowning of Hugh Capet r 987996 as king In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier in 911 with the death of Louis the Child and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I r 911918 as king The breakup of the Carolingian Empire was accompanied by invasions migrations and raids by external foes The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings who also raided the British Isles and settled there as well as in Iceland In 911 the Viking chieftain Rollo d c 931 received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple r 898922 to settle in what became Normandy The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms especially Germany and Italy were under continual Magyar assault until the invaders defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 The breakup of the Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms New kingdoms and Byzantine revival Efforts by local kings to fight the invaders led to the formation of new political entities In AngloSaxon England King Alfred the Great r 871899 came to an agreement with the Viking invaders in the late 9th century resulting in Danish settlements in Northumbria Mercia and parts of East Anglia By the middle of the 10th century Alfreds successors had conquered Northumbria and restored English control over most of the southern part of Great Britain In northern Britain Kenneth MacAlpin d c 860 united the Picts and the Scots into the Kingdom of Alba In the early 10th century the Ottonian dynasty had established itself in Germany and was engaged in driving back the Magyars Its efforts culminated in the coronation in 962 of Otto I r 936973 as Holy Roman Emperor In 972 he secured recognition of his title by the Byzantine Empire which he sealed with the marriage of his son Otto II r 967983 to Theophanu d 991 daughter of an earlier Byzantine Emperor Romanos II r 959963 By the late 10th century Italy had been drawn into the Ottonian sphere after a period of instability Otto III r 9961002 spent much of his later reign in the kingdom The western Frankish kingdom was more fragmented and although kings remained nominally in charge much of the political power devolved to the local lords Missionary efforts to Scandinavia during the 9th and 10th centuries helped strengthen the growth of kingdoms such as Sweden Denmark and Norway which gained power and territory Some kings converted to Christianity although not all by 1000 Scandinavians also expanded and colonised throughout Europe Besides the settlements in Ireland England and Normandy further settlement took place in what became Russia and Iceland Swedish traders and raiders ranged down the rivers of the Russian steppe and even attempted to seize Constantinople in 860 and 907 Christian Spain initially driven into a small section of the peninsula in the north expanded slowly south during the 9th and 10th centuries establishing the kingdoms of Asturias and Len In Eastern Europe Byzantium revived its fortunes under Emperor Basil I r 867886 and his successors Leo VI r 886912 and Constantine VII r 913959 members of the Macedonian dynasty Commerce revived and the emperors oversaw the extension of a uniform administration to all the provinces The military was reorganised which allowed the emperors John I r 969976 and Basil II r 9761025 to expand the frontiers of the empire on all fronts The imperial court was the centre of a revival of classical learning a process known as the Macedonian Renaissance Writers such as John Geometres fl early 10th century composed new hymns poems and other works Missionary efforts by both Eastern and Western clergy resulted in the conversion of the Moravians Bulgars Bohemians Poles Magyars and Slavic inhabitants of the Kievan Rus These conversions contributed to the founding of political states in the lands of those peoplesthe states of Moravia Bulgaria Bohemia Poland Hungary and the Kievan Rus Bulgaria which was founded around 680 at its height reached from Budapest to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River in modern Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea By 1018 the last Bulgarian nobles had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire Art and architecture Few large stone buildings were constructed between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the 8th century although many smaller ones were built during the 6th and 7th centuries By the beginning of the 8th century the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept or the arms of a crossshaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave Other new features of religious architecture include the crossing tower and a monumental entrance to the church usually at the west end of the building Carolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court and the monasteries and churches they supported It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and AngloSaxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair several reliquaries and finds such as the AngloSaxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmikls near Byzantine territory There are survivals from the large brooches in fibula or penannular form that were a key piece of personal adornment for elites including the Irish Tara Brooch Highly decorated books were mostly Gospel Books and these have survived in larger numbers including the Insular Book of Kells the Book of Lindisfarne and the imperial Codex Aureus of St Emmeram which is one of the few to retain its treasure binding of gold encrusted with jewels Charlemagnes court seems to have been responsible for the acceptance of figurative monumental sculpture in Christian art and by the end of the period near lifesized figures such as the Gero Cross were common in important churches Military and technological developments During the later Roman Empire the principal military developments were attempts to create an effective cavalry force as well as the continued development of highly specialised types of troops The creation of heavily armoured cataphracttype soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5thcentury Roman military The various invading tribes had differing emphases on types of soldiersranging from the primarily infantry AngloSaxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies During the early invasion period the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier and weaker Scythian composite bow Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry The use of militiatype levies of the free population declined over the Carolingian period Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted a large proportion during the early period appear to have been mounted infantry rather than true cavalry One exception was AngloSaxon England where the armies were still composed of regional levies known as the fyrd which were led by the local elites In military technology one of the main changes was the return of the crossbow which had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during the last part of the Early Middle Ages Another change was the introduction of the stirrup which increased the effectiveness of cavalry as shock troops A technological advance that had implications beyond the military was the horseshoe which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain High Middle Ages Society and economic life The High Middle Ages was a period of tremendous expansion of population The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347 although the exact causes remain unclear improved agricultural techniques the decline of slaveholding a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities usually known as manors or villages These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services in a system known as manorialism There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north The practice of assarting or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them also contributed to the expansion of population The openfield system of agriculture was commonly practiced in most of Europe especially in northwestern and central Europe Such agricultural communities had three basic characteristics individual peasant holdings in the form of strips of land were scattered among the different fields belonging to the manor crops were rotated from year to year to preserve soil fertility and common land was used for grazing livestock and other purposes Some regions used a threefield system of crop rotation others retained the older twofield system Other sections of society included the nobility clergy and townsmen Nobles both the titled nobility and simple knights exploited the manors and the peasants although they did not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of feudalism During the 11th and 12th centuries these lands or fiefs came to be considered hereditary and in most areas they were no longer divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period Instead most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land its military service as heavy cavalry control of castles and various immunities from taxes or other impositions Castles initially in wood but later in stone began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords Nobles were stratified kings and the highestranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land as well as other nobles Beneath them lesser nobles had authority over smaller areas of land and fewer people Knights were the lowest level of nobility they controlled but did not own land and had to serve other nobles The clergy was divided into two types the secular clergy who lived out in the world and the regular clergy who lived isolated under a religious rule and usually consisted of monks Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population usually less than one percent Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position as they did not fit into the traditional threefold division of society into nobles clergy and peasants During the 12th and 13th centuries the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 percent of the total population Jews also spread across Europe during the period Communities were established in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries but Spanish Jews long settled in Spain under the Muslims came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity Most Jews were confined to the cities as they were not allowed to own land or be peasants Besides the Jews there were other nonChristians on the edges of Europepagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe Women in the Middle Ages were officially required to be subordinate to some male whether their father husband or other kinsman Widows who were often allowed much control over their own lives were still restricted legally Womens work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household childcare as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home At harvesttime they were also expected to help with fieldwork Townswomen like peasant women were responsible for the household and could also engage in trade What trades were open to women varied by country and period Noblewomen were responsible for running a household and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns as they were unable to become priests In central and northern Italy and in Flanders the rise of towns that were to a degree selfgoverning stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice Genoa and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders Marco Polo d 1324 Besides new trading opportunities agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money and gold coinage was again minted in Europe first in Italy and later in France and other countries New forms of commercial contracts emerged allowing risk to be shared among merchants Accounting methods improved partly through the use of doubleentry bookkeeping letters of credit also appeared allowing easy transmission of money Rise of state power The High Middle Ages was the formative period in the history of the modern Western state Kings in France England and Spain consolidated their power and set up lasting governing institutions New kingdoms such as Hungary and Poland after their conversion to Christianity became Central European powers The Magyars settled Hungary around 900 under King rpd d c 907 after a series of invasions in the 9th century The papacy long attached to an ideology of independence from secular kings first asserted its claim to temporal authority over the entire Christian world the Papal Monarchy reached its apogee in the early 13th century under the pontificate of Innocent III pope 11981216 Northern Crusades and the advance of Christian kingdoms and military orders into previously pagan regions in the Baltic and Finnic northeast brought the forced assimilation of numerous native peoples into European culture During the early High Middle Ages Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period In 1024 they were replaced by the Salian dynasty who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV r 10841105 over Church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V r 111125 who died without heirs until Frederick I Barbarossa r 115590 took the imperial throne Although he ruled effectively the basic problems remained and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century Barbarossas grandson Frederick II r 12201250 who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother clashed repeatedly with the papacy His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy He and his successors faced many difficulties including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid13th century Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241 1259 and 1287 Under the Capetian dynasty the French monarchy slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility growing out of the ledeFrance to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy who in 1066 under William the Conqueror duke 10351087 conquered England r 106687 and created a crosschannel empire that lasted in various forms throughout the rest of the Middle Ages Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy when Robert Guiscard d 1085 landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily Under the Angevin dynasty of Henry II r 115489 and his son Richard I r 118999 the kings of England ruled over England and large areas of France brought to the family by Henry IIs marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine d 1204 heiress to much of southern France Richards younger brother John r 11991216 lost Normandy and the rest of the northern French possessions in 1204 to the French King Philip II Augustus r 11801223 This led to dissension among the English nobility while Johns financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain Normandy led in 1215 to Magna Carta a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in England Under Henry III r 121672 Johns son further concessions were made to the nobility and royal power was diminished The French monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries bringing more territories within the kingdom under the kings personal rule and centralising the royal administration Under Louis IX r 122670 royal prestige rose to new heights as Louis served as a mediator for most of Europe In Iberia the Christian states which had been confined to the northwestern part of the peninsula began to push back against the Islamic states in the south a period known as the Reconquista By about 1150 the Christian north had coalesced into the five major kingdoms of Len Castile Aragon Navarre and Portugal Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states initially under the Caliphate of Crdoba which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas who fought with the Christians until the Almohad Caliphate reestablished centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s Christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century culminating in the capture of Seville in 1248 Crusades In the 11th century the Seljuk Turks took over much of the Middle East occupying Persia during the 1040s Armenia in the 1060s and Jerusalem in 1070 In 1071 the Turkish army defeated the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert and captured the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV r 106871 The Turks were then free to invade Asia Minor which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat they never fully regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive The Turks also had difficulties losing control of Jerusalem to the Fatimids of Egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars The Byzantines also faced a revived Bulgaria which in the late 12th and 13th centuries spread throughout the Balkans The crusades were intended to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II pope 108899 at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos r 10811118 for aid against further Muslim advances Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099 One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East These were especially brutal during the First Crusade when the Jewish communities in Cologne Mainz and Worms were destroyed as well as other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and the Rhine Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers which fused monastic life with military service The crusaders consolidated their conquests into crusader states During the 12th and 13th centuries there were a series of conflicts between them and the surrounding Islamic states Appeals from the crusader states to the papacy led to further crusades such as the Third Crusade called to try to regain Jerusalem which had been captured by Saladin d 1193 in 1187 In 1203 the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Holy Land to Constantinople and captured the city in 1204 setting up a Latin Empire of Constantinople and greatly weakening the Byzantine Empire The Byzantines recaptured the city in 1261 but never regained their former strength By 1291 all the crusader states had been captured or forced from the mainland although a titular Kingdom of Jerusalem survived on the island of Cyprus for several years afterwards Popes called for crusades to take place elsewhere besides the Holy Land in Spain southern France and along the Baltic The Spanish crusades became fused with the Reconquista of Spain from the Muslims Although the Templars and Hospitallers took part in the Spanish crusades similar Spanish military religious orders were founded most of which had become part of the two main orders of Calatrava and Santiago by the beginning of the 12th century Northern Europe also remained outside Christian influence until the 11th century or later and became a crusading venue as part of the Northern Crusades of the 12th to 14th centuries These crusades also spawned a military order the Order of the Sword Brothers Another order the Teutonic Knights although founded in the crusader states focused much of its activity in the Baltic after 1225 and in 1309 moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia Intellectual life During the 11th century developments in philosophy and theology led to increased intellectual activity There was debate between the realists and the nominalists over the concept of universals Philosophical discourse was stimulated by the rediscovery of Aristotle and his emphasis on empiricism and rationalism Scholars such as Peter Abelard d 1142 and Peter Lombard d 1164 introduced Aristotelian logic into theology In the late 11th and early 12th centuries cathedral schools spread throughout Western Europe signalling the shift of learning from monasteries to cathedrals and towns Cathedral schools were in turn replaced by the universities established in major European cities Philosophy and theology fused in scholasticism an attempt by 12th and 13thcentury scholars to reconcile authoritative texts most notably Aristotle and the Bible This movement tried to employ a systemic approach to truth and reason and culminated in the thought of Thomas Aquinas d 1274 who wrote the Summa Theologica or Summary of Theology Chivalry and the ethos of courtly love developed in royal and noble courts This culture was expressed in the vernacular languages rather than Latin and comprised poems stories legends and popular songs spread by troubadours or wandering minstrels Often the stories were written down in the chansons de geste or songs of great deeds such as The Song of Roland or The Song of Hildebrand Secular and religious histories were also produced Geoffrey of Monmouth d c 1155 composed his Historia Regum Britanniae a collection of stories and legends about Arthur Other works were more clearly history such as Otto von Freisings d 1158 Gesta Friderici Imperatoris detailing the deeds of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa or William of Malmesburys d c 1143 Gesta Regum on the kings of England Legal studies advanced during the 12th century Both secular law and canon law or ecclesiastical law were studied in the High Middle Ages Secular law or Roman law was advanced greatly by the discovery of the Corpus Juris Civilis in the 11th century and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at Bologna This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe Canon law was also studied and around 1140 a monk named Gratian fl 12th century a teacher at Bologna wrote what became the standard text of canon lawthe Decretum Among the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra which allowed more advanced mathematics Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemys Almagest from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century Medicine was also studied especially in southern Italy where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno Technology and military In the 12th and 13th centuries Europe experienced economic growth and innovations in methods of production Major technological advances included the invention of the windmill the first mechanical clocks the manufacture of distilled spirits and the use of the astrolabe Concave spectacles were invented around 1286 by an unknown Italian artisan probably working in or near Pisa The development of a threefield rotation system for planting crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old twofield system to twothirds under the new system with a consequent increase in production The development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently aided by the spread of the horse collar which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture factors that aided the implementation of the threefield system Legumes such as peas beans or lentils were grown more widely as crops in addition to the usual cereal crops of wheat oats barley and rye The construction of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology leading to the development of large stone buildings Ancillary structures included new town halls houses bridges and tithe barns Shipbuilding improved with the use of the rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the sternpost rudder both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed In military affairs the use of infantry with specialised roles increased Along with the stilldominant heavy cavalry armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen as well as sappers and engineers Crossbows which had been known in Late Antiquity increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closedface helmets heavy body armour as well as horse armour Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304 although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s and handheld guns were in use by the 1360s Architecture art and music In the 10th century the establishment of churches and monasteries led to the development of stone architecture that elaborated vernacular Roman forms from which the term Romanesque is derived Where available Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials From the tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form Just before 1000 there was a great wave of building stone churches all over Europe Romanesque buildings have massive stone walls openings topped by semicircular arches small windows and particularly in France arched stone vaults The large portal with coloured sculpture in high relief became a central feature of faades especially in France and the capitals of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals According to art historian C R Dodwell virtually all the churches in the West were decorated with wallpaintings of which few survive Simultaneous with the development in church architecture the distinctive European form of the castle was developed and became crucial to politics and warfare Romanesque art especially metalwork was at its most sophisticated in Mosan art in which distinct artistic personalities including Nicholas of Verdun d 1205 become apparent and an almost classical style is seen in works such as a font at Lige contrasting with the writhing animals of the exactly contemporary Gloucester Candlestick Large illuminated bibles and psalters were the typical forms of luxury manuscripts and wallpainting flourished in churches often following a scheme with a Last Judgement on the west wall a Christ in Majesty at the east end and narrative biblical scenes down the nave or in the best surviving example at SaintSavinsurGartempe on the barrelvaulted roof From the early 12th century French builders developed the Gothic style marked by the use of rib vaults pointed arches flying buttresses and large stained glass windows It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches which continued to use extensive wallpaintings now almost all lost During this period the practice of manuscript illumination gradually passed from monasteries to lay workshops so that according to Janetta Benton by 1300 most monks bought their books in shops and the book of hours developed as a form of devotional book for laypeople Metalwork continued to be the most prestigious form of art with Limoges enamel a popular and relatively affordable option for objects such as reliquaries and crosses In Italy the innovations of Cimabue and Duccio followed by the Trecento master Giotto d 1337 greatly increased the sophistication and status of panel painting and fresco Increasing prosperity during the 12th century resulted in greater production of secular art many carved ivory objects such as gamingpieces combs and small religious figures have survived Church life Monastic reform became an important issue during the 11th century as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life Cluny Abbey founded in the Mcon region of France in 909 was established as part of the Cluniac Reforms a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords Monastic reform inspired change in the secular Church The ideals upon which it was based were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX pope 10491054 and provided the ideology of clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century This involved Pope Gregory VII pope 107385 and Emperor Henry IV who initially clashed over episcopal appointments a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture clerical marriage and simony The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands but the papacy insisted on the Churchs independence from secular lords These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors The High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms people sought to participate in new forms of religious life New monastic orders were founded including the Carthusians and the Cistercians The latter in particular expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux d 1153 These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity or to live an Apostolic life Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged Old pilgrimage sites such as Rome Jerusalem and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors and new sites such as Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence In the 13th century mendicant ordersthe Franciscans and the Dominicanswho swore vows of poverty and earned their living by begging were approved by the papacy Religious groups such as the Waldensians and the Humiliati also attempted to return to the life of early Christianity in the middle 12th and early 13th centuries another heretical movement condemned by the papacy Others joined the Cathars another movement condemned as heretical by the papacy In 1209 a crusade was preached against the Cathars the Albigensian Crusade which in combination with the medieval Inquisition eliminated them Late Middle Ages War famine and plague The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines culminating in the Great Famine of 131517 The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures The years 131314 and 131721 were excessively rainy throughout Europe resulting in widespread crop failures The climate changewhich resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th centurywas accompanied by an economic downturn These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death a pandemic that spread throughout Europe during the following three years The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe about onethird of the population Towns were especially hardhit because of their crowded conditions Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited and in some places fields were left unworked Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food both of which cut into agricultural income Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings and popular uprisings broke out across Europe Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France the Peasants Revolt in England and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe manifested by the foundation of new charities the selfmortification of the flagellants and the scapegoating of Jews Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages Society and economy Society throughout Europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the Black Death Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 percent by the end of the period Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments Partly at the urging of landlords governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death Nonclergy became increasingly literate and urban populations began to imitate the nobilitys interest in chivalry Jewish communities were expelled from England in 1290 and from France in 1306 Although some were allowed back into France most were not and many Jews emigrated eastwards settling in Poland and Hungary The Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 and dispersed to Turkey France Italy and Holland The rise of banking in Italy during the 13th century continued throughout the 14th century fuelled partly by the increasing warfare of the period and the needs of the papacy to move money between kingdoms Many banking firms loaned money to royalty at great risk as some were bankrupted when kings defaulted on their loans State resurgence Strong royaltybased nation states rose throughout Europe in the Late Middle Ages particularly in England France and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula Aragon Castile and Portugal The long conflicts of the period strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient and the rate of taxation often increased The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority Throughout the 14th century French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France leading to the Hundred Years War waged from 1337 to 1453 Early in the war the English under Edward III r 132777 and his son Edward the Black Prince d 1376 won the battles of Crcy and Poitiers captured the city of Calais and won control of much of France The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war In the early 15th century France again came close to dissolving but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc d 1431 led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453 The price was high as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict Conversely the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture which had previously been the dominant influence The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years War and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Crcy in 1346 In modernday Germany the Holy Roman Empire continued to rule but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form Further east the kingdoms of Poland Hungary and Bohemia grew powerful In Iberia the Christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns After losing the Hundred Years War England went on to suffer a long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when Henry Tudor r 14851509 as Henry VII became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III r 148385 at Bosworth in 1485 In Scandinavia Margaret I of Denmark r in Denmark 13871412 consolidated Norway Denmark and Sweden in the Union of Kalmar which continued until 1523 The major power around the Baltic Sea was the Hanseatic League a commercial confederation of citystates that traded from Western Europe to Russia Scotland emerged from English domination under Robert the Bruce r 130629 who secured papal recognition of his kingship in 1328 Collapse of Byzantium Although the Palaeologi emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261 they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople the city itself and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia the Second Bulgarian Empire and the citystate of Venice The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe the Ottomans who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century The Ottomans expanded into Europe reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396 a great army was sent to the Balkans where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453 Controversy within the Church During the tumultuous 14th century disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the Avignon Papacy of 130976 also called the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy a reference to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and then to the Great Schism lasting from 1378 to 1418 when there were two and later three rival popes each supported by several states Ecclesiastical officials convened at the Council of Constance in 1414 and in the following year the council deposed one of the rival popes leaving only two claimants Further depositions followed and in November 1417 the council elected Martin V pope 141731 as pope Besides the schism the Western Church was riven by theological controversies some of which turned into heresies John Wycliffe d 1384 an English theologian was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine Wycliffes teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance The Hussite Church although the target of a crusade survived beyond the Middle Ages Other heresies were manufactured such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV r 12851314 and the Hospitallers The papacy further refined the practice in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages veneration of relics and belief in the power of the Devil Mystics such as Meister Eckhart d 1327 and Thomas Kempis d 1471 wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation Besides mysticism belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum the most popular handbook for witchhunters Scholars intellectuals and exploration During the Later Middle Ages theologians such as John Duns Scotus d 1308 and William of Ockham d c 1348 led a reaction against intellectualist scholasticism objecting to the application of reason to faith Their efforts undermined the prevailing Platonic idea of universals Ockhams insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by customary law The lone exception to this trend was in England where the common law remained preeminent Other countries codified their laws legal codes were promulgated in Castile Poland and Lithuania Education remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest but the secondary subjects of the triviumgrammar rhetoric logicwere studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities Commercial secondary schools spread and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries Lay literacy rates rose but were still low one estimate gave a literacy rate of 10 per cent of males and 1 per cent of females in 1500 The publication of vernacular literature increased with Dante d 1321 Petrarch d 1374 and Giovanni Boccaccio d 1375 in 14thcentury Italy Geoffrey Chaucer d 1400 and William Langland d c 1386 in England and Franois Villon d 1464 and Christine de Pizan d c 1430 in France Much literature remained religious in character and although a great deal of it continued to be written in Latin a new demand developed for saints lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages This was fed by the growth of the Devotio Moderna movement most prominently in the formation of the Brethren of the Common Life but also in the works of German mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Johannes Tauler d 1361 Theatre also developed in the guise of miracle plays put on by the Church At the end of the period the development of the printing press in about 1450 led to the establishment of publishing houses throughout Europe by 1500 In the early 15th century the countries of the Iberian Peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal d 1460 sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands the Azores and Cape Verde during his lifetime After his death exploration continued Bartolomeu Dias d 1500 went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 and Vasco da Gama d 1524 sailed around Africa to India in 1498 The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus d 1506 in 1492 that discovered the Americas The English crown under Henry VII sponsored the voyage of John Cabot d 1498 in 1497 which landed on Cape Breton Island Technological and military developments One of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry The English also employed longbowmen but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success Armour continued to advance spurred by the increasing power of crossbows and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the handheld guns that were developed Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears In agriculture the increased usage of sheep with longfibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun In addition the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool tripling production A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily life was the use of buttons as closures for garments which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill allowing the upper part of the windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions Late medieval art and architecture The Late Middle Ages in Europe as a whole correspond to the Trecento and Early Renaissance cultural periods in Italy Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century until almost the end of the period International Gothic was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400 producing masterpieces such as the Trs Riches Heures du Duc de Berry All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality and in the 15th century the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons commissioning small portraits of themselves in oils as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery ivory caskets cassone chests and maiolica pottery These objects also included the HispanoMoresque ware produced by mostly Mudjar potters in Spain Although royalty owned huge collections of plate little survives except for the Royal Gold Cup Italian silk manufacture developed so that Western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world In France and Flanders tapestry weaving of sets like The Lady and the Unicorn became a major luxury industry The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in SantAndrea Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common especially as churches created many sidechapels Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck d 1441 and Rogier van der Weyden d 1464 rivalled that of Italy as did northern illuminated manuscripts which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites who also commissioned secular books especially histories From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular though still expensive There were around 30000 different editions of incunabula or works printed before 1500 by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others Very small woodcuts nearly all religious were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century More expensive engravings supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images Modern perceptions The medieval period is frequently caricatured as a time of ignorance and superstition that placed the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity This is a legacy from both the Renaissance and Enlightenment when scholars favourably contrasted their intellectual cultures with those of the medieval period Renaissance scholars saw the Middle Ages as a period of decline from the high culture and civilisation of the Classical world Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition Others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages Science historian Edward Grant writes If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed in the 18th century they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities Also contrary to common belief David Lindberg writes the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the Church and would have regarded himself as free particularly in the natural sciences to follow reason and observation wherever they led The caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions One misconception first propagated in the 19th century and still very common is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat This is untrue as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere Lindberg and Ronald Numbers another scholar of the period state that there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge Earths sphericity and even know its approximate circumference Other misconceptions such as the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science or the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth

    title: "World War I",
    originalContent:
      "World War I or the First World War 28 July 1914 11 November 1918 also known as the Great War was a global conflict between two coalitions the Allies or Entente and the Central Powers Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East as well as in parts of Africa and the AsiaPacific and in Europe was characterised by trench warfare the widespread use of artillery machine guns and chemical weapons gas and the introductions of tanks and aircraft World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history resulting in an estimated 10 million military dead and more than 20 million wounded plus some 10 million civilian dead from causes including genocide The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic The causes of World War I included the rise of Germany and decline of the Ottoman Empire which disturbed the longstanding balance of power in Europe as well as economic competition between nations triggered by industrialisation and imperialism Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914 when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand heir to the AustroHungarian throne AustriaHungary held Serbia responsible and declared war on 28 July After Russia mobilised in Serbias defence Germany declared war on Russia and France who had an alliance The United Kingdom entered after Germany invaded Belgium whose neutrality it guaranteed and the Ottomans joined the Central Powers in November Germanys strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France then to transfer its forces to the east but its advance was halted in September and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland The Eastern Front was more dynamic but neither side gained a decisive advantage despite costly offensives Italy Bulgaria Romania Greece and others joined in from 1915 onward In April 1917 the United States entered the war on the Allied side following Germanys resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against Atlantic shipping Later that year the Bolsheviks seized power in the Russian October Revolution and Soviet Russia signed an armistice with the Central Powers in December followed by a separate peace in March 1918 That month Germany launched an offensive in the west which despite initial successes left the German Army exhausted and demoralised A successful Allied counteroffensive from August 1918 caused a collapse of the German front line By early November Bulgaria the Ottoman Empire and AustriaHungary had each signed armistices with the Allies leaving Germany isolated Facing a revolution at home Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November and the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918 The Paris Peace Conference of 19191920 imposed settlements on the defeated powers most notably the Treaty of Versailles by which Germany lost significant territories was disarmed and was required to pay large war reparations to the Allies The dissolution of the Russian German AustroHungarian and Ottoman Empires redrew national boundaries and resulted in the creation of new independent states including Poland Finland the Baltic states Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia The League of Nations was established to maintain world peace but its failure to manage instability during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of World War II in 1939 Names Before World War II the events of 19141918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War In August 1914 the magazine The Independent wrote This is the Great War It names itself In October 1914 the Canadian magazine Macleans similarly wrote Some wars name themselves This is the Great War Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as the war to end war and it was also described as the war to end all wars due to their perception of its unparalleled scale devastation and loss of life The first recorded use of the term First World War was in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel who stated There is no doubt that the course and character of the feared European War will become the first world war in the full sense of the word Background Political and military alliances For much of the 19th century the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power known as the Concert of Europe After 1848 this was challenged by Britains withdrawal into socalled splendid isolation the decline of the Ottoman Empire New Imperialism and the rise of Prussia under Otto von Bismarck Victory in the 18701871 FrancoPrussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate a German Empire Post1871 the primary aim of French policy was to avenge this defeat but by the early 1890s this had switched to the expansion of the French colonial empire In 1873 Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors which included AustriaHungary Russia and Germany After the 18771878 RussoTurkish War the League was dissolved due to Austrian concerns over the expansion of Russian influence in the Balkans an area they considered to be of vital strategic interest Germany and AustriaHungary then formed the 1879 Dual Alliance which became the Triple Alliance when Italy joined in 1882 For Bismarck the purpose of these agreements was to isolate France by ensuring the three Empires resolve any disputes between themselves In 1887 Bismarck set up the Reinsurance Treaty a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by France or AustriaHungary For Bismarck peace with Russia was the foundation of German foreign policy but in 1890 he was forced to retire by Wilhelm II The latter was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by his new Chancellor Leo von Caprivi This gave France an opening to agree the FrancoRussian Alliance in 1894 which was then followed by the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Britain The Triple Entente was completed by the 1907 AngloRussian Convention While not formal alliances by settling longstanding colonial disputes in Asia and Africa British support for France or Russia in any future conflict became a possibility This was accentuated by British and Russian support for France against Germany during the 1911 Agadir Crisis Arms race German economic and industrial strength continued to expand rapidly post1871 Backed by Wilhelm II Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz sought to use this growth to build an Imperial German Navy that could compete with the British Royal Navy This policy was based on the work of US naval author Alfred Thayer Mahan who argued that possession of a bluewater navy was vital for global power projection Tirpitz had his books translated into German while Wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel However it was also an emotional decision driven by Wilhelms simultaneous admiration for the Royal Navy and desire to surpass it Bismarck thought that the British would not interfere in Europe as long as its maritime supremacy remained secure but his dismissal in 1890 led to a change in policy and an AngloGerman naval arms race began Despite the vast sums spent by Tirpitz the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 gave the British a technological advantage Ultimately the race diverted huge resources into creating a German navy large enough to antagonise Britain but not defeat it in 1911 Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg acknowledged defeat leading to the Rstungswende or armaments turning point when he switched expenditure from the navy to the army This decision was not driven by a reduction in political tensions but by German concern over Russias quick recovery from its defeat in the RussoJapanese War and subsequent 1905 Russian Revolution Economic reforms led to a significant post1908 expansion of railways and transportation infrastructure particularly in its western border regions Since Germany and AustriaHungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for their numerical inferiority compared to Russia the threat posed by the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the Royal Navy After Germany expanded its standing army by 170000 troops in 1913 France extended compulsory military service from two to three years similar measures were taken by the Balkan powers and Italy which led to increased expenditure by the Ottomans and AustriaHungary Absolute figures are difficult to calculate due to differences in categorising expenditure since they often omit civilian infrastructure projects like railways which had logistical importance and military use It is known however that from 1908 to 1913 military spending by the six major European powers increased by over 50 in real terms Conflicts in the Balkans The years before 1914 were marked by a series of crises in the Balkans as other powers sought to benefit from the Ottoman decline While PanSlavic and Orthodox Russia considered itself the protector of Serbia and other Slav states they preferred the strategically vital Bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak Ottoman government rather than an ambitious Slav power like Bulgaria Russia had ambitions in northeastern Anatolia while its clients had overlapping claims in the Balkans These competing interests divided Russian policymakers and added to regional instability Austrian statesmen viewed the Balkans as essential for the continued existence of their Empire and saw Serbian expansion as a direct threat The 19081909 Bosnian Crisis began when Austria annexed the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina which it had occupied since 1878 Timed to coincide with the Bulgarian Declaration of Independence from the Ottoman Empire this unilateral action was denounced by the European powers but accepted as there was no consensus on how to resolve the situation Some historians see this as a significant escalation ending any chance of Austria cooperating with Russia in the Balkans while also damaging diplomatic relations between Serbia and Italy Tensions increased after the 19111912 ItaloTurkish War demonstrated Ottoman weakness and led to the formation of the Balkan League an alliance of Serbia Bulgaria Montenegro and Greece The League quickly overran most of the Ottomans territory in the Balkans during the 19121913 First Balkan War much to the surprise of outside observers The Serbian capture of ports on the Adriatic resulted in partial Austrian mobilisation starting on 21 November 1912 including units along the Russian border in Galicia The Russian government decided not to mobilise in response unprepared to precipitate a war The Great Powers sought to reassert control through the 1913 Treaty of London which had created an independent Albania while enlarging the territories of Bulgaria Serbia Montenegro and Greece However disputes between the victors sparked the 33day Second Balkan War when Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913 it was defeated losing most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece and Southern Dobruja to Romania The result was that even countries which benefited from the Balkan Wars such as Serbia and Greece felt cheated of their rightful gains while for Austria it demonstrated the apparent indifference with which other powers viewed their concerns including Germany This complex mix of resentment nationalism and insecurity helps explain why the pre1914 Balkans became known as the powder keg of Europe Prelude Sarajevo assassination On 28 June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria visited Sarajevo the capital of the recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina Cvjetko Popovi Gavrilo Princip Nedeljko abrinovi Trifko Grabe Vaso ubrilovi Bosnian Serbs and Muhamed Mehmedbai from the Bosniaks community from the movement known as Young Bosnia took up positions along the Archdukes motorcade route to assassinate him Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian Black Hand intelligence organisation they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian rule abrinovi threw a grenade at the Archdukes car and injured two of his aides The other assassins were also unsuccessful An hour later as Ferdinand was returning from visiting the injured officers in hospital his car took a wrong turn into a street where Gavrilo Princip was standing He fired two pistol shots fatally wounding Ferdinand and his wife Sophie According to historian Zbynk Zeman in Vienna the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever On 28 and 29 June the crowds listened to music and drank wine as if nothing had happened Nevertheless the impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant and has been described by historian Christopher Clark as a 911 effect a terrorist event charged with historic meaning transforming the political chemistry in Vienna Expansion of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina AustroHungarian authorities encouraged subsequent antiSerb riots in Sarajevo Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside Sarajevo in other cities in AustroHungariancontrolled Bosnia and Herzegovina Croatia and Slovenia AustroHungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned approximately 5500 prominent Serbs 700 to 2200 of whom died in prison A further 460 Serbs were sentenced to death A predominantly Bosniak special militia known as the Schutzkorps was established and carried out the persecution of Serbs July Crisis The assassination initiated the July Crisis a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between AustriaHungary Germany Russia France and Britain Believing that Serbian intelligence helped organise Franz Ferdinands murder Austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end their interference in Bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this However the Foreign Ministry had no solid proof of Serbian involvement On 23 July Austria delivered an ultimatum to Serbia listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities Serbia ordered general mobilization on 25 July but accepted all the terms except for those empowering Austrian representatives to suppress subversive elements inside Serbia and take part in the investigation and trial of Serbians linked to the assassination Claiming this amounted to rejection Austria broke off diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilisation the next day on 28 July they declared war on Serbia and began shelling Belgrade Russia ordered general mobilization in support of Serbia on 30 July Anxious to ensure backing from the SPD political opposition by presenting Russia as the aggressor German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg delayed the commencement of war preparations until 31 July That afternoon the Russian government were handed a note requiring them to cease all war measures against Germany and AustriaHungary within 12 hours A further German demand for neutrality was refused by the French who ordered general mobilization but delayed declaring war The German General Staff had long assumed they faced a war on two fronts the Schlieffen Plan envisaged using 80 of the army to defeat France then switching to Russia Since this required them to move quickly mobilization orders were issued that afternoon Once the German ultimatum to Russia expired on the morning of 1 August the two countries were at war At a meeting on 29 July the British cabinet had narrowly decided its obligations to Belgium under the 1839 Treaty of London did not require it to oppose a German invasion with military force however Prime Minister Asquith and his senior Cabinet ministers were already committed to supporting France the Royal Navy had been mobilised and public opinion was strongly in favour of intervention On 31 July Britain sent notes to Germany and France asking them to respect Belgian neutrality France pledged to do so but Germany did not reply Aware of German plans to attack through Belgium French CommanderinChief Joseph Joffre asked his government for permission to cross the border and preempt such a move To avoid violating Belgian neutrality he was told any advance could come only after a German invasion Instead the French cabinet ordered its Army to withdraw 10 km behind the German frontier to avoid provoking war On 2 August Germany occupied Luxembourg and exchanged fire with French units when German patrols entered French territory on 3 August they declared war on France and demanded free passage across Belgium which was refused Early on the morning of 4 August the Germans invaded and Albert I of Belgium called for assistance under the Treaty of London Britain sent Germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from Belgium when this expired at midnight without a response the two empires were at war Progress of the war Opening hostilities Confusion among the Central Powers Germany promised to support AustriaHungarys invasion of Serbia but interpretations of what this meant differed Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914 but those had never been tested in exercises AustroHungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia Serbian campaign Beginning on 12 August the Austrians and Serbs clashed at the battles of the Cer and Kolubara over the next two weeks Austrian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses As a result Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front weakening their efforts against Russia Serbias victory against AustriaHungary in the 1914 invasion has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century In 1915 the campaign saw the first use of antiaircraft warfare after an Austrian plane was shot down with groundtoair fire as well as the first medical evacuation by the Serbian army German offensive in Belgium and France Upon mobilisation in accordance with the Schlieffen Plan 80 of the German Army was located on the Western Front with the remainder acting as a screening force in the East Rather than a direct attack across their shared frontier the German right wing would sweep through the Netherlands and Belgium then swing south encircling Paris and trapping the French army against the Swiss border The plans creator Alfred von Schlieffen head of the German General Staff from 1891 to 1906 estimated that this would take six weeks after which the German army would transfer to the East and defeat the Russians The plan was substantially modified by his successor Helmuth von Moltke the Younger Under Schlieffen 85 of German forces in the west were assigned to the right wing with the remainder holding along the frontier By keeping his leftwing deliberately weak he hoped to lure the French into an offensive into the lost provinces of AlsaceLorraine which was the strategy envisaged by their Plan XVII However Moltke grew concerned that the French might push too hard on his left flank and as the German Army increased in size from 1908 to 1914 he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings to 7030 He also considered Dutch neutrality essential for German trade and cancelled the incursion into the Netherlands which meant any delays in Belgium threatened the viability of the plan Historian Richard Holmes argues that these changes meant the right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success The initial German advance in the West was very successful By the end of August the Allied left which included the British Expeditionary Force BEF was in full retreat and the French offensive in AlsaceLorraine was a disastrous failure with casualties exceeding 260000 German planning provided broad strategic instructions while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front but von Kluck used this freedom to disobey orders opening a gap between the German armies as they closed on Paris The French army reinforced by the British expeditionary corps seized this opportunity to counterattack and pushed the German army 40 to 80 km back Both armies were then so exhausted that no decisive move could be implemented so they settled in trenches with the vain hope of breaking through as soon as they could build local superiority In 1911 the Russian Stavka agreed with the French to attack Germany within fifteen days of mobilisation ten days before the Germans had anticipated although it meant the two Russian armies that entered East Prussia on 17 August did so without many of their support elements By the end of 1914 German troops held strong defensive positions inside France controlled the bulk of Frances domestic coalfields and inflicted 230000 more casualties than it lost itself However communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long twofront war As was apparent to several German leaders this amounted to a strategic defeat shortly after the First Battle of the Marne Crown Prince Wilhelm told an American reporter We have lost the war It will go on for a long time but lost it is already Asia and the Pacific On 30 August 1914 New Zealand occupied German Samoa now Samoa On 11 September the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island of New Britain then part of German New Guinea On 28 October the German cruiser SMS Emden sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug in the Battle of Penang Japan declared war on Germany before seizing territories in the Pacific which later became the South Seas Mandate as well as German Treaty ports on the Chinese Shandong peninsula at Tsingtao After Vienna refused to withdraw its cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth from Tsingtao Japan declared war on AustriaHungary and the ship was sunk in November 1914 Within a few months Allied forces had seized all German territories in the Pacific leaving only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea African campaigns Some of the first clashes of the war involved British French and German colonial forces in Africa On 67 August French and British troops invaded the German protectorates of Togoland and Kamerun On 10 August German forces in SouthWest Africa attacked South Africa sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war The German colonial forces in German East Africa led by Colonel Paul von LettowVorbeck fought a guerrilla warfare campaign and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe Indian support for the Allies Before the war Germany had attempted to use Indian nationalism and panIslamism to its advantage a policy continued post1914 by instigating uprisings in India while the NiedermayerHentig Expedition urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central Powers However contrary to British fears of a revolt in India the outbreak of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity Leaders from the Indian National Congress and other groups believed support for the British war effort would hasten Indian Home Rule a promise allegedly made explicit in 1917 by Edwin Montagu the Secretary of State for India In 1914 the British Indian Army was larger than the British Army itself and between 1914 and 1918 an estimated 13 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe Africa and the Middle East In all 140000 soldiers served on the Western Front and nearly 700000 in the Middle East with 47746 killed and 65126 wounded The suffering engendered by the war as well as the failure of the British government to grant selfgovernment to India afterward bred disillusionment resulting in the campaign for full independence led by Mahatma Gandhi Western Front Trench warfare begins Prewar military tactics that had emphasised open warfare and individual riflemen proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in 1914 Technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances such as barbed wire machine guns and above all far more powerful artillery which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult Both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties In time technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons such as gas warfare and the tank After the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914 Allied and German forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other a series of manoeuvres later known as the Race to the Sea By the end of 1914 the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from the Channel to the Swiss border Since the Germans were normally able to choose where to stand they generally held the high ground while their trenches tended to be better built those constructed by the French and English were initially considered temporary only needed until an offensive would destroy the German defences Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances On 22 April 1915 at the Second Battle of Ypres the Germans violating the Hague Convention used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides and though it never proved a decisive battlewinning weapon it became one of the most feared and bestremembered horrors of the war Continuation of trench warfare In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the Battle of Verdun lasting until December 1916 Casualties were greater for the French but the Germans bled heavily as well with anywhere from 700000 to 975000 casualties between the two combatants Verdun became a symbol of French determination and selfsacrifice The Battle of the Somme was an AngloFrench offensive from July to November 1916 The opening day on 1 July 1916 was the bloodiest single day in the history of the British Army which suffered 57500 casualties including 19200 dead As a whole the Somme offensive led to an estimated 420000 British casualties along with 200000 French and 500000 Germans The diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides The living conditions led to disease and infection such as trench foot lice typhus trench fever and the Spanish flu Naval war At the start of the war German cruisers were scattered across the globe some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping These were systematically hunted down by the Royal Navy though not before causing considerable damage One of the most successful was the SMS Emden part of the German East Asia Squadron stationed at Qingdao which seized or sank 15 merchantmen a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer Most of the squadron was returning to Germany when it sank two British armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel in November 1914 before being virtually destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December The SMS Dresden escaped with a few auxiliaries but after the Battle of Ms a Tierra these too were either destroyed or interned Soon after the outbreak of hostilities Britain began a naval blockade of Germany This proved effective in cutting off vital supplies though it violated accepted international law Britain also mined international waters which closed off entire sections of the ocean even to neutral ships Since there was limited response to this tactic Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare The Battle of Jutland in MayJune 1916 was the only fullscale clash of battleships during the war and one of the largest in history The clash was indecisive though the Germans inflicted more damage than they received thereafter the bulk of the German High Seas Fleet was confined to port German Uboats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival The United States launched a protest and Germany changed its rules of engagement After the sinking of the passenger ship RMS Lusitania in 1915 Germany promised not to target passenger liners while Britain armed its merchant ships placing them beyond the protection of the cruiser rules which demanded warning and movement of crews to a place of safety a standard that lifeboats did not meet Finally in early 1917 Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare realising the Americans would eventually enter the war Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the United States could transport a large army overseas but after initial successes eventually failed to do so The Uboat threat lessened in 1917 when merchant ships began travelling in convoys escorted by destroyers This tactic made it difficult for Uboats to find targets which significantly lessened losses after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced destroyers could potentially successfully attack a submerged submarine Convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled the solution was an extensive program of building new freighters Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys The Uboats sunk more than 5000 Allied ships at the cost of 199 submarines World War I also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a successful raid against the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in July 1918 as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol Southern theatres War in the Balkans Faced with Russia in the east AustriaHungary could spare only onethird of its army to attack Serbia After suffering heavy losses the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital Belgrade A Serbian counterattack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914 For the first 10 months of 1915 AustriaHungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy German and AustroHungarian diplomats scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia The AustroHungarian provinces of Slovenia Croatia and Bosnia provided troops for AustriaHungary Montenegro allied itself with Serbia Bulgaria declared war on Serbia on 14 October 1915 and joined in the attack by the AustroHungarian army under Mackensens army of 250000 that was already underway Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month as the Central Powers now including Bulgaria sent in 600000 troops in total The Serbian army fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat retreated into northern Albania The Serbs suffered defeat in the Battle of Kosovo Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat toward the Adriatic coast in the Battle of Mojkovac on 67 January 1916 but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro The surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated to Greece After the conquest Serbia was divided between AustroHungary and Bulgaria In late 1915 a FrancoBritish force landed at Salonica in Greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the Central Powers However the proGerman King Constantine I dismissed the proAllied government of Eleftherios Venizelos before the Allied expeditionary force arrived The Macedonian front was at first mostly static French and Serbian forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing Bitola on 19 November 1916 following the costly Monastir offensive which brought stabilisation of the front Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough in September 1918 in the Vardar offensive after most German and AustroHungarian troops had been withdrawn The Bulgarians were defeated at the Battle of Dobro Pole and by 25 September British and French troops had crossed the border into Bulgaria proper as the Bulgarian army collapsed Bulgaria capitulated four days later on 29 September 1918 The German high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line but these forces were too weak to reestablish a front The disappearance of the Macedonian front meant that the road to Budapest and Vienna was now opened to Allied forces Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and a day after the Bulgarian collapse insisted on an immediate peace settlement Ottoman Empire The Ottomans threatened Russias Caucasian territories and Britains communications with India via the Suez Canal The Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers preoccupation with the war and conducted largescale ethnic cleansing of the Armenian Greek and Assyrian Christian populationsthe Armenian genocide Greek genocide and Sayfo respectively The British and French opened overseas fronts with the Gallipoli 1915 and Mesopotamian campaigns 1914 In Gallipoli the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British French and Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ANZACs In Mesopotamia by contrast after the defeat of the British defenders in the siege of Kut by the Ottomans 19151916 British Imperial forces reorganised and captured Baghdad in March 1917 The British were aided in Mesopotamia by local Arab and Assyrian fighters while the Ottomans employed local Kurdish and Turcoman tribes The Suez Canal was defended from Ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916 in August 1916 a German and Ottoman force was defeated at the Battle of Romani by the ANZAC Mounted Division and the 52nd Lowland Infantry Division Following this victory an Egyptian Expeditionary Force advanced across the Sinai Peninsula pushing Ottoman forces back in the Battle of Magdhaba in December and the Battle of Rafa on the border between the Egyptian Sinai and Ottoman Palestine in January 1917 Russian armies generally had success in the Caucasus campaign Enver Pasha supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces dreamed of reconquering central Asia and areas that had been previously lost to Russia He was however a poor commander He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100000 troops insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter He lost 86 of his force at the Battle of Sarikamish General Yudenich the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916 drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus The Ottoman Empire with German support invaded Persia modern Iran in December 1914 to cut off British and Russian access to petroleum reservoirs around Baku Persia ostensibly neutral had long been under British and Russian influence The Ottomans and Germans were aided by Kurdish and Azeri forces together with a large number of major Iranian tribes while the Russians and British had the support of Armenian and Assyrian forces The Persian campaign lasted until 1918 and ended in failure for the Ottomans and their allies However the Russian withdrawal from the war in 1917 led Armenian and Assyrian forces to be cut off from supply lines outnumbered outgunned and isolated forcing them to fight and flee towards British lines in northern Mesopotamia The Arab Revolt instigated by the British Foreign Office started in June 1916 with the Battle of Mecca led by Sharif Hussein The Sharif declared the independence of the Kingdom of Hejaz and with British assistance conquered much of Ottomanheld Arabia resulting finally in the Ottoman surrender of Damascus Fakhri Pasha the Ottoman commander of Medina resisted for more than 212 years during the siege of Medina before surrendering in January 1919 The Senussi tribe along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt incited and armed by the Turks waged a smallscale guerrilla war against Allied troops The British were forced to dispatch 12000 troops to oppose them in the Senussi campaign Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid1916 Total Allied casualties on the Ottoman fronts amounted to 650000 men Total Ottoman casualties were 725000 with 325000 dead and 400000 wounded Italian Front Though Italy joined the Triple Alliance in 1882 a treaty with its traditional Austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in 1915 This arose from nationalist designs on AustroHungarian territory in Trentino the Austrian Littoral Rijeka and Dalmatia considered vital to secure the borders established in 1866 In 1902 Rome secretly had agreed with France to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by Germany effectively nullifying its role in the Triple Alliance When the war began in 1914 Italy argued the Triple Alliance was defensive and it was not obliged to support an Austrian attack on Serbia Opposition to joining the Central Powers increased when Turkey became a member in September since in 1911 Italy had occupied Ottoman possessions in Libya and the Dodecanese islands To secure Italian neutrality the Central Powers offered them Tunisia while in return for an immediate entry into the war the Allies agreed to their demands for Austrian territory and sovereignty over the Dodecanese Although they remained secret these provisions were incorporated into the April 1915 Treaty of London Italy joined the Triple Entente and on 23 May declared war on AustriaHungary followed by Germany fifteen months later The pre1914 Italian army was short of officers trained men adequate transport and modern weapons by April 1915 some of these deficiencies had been remedied but it was still unprepared for the major offensive required by the Treaty of London The advantage of superior numbers was offset by the difficult terrain much of the fighting took place high in the Alps and Dolomites where trench lines had to be cut through rock and ice and keeping troops supplied was a major challenge These issues were exacerbated by unimaginative strategies and tactics Between 1915 and 1917 the Italian commander Luigi Cadorna undertook a series of frontal assaults along the Isonzo which made little progress and cost many lives by the end of the war Italian combat deaths totalled around 548000 In the spring of 1916 the AustroHungarians counterattacked in Asiago in the Strafexpedition but made little progress and were pushed by the Italians back to Tyrol Although Italy occupied southern Albania in May 1916 their main focus was the Isonzo front which after the capture of Gorizia in August 1916 remained static until October 1917 After a combined AustroGerman force won a major victory at Caporetto Cadorna was replaced by Armando Diaz who retreated more than 100 kilometres 62 mi before holding positions along the Piave River A second Austrian offensive was repulsed in June 1918 On 24 October Diaz launched the Battle of Vittorio Veneto and initially met stubborn resistance but with AustriaHungary collapsing Hungarian divisions in Italy demanded they be sent home When this was granted many others followed and the Imperial army disintegrated the Italians taking over 300000 prisoners On 3 November the Armistice of Villa Giusti ended hostilities between AustriaHungary and Italy which occupied Trieste and areas along the Adriatic Sea awarded to it in 1915 Eastern Front Initial actions As previously agreed with French president Raymond Poincar Russian plans at the start of the war were to simultaneously advance into Austrian Galicia and East Prussia as soon as possible Although their attack on Galicia was largely successful and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing Germany to divert troops from the Western Front the speed of mobilisation meant they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support functions These weaknesses contributed to Russian defeats at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August and September 1914 forcing them to withdraw from East Prussia with heavy losses By spring 1915 they had also retreated from Galicia and the May 1915 GorliceTarnw offensive allowed the Central Powers to invade Russianoccupied Poland Despite the successful June 1916 Brusilov offensive against the Austrians in eastern Galicia shortages of supplies heavy losses and command failures prevented the Russians from fully exploiting their victory However it was one of the most significant offensives of the war diverting German resources from Verdun relieving AustroHungarian pressure on the Italians and convincing Romania to enter the war on the side of the Allies on 27 August It also fatally weakened both the Austrian and Russian armies whose offensive capabilities were badly affected by their losses and increased disillusion with the war that ultimately led to the Russian revolutions Meanwhile unrest grew in Russia as the Tsar remained at the front with the home front controlled by Empress Alexandra Her increasingly incompetent rule and food shortages in urban areas led to widespread protests and the murder of her favourite Grigori Rasputin at the end of 1916 Romanian participation Despite secretly agreeing to support the Triple Alliance in 1883 Romania increasingly found itself at odds with the Central Powers over their support for Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and the status of ethnic Romanian communities in Hungariancontrolled Transylvania which comprised an estimated 28 million of the 50 million population With the ruling elite split into proGerman and proEntente factions Romania remained neutral for two years while allowing Germany and Austria to transport military supplies and advisors across Romanian territory In September 1914 Russia acknowledged Romanian rights to AustroHungarian territories including Transylvania and Banat whose acquisition had widespread popular support and Russian success against Austria led Romania to join the Entente in the August 1916 Treaty of Bucharest Under the strategic plan known as Hypothesis Z the Romanian army planned an offensive into Transylvania while defending Southern Dobruja and Giurgiu against a possible Bulgarian counterattack On 27 August 1916 they attacked Transylvania and occupied substantial parts of the province before being driven back by the recently formed German 9th Army led by former Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn A combined GermanBulgarianTurkish offensive captured Dobruja and Giurgiu although the bulk of the Romanian army managed to escape encirclement and retreated to Bucharest which surrendered to the Central Powers on 6 December 1916 In the summer of 1917 a Central Powers offensive began in Romania under the command of August von Mackensen to knock Romania out of the war resulting in the battles of Oituz Mrti and Mreti where up to 1000000 Central Powers troops were present The battles lasted from 22 July to 3 September and eventually the Romanian army was victorious advancing 500 km2 August von Mackensen could not plan for another offensive as he had to transfer troops to the Italian Front Following the Russian revolution Romania found itself alone on the Eastern Front and signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers which recognised Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the Carpathian Mountains to AustriaHungary and leasing its oil wells to Germany Although approved by Parliament King Ferdinand I refused to sign it hoping for an Allied victory in the west Romania reentered the war on 10 November 1918 on the side of the Allies and the Treaty of Bucharest was formally annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918 Central Powers peace overtures On 12 December 1916 after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun and a successful offensive against Romania Germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies However this attempt was rejected out of hand as a duplicitous war ruse US president Woodrow Wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker asking for both sides to state their demands Lloyd Georges War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions among the Allies After initial outrage and much deliberation they took Wilsons note as a separate effort signalling that the US was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the submarine outrages While the Allies debated a response to Wilsons offer the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of a direct exchange of views Learning of the German response the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January They sought restoration of damages the evacuation of occupied territories reparations for France Russia and Romania and a recognition of the principle of nationalities The Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds of honour and noted Germany had not put forward any specific proposals Final years of the war Russian Revolution and withdrawal By the end of 1916 Russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed wounded or captured with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices In March 1917 Tsar Nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress strikes in Petrograd but the troops refused to fire on the crowds Revolutionaries set up the Petrograd Soviet and fearing a leftwing takeover the State Duma forced Nicholas to abdicate and established the Russian Provisional Government which confirmed Russias willingness to continue the war However the Petrograd Soviet refused to disband creating competing power centres and causing confusion and chaos with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised Following the Tsars abdication Vladimir Leninwith the help of the German governmentwas ushered from Switzerland into Russia on 16 April 1917 Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party led by Lenin which demanded an immediate end to the war The Revolution of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany At first the Bolsheviks refused the German terms but when German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed they acceded to the Treaty of BrestLitovsk on 3 March 1918 The treaty ceded vast territories including Finland Estonia Latvia Lithuania and parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers With the Russian Empire out of the war Romania found itself alone on the Eastern Front and signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers in May 1918 Under the terms of the treaty Romania ceded territory to AustriaHungary and Bulgaria and leased its oil reserves to Germany However the terms also included the Central Powers recognition of the union of Bessarabia with Romania United States enters the war The United States was a major supplier of war material to the Allies but remained neutral in 1914 in large part due to domestic opposition The most significant factor in creating the support Wilson needed was the German submarine offensive which not only cost American lives but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to sea On 6 April 1917 Congress declared war on Germany as an Associated Power of the Allies The US Navy sent a battleship group to Scapa Flow to join the Grand Fleet and provided convoy escorts In April 1917 the US Army had fewer than 300000 men including National Guard units compared to British and French armies of 41 and 83 million respectively The Selective Service Act of 1917 drafted 28 million men though training and equipping such numbers was a huge logistical challenge By June 1918 over 667000 members of the American Expeditionary Forces AEF were transported to France a figure which reached 2 million by the end of November Despite his conviction that Germany must be defeated Wilson went to war to ensure the US played a leading role in shaping the peace which meant preserving the AEF as a separate military force rather than being absorbed into British or French units as his Allies wanted He was strongly supported by AEF commander General John J Pershing a proponent of pre1914 open warfare who considered the French and British emphasis on artillery misguided and incompatible with American offensive spirit Much to the frustration of his Allies who had suffered heavy losses in 1917 he insisted on retaining control of American troops and refused to commit them to the front line until able to operate as independent units As a result the first significant US involvement was the MeuseArgonne offensive in late September 1918 Nivelle Offensive AprilMay 1917 In December 1916 Robert Nivelle replaced Ptain as commander of French armies on the Western Front and began planning a spring attack in Champagne part of a joint FrancoBritish operation Poor security meant German intelligence was well informed on tactics and timetables but despite this when the attack began on 16 April the French made substantial gains before being brought to a halt by the newly built and extremely strong defences of the Hindenburg Line Nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and by 25 April the French had suffered nearly 135000 casualties including 30000 dead most incurred in the first two days Concurrent British attacks at Arras were more successful though ultimately of little strategic value Operating as a separate unit for the first time the Canadian Corps capture of Vimy Ridge is viewed by many Canadians as a defining moment in creating a sense of national identity Though Nivelle continued the offensive on 3 May the 21st Division which had been involved in some of the heaviest fighting at Verdun refused orders to go into battle initiating the French Army mutinies within days collective indiscipline had spread to 54 divisions while over 20000 deserted Sinai and Palestine campaign 19171918 In March and April 1917 at the First and Second Battles of Gaza German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force which had begun in August 1916 at the Battle of Romani At the end of October 1917 the Sinai and Palestine campaign resumed when General Edmund Allenbys XXth Corps XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps won the Battle of Beersheba Two Ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the Battle of Mughar Ridge and early in December Jerusalem had been captured following another Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Jerusalem About this time Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the Eighth Armys commander replaced by Djevad Pasha and a few months later the commander of the Ottoman Army in Palestine Erich von Falkenhayn was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders In early 1918 the front line was extended and the Jordan Valley was occupied following the First Transjordan and the Second Transjordan attacks by British Empire forces in March and April 1918 German offensive and Allied counteroffensive MarchNovember 1918 In December 1917 the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the West With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war but they held high hopes for success in a final quick offensive Ludendorff drew up plans Operation Michael for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near SaintQuentin German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres 37 mi The initial offensive was a success after heavy fighting however the offensive was halted Lacking tanks or motorised artillery the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains The problems of resupply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shelltorn and often impassable to traffic Germany launched Operation Georgette against the northern English Channel ports The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany The German Army to the south then conducted Operations Blcher and Yorck pushing broadly towards Paris Germany launched Operation Marne Second Battle of the Marne on 15 July in an attempt to encircle Reims The resulting counterattack which started the Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August led to a marked collapse in German morale Allied advance to the Hindenburg Line By September the Germans had fallen back to the Hindenburg Line The Allies had advanced to the Hindenburg Line in the north and centre German forces launched numerous counterattacks but positions and outposts of the Line continued falling with the BEF alone taking 30441 prisoners in the last week of September On 24 September the Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable The final assault on the Hindenburg Line began with the MeuseArgonne offensive launched by American and French troops on 26 September Two days later the Belgians French and British attacked around Ypres and the day after the British at St Quentin in the centre of the line The following week cooperating American and French units broke through in Champagne at the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge 327 October forcing the Germans off the commanding heights and closing towards the Belgian frontier On 8 October the Hindenburg Line was pierced by British and Dominion troops of the First and Third British Armies at the Second Battle of Cambrai Breakthrough of Macedonian front September 1918 Allied forces started the Vardar offensive on 15 September at two key points Dobro Pole and near Dojran Lake In the Battle of Dobro Pole the Serbian and French armies had success after a threedaylong battle with relatively small casualties and subsequently made a breakthrough in the front something which was rarely seen in World War I After the front was broken Allied forces started to liberate Serbia and reached Skopje at 29 September after which Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 30 September Armistices and capitulations The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September 1918 German Emperor Wilhelm II in a telegram to Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I described the situation thus Disgraceful 62000 Serbs decided the war On the same day the German Supreme Army Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor Count Georg von Hertling that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless On 24 October the Italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto marking the end of the AustroHungarian Army as an effective fighting force The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the AustroHungarian Empire During the last week of October declarations of independence were made in Budapest Prague and Zagreb On 29 October the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice but the Italians continued advancing reaching Trento Udine and Trieste On 3 November AustriaHungary sent a flag of truce and accepted the Armistice of Villa Giusti arranged with the Allied Authorities in Paris Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the Habsburg monarchy In the following days the Italian Army occupied Innsbruck and all Tyrol with over 20000 soldiers On 30 October the Ottoman Empire capitulated and signed the Armistice of Mudros German government surrenders With the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country Germany moved towards surrender Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge on October 3 as Chancellor of Germany Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the German military The German Revolution of 19181919 began at the end of October 1918 Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last largescale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost The sailors revolt which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II and German surrender Aftermath In the aftermath of the war the German AustroHungarian Ottoman and Russian empires disappeared Numerous nations regained their former independence and new ones were created Four dynasties fell as a result of the war the Romanovs the Hohenzollerns the Habsburgs and the Ottomans Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged as was France with 14 million soldiers dead not counting other casualties Germany and Russia were similarly affected Formal end of the war A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919 The US Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the KnoxPorter Resolution was signed on 2 July 1921 by President Warren G Harding For the British Empire the state of war ceased under the provisions of the Termination of the Present War Definition Act 1918 concerning Germany on 10 January 1920 Austria on 16 July 1920 Bulgaria on 9 August 1920 Hungary on 26 July 1921 Turkey on 6 August 1924 Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919 which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home by contrast most commemorations of the wars end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918 Peace treaties and national boundaries The Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war The 1919 Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany and building on Wilsons 14th point established the League of Nations on 28 June 1919 The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by their aggression In the Treaty of Versailles this statement was Article 231 This article became known as the War Guilt Clause as the majority of Germans felt humiliated and resentful The Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the diktat of Versailles German historian Hagen Schulze said the Treaty placed Germany under legal sanctions deprived of military power economically ruined and politically humiliated Belgian historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the 1920s and 1930s Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic The legend of the stab in the back and the wish to revise the Versailles diktat and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at the heart of German politics Even a man of peace such as Gustav Stresemann publicly rejected German guilt As for the Nazis they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the German nation into a spirit of revenge Like a Fascist Italy Nazi Germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its policies Meanwhile new nations liberated from German rule viewed the treaty as a recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighboursAustriaHungary was partitioned into several successor states largely but not entirely along ethnic lines Apart from Austria and Hungary Czechoslovakia Italy Poland Romania and Yugoslavia received territories from the Dual Monarchy the formerly separate and autonomous Kingdom of CroatiaSlavonia was incorporated into Yugoslavia The details were contained in the treaties of SaintGermainenLaye and Trianon As a result Hungary lost 64 of its total population decreasing from 209 million to 76 million and losing 31 33 out of 107 million of its ethnic Hungarians According to the 1910 census speakers of the Hungarian language included approximately 54 of the entire population of the Kingdom of Hungary Within the country numerous ethnic minorities were present 161 Romanians 105 Slovaks 104 Germans 25 Ruthenians 25 Serbs and 8 others Between 1920 and 1924 354000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia The Russian Empire lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of Estonia Finland Latvia Lithuania and Poland were carved from it Romania took control of Bessarabia in April 1918 National identities After 123 years Poland reemerged as an independent country The Kingdom of Serbia and its dynasty as a minor Entente nation and the country with the most casualties per capita became the backbone of a new multinational state the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes later renamed Yugoslavia Czechoslovakia combining the Kingdom of Bohemia with parts of the Kingdom of Hungary became a new nation Romania would unite all Romanianspeaking people under a single state leading to Greater Romania In Australia and New Zealand the Battle of Gallipoli became known as those nations Baptism of Fire It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians not just subjects of the British Crown and independent national identities for these nations took hold Anzac Day commemorating the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ANZAC celebrates this defining moment In the aftermath of World War I Greece fought against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty of Lausanne According to various sources several hundred thousand Greeks died during this period which was tied in with the Greek genocide Casualties The total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I was about 40 million estimates range from around 15 to 22 million deaths and about 23 million wounded military personnel ranking it among the deadliest conflicts in human history The total number of deaths includes between 9 and 11 million military personnel with an estimated civilian death toll of about 6 to 13 million Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918 an estimated 8 million were killed 7 million were permanently disabled and 15 million were seriously injured Germany lost 151 of its active male population AustriaHungary lost 171 and France lost 105 France mobilised 78 million men of which 14 million died and 32 million were injured Approximately 15000 deployed men sustained gruesome facial injuries causing social stigma and marginalisation they were called the gueules casses broken faces In Germany civilian deaths were 474000 higher than in peacetime due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that had weakened disease resistance These excess deaths are estimated as 271000 in 1918 plus another 71000 in the first half of 1919 when the blockade was still in effect Starvation caused by famine killed approximately 100000 people in Lebanon Diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions In 1914 alone louseborne epidemic typhus killed 200000 in Serbia Starting in early 1918 a major influenza epidemic known as Spanish flu spread across the world accelerated by the movement of large numbers of soldiers often crammed together in camps and transport ships with poor sanitation The Spanish flu killed at least 17 to 25 million people including an estimated 264 million Europeans and as many as 675000 Americans Between 1915 and 1926 an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica affected nearly 5 million people worldwide Eight million equines mostly horses donkeys and mules died threequarters of them from the extreme conditions they worked in War crimes Chemical weapons in warfare The German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the Second Battle of Ypres AprilMay 1915 after German scientists under the direction of Fritz Haber at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute developed a method to weaponize chlorine The use of chemical weapons had been sanctioned by the German High Command to force Allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons Chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war inflicting approximately 13 million casualties of which about 90000 were fatal The use of chemical weapons in warfare was a direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare which prohibited their use Genocides by the Ottoman Empire The ethnic cleansing of the Ottoman Empires Armenian population including mass deportations and executions during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered genocide The Ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the Armenian population at the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of Armenian resistance by portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination In early 1915 several Armenians volunteered to join the Russian forces and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the Tehcir Law Law on Deportation which authorised the deportation of Armenians from the Empires eastern provinces to Syria between 1915 and 1918 The Armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by Ottoman brigands While the exact number of deaths is unknown the International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates around 15 million The government of Turkey continues to deny the genocide to the present day arguing that those who died were victims of interethnic fighting famine or disease during World War I these claims are rejected by most historians Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period including Assyrians and Greeks and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination At least 250000 Assyrian Christians about half of the population and 350000750000 Anatolian and Pontic Greeks were killed between 1915 and 1922 Prisoners of war About 8 million soldiers surrendered and were held in POW camps during the war All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front Around 2531 of Russian losses as a proportion of those captured wounded or killed were to prisoner status for AustriaHungary 32 for Italy 26 for France 12 for Germany 9 for Britain 7 Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 14 million not including Russia which lost 2535 million soldiers as prisoners From the Central Powers about 33 million soldiers became prisoners most of them surrendered to Russians Soldiers experiences Allied personnel was around 42928000 while Central personnel was near 25248000 British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but were increasingly conscripted Surviving veterans returning home often found they could discuss their experiences only among themselves so formed veterans associations or Legions Conscription Conscription was common in most European countries However it was controversial in Englishspeaking countries It was especially unpopular among minority ethnicitiesespecially the Irish Catholics in Ireland Australia and the French Catholics in Canada In the US conscription began in 1917 and was generally wellreceived with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription rather than voluntary enlistment to raise military manpower after only 73000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of war Military attachs and war correspondents Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern embedded positions within the opposing land and naval forces Economic effects Macro and microeconomic consequences devolved from the war Families were altered by the departure of many men With the death or absence of the primary wage earner women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers At the same time the industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war This aided the struggle for voting rights for women In all nations the governments share of GDP increased surpassing 50 in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain To pay for purchases in the US Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from Wall Street President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916 but allowed a great increase in US government lending to the Allies After 1919 the US demanded repayment of these loans The repayments were in part funded by German reparations that in turn were supported by American loans to Germany This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid Britain still owed the United States 44 billion of World War I debt in 1934 the last installment was finally paid in 2015 Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult Geologists such as Albert Kitson were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies Kitson discovered important new deposits of manganese used in munitions production in the Gold Coast Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles the socalled war guilt clause stated Germany accepted responsibility for all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary However neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt In 1921 the total reparation sum was placed at 132 billion gold marks However Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay this sum The total sum was divided into three categories with the third being deliberately designed to be chimerical and its primary function was to mislead public opinion into believing the total sum was being maintained Thus 50 billion gold marks 125 billion dollars represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay and therefore represented the total German reparations figure that had to be paid This figure could be paid in cash or inkind coal timber chemical dyes etc Some of the territory lostvia the Treaty of Versailleswas credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the Library of Louvain By 1929 the Great Depression caused political chaos throughout the world In 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community by which point Germany had paid only the equivalent of 20598 billion gold marks With the rise of Adolf Hitler all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled David Andelman notes Refusing to pay doesnt make an agreement null and void The bonds the agreement still exist Thus following the Second World War at the London Conference in 1953 Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed On 3 October 2010 Germany made the final payment on these bonds The Australian prime minister Billy Hughes wrote to the British prime minister David Lloyd George You have assured us that you cannot get better terms I much regret it and hope even now that some way may be found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the British Empire and her Allies Australia received 5571720 in war reparations but the direct cost of the war to Australia had been 376993052 and by the mid1930s repatriation pensions war gratuities interest and sinking fund charges were 831280947 Support and opposition for the war Support In the Balkans Yugoslav nationalists such as the leader Ante Trumbi strongly supported the war desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from AustriaHungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent Yugoslavia The Yugoslav Committee led by Trumbi was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London In April 1918 the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met including Czechoslovak Italian Polish Transylvanian and Yugoslav representatives who urged the Allies to support national selfdetermination for the peoples residing within AustriaHungary In the Middle East Arab nationalism soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a panArab state In 1916 the Arab Revolt began in Ottomancontrolled territories of the Middle East to achieve independence In East Africa Iyasu V of Ethiopia was supporting the Dervish state who were at war with the British in the Somaliland campaign Von Syburg the German envoy in Addis Ababa said now the time has come for Ethiopia to regain the coast of the Red Sea driving the Italians home to restore the Empire to its ancient size The Ethiopian Empire was on the verge of entering World War I on the side of the Central Powers before Iyasus overthrow at the Battle of Segale due to Allied pressure on the Ethiopian aristocracy Several socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914 But European socialists split on national lines with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as Marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support for the war Once the war began Austrian British French German and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries intervention in the war Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele DAnnunzio who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war The Italian Liberal Party under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it some were militant supporters of the war including Benito Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati However the Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after antimilitarist protestors were killed resulting in a general strike called Red Week The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of prowar nationalist members including Mussolini Mussolini formed the prointerventionist Il Popolo dItalia and the Fasci Rivoluzionario dAzione Internazionalista Revolutionary Fasci for International Action in October 1914 that later developed into the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento in 1919 the origin of fascism Mussolinis nationalism enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo an armaments firm and other companies to create Il Popolo dItalia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war Patriotic funds On both sides there was largescale fundraising for soldiers welfare their dependents and those injured The Nail Men were a German example Around the British Empire there were many patriotic funds including the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation Canadian Patriotic Fund Queensland Patriotic Fund and by 1919 there were 983 funds in New Zealand At the start of the next world war the New Zealand funds were reformed having been criticised as overlapping wasteful and abused but 11 were still functioning in 2002 Opposition Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict These included Eugene Debs in the US and Bertrand Russell in Britain In the US the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918 made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed disloyal Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic Several nationalists opposed intervention particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to Although the vast majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915 a minority of advanced Irish nationalists had staunchly opposed taking part The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912 and by July 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916 with Germany sending 20000 rifles to Ireland to stir unrest in Britain The British government placed Ireland under martial law in response to the Easter Rising though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling However opposition to involvement in the war increased in Ireland resulting in the Conscription Crisis of 1918 Other opposition came from conscientious objectorssome socialist some religiouswho had refused to fight In Britain 16000 people asked for conscientious objector status Some of them most notably prominent peace activist Stephen Hobhouse refused both military and alternative service Many suffered years of prison including solitary confinement Even after the war in Britain many job advertisements were marked No conscientious objectors need to apply On 14 May 1917 about 100000 workers and soldiers of Petrograd and after them the workers and soldiers of other Russian cities led by the Bolsheviks demonstrated under banners reading Down with the war and all power to the Soviets The mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the Russian Provisional Government In Milan in May 1917 Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation The Italian army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists who fought violently until May 23 when the army gained control of the city Almost 50 people including three Italian soldiers were killed and over 800 people were arrested Technology World War I began as a clash of 20thcentury technology and 19thcentury tactics with the inevitably large ensuing casualties By the end of 1917 however the major armies had modernised and were making use of telephone wireless communication armoured cars tanks especially with the advent of the prototype tank Little Willie and aircraft Artillery also underwent a revolution In 1914 cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets By 1917 indirect fire with guns as well as mortars and even machine guns was commonplace using new techniques for spotting and ranging notably aircraft and the field telephone Fixedwing aircraft were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack To shoot down enemy planes antiaircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed Strategic bombers were created principally by the Germans and British though the former used Zeppelins as well Towards the end of the conflict aircraft carriers were used for the first time with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at Tnder in 1918 Diplomacy The nonmilitary diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy For the most part wartime diplomacy focused on five issues propaganda campaigns defining and redefining the war goals which became harsher as the war went on luring neutral nations Italy Ottoman Empire Bulgaria Romania into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers especially among Czechs Poles and Arabs In addition multiple peace proposals were coming from neutrals or one side or the other none of them progressed very far Legacy and memory Memorials Memorials were built in thousands of villages and towns Close to battlefields those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission the American Battle Monuments Commission the German War Graves Commission and Le Souvenir franais Many of these graveyards also have monuments to the missing or unidentified dead such as the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme In 1915 John McCrae a Canadian army doctor wrote the poem In Flanders Fields as a salute to those who perished in the war It is still recited today especially on Remembrance Day and Memorial Day National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City Missouri is a memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I The Liberty Memorial was dedicated on 1 November 1921 The British government budgeted substantial resources to the commemoration of the war during the period 2014 to 2018 The lead body is the Imperial War Museum On 3 August 2014 French President Franois Hollande and German President Joachim Gauck together marked the centenary of Germanys declaration of war on France by laying the first stone of a memorial in Vieil Armand known in German as Hartmannswillerkopf for French and German soldiers killed in the war As part of commemorations for the centenary of the 1918 Armistice French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the site of the signing of the Armistice of Compigne and unveiled a plaque to reconciliation Historiography The first efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war and are still underway more than a century later Teaching World War I has presented special challenges When compared with World War II the First World War is often thought to be a wrong war fought for the wrong reasons it lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that characterizes retellings of the Second World War Lacking recognizable heroes and villains it is often taught thematically invoking simplified tropes that obscure the complexity of the conflict Historian Heather Jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by a cultural turn in the 21st century Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation radicalisation of politics race medical science gender and mental health Among the major subjects that historians have long debated regarding the war include Why the war began why the Allies won whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates how soldiers endured the poor conditions of trench warfare and to what extent the civilian home front accepted and endorsed the war effort Unexploded ordnance As late as 2007 unexploded ordnance at battlefield sites like Verdun and Somme continued to pose a danger In France and Belgium locals who discover caches of unexploded munitions are assisted by weapons disposal units In some places plant life has still not recovered from the effects of the war See also Lists of World War I topics List of military engagements of World War I Outline of World War I

    title: "Space race",
    originalContent:
      "The Space Race Russian romanized Kosmicheskaya gonka ksmitskj onk was a 20thcentury competition between the Cold War rivals the United States and the Soviet Union to achieve superior spaceflight capability It had its origins in the ballistic missilebased nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II and had its peak with the more particular Moon Race to land a man on the Moon between the US moonshot and Soviet moonshot programs The technological advantage demonstrated by spaceflight achievement was seen as necessary for national security particularly in regard to intercontinental ballistic missile and satellite reconnaissance capability but also became part of the cultural symbolism and ideology of the time The Space Race brought pioneering launches of artificial satellites robotic landers to the Moon Venus and Mars and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon Public interest in space travel originated in the 1951 publication of a Soviet youth magazine and was promptly picked up by US magazines The competition began on July 30 1955 when the United States announced its intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year Four days later the Soviet Union responded by declaring they would also launch a satellite in the near future The launching of satellites was enabled by developments in ballistic missile capabilities since the end of World War II The competition gained Western public attention with the Sputnik crisis when the USSR achieved the first successful satellite launch Sputnik 1 on October 4 1957 It gained momentum when the USSR sent the first human Yuri Gagarin into space with the orbital flight of Vostok 1 on April 12 1961 These were followed by a string of other firsts achieved by the Soviets over the next few years Gagarins flight led US president John F Kennedy to raise the stakes on May 25 1961 by asking the US Congress to commit to the goal of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth before the end of the decade Both countries began developing super heavylift launch vehicles with the US successfully deploying the Saturn V which was large enough to send a threeperson orbiter and twoperson lander to the Moon Kennedys Moon landing goal was achieved in July 1969 with the flight of Apollo 11 The USSR continued to pursue crewed lunar programs to launch and land on the Moon before the US with its N1 rocket but did not succeed and eventually canceled it to concentrate on Salyut the first space station program and the first landings on Venus and on Mars Meanwhile the US landed five more Apollo crews on the Moon and continued exploration of other extraterrestrial bodies robotically A period of dtente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a cooperative ApolloSoyuz Test Project ASTP resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and joint development of an international docking standard APAS75 Being considered as the final act of the Space Race by many observers the competition was however only gradually replaced with cooperation The collapse of the Soviet Union eventually allowed the US and the newly founded Russian Federation to end their Cold War competition also in space by agreeing in 1993 on the ShuttleMir and International Space Station programs Origins Although Germans Americans and Soviets experimented with small liquidfuel rockets before World War II launching satellites and humans into space required the development of larger ballistic missiles such as Wernher von Brauns Aggregat4 A4 which became known as the Vergeltungswaffe 2 V2 developed by Nazi Germany to bomb the Allies in the war After the war both the US and USSR acquired custody of German rocket development assets which they used to leverage the development of their own missiles Public interest in space flight was first aroused in October 1951 when the Soviet rocketry engineer Mikhail Tikhonravov published Flight to the Moon in the newspaper Pionerskaya pravda for young readers He described a twoperson interplanetary spaceship of the future and the industrial and technological processes required to create it He ended the short article with a clear forecast of the future We do not have long to wait We can assume that the bold dream of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky will be realized within the next 10 to 15 years From March 1952 to April 1954 the US Colliers magazine reacted with a series of seven articles Man Will Conquer Space Soon detailing Wernher von Brauns plans for crewed spaceflight In March 1955 Disneylands animated episode Man in Space which was broadcast on US television with an audience of about 40 million people eventually fired the public enthusiasm for space travel and raised government interest both in the US and USSR Missile race Soon after the end of World War II the two former allies became engaged in a state of political conflict and military tension known as the Cold War 19471991 which polarized Europe between the Soviet Unions satellite states often referred to as the Eastern Bloc and the states of the Western world allied with the US In August 1949 the Soviet Union became the second nuclear power after the United States with the successful RDS1 nuclear weapon test In October 1957 the Soviet Union conducted the worlds first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM this was the R7 Semyorka also known as SS6 by NATO and was seen as capable of striking US territory with a nuclear payload Fears in the US due to this perceived threat became known as the Missile gap The first American ICBM the Atlas missile was tested in late 1958 ICBMs presented the ability to strike targets on the other side of the globe in a very short amount of time and in a manner which was impervious to air interception such as bombers might have been The value which ICBMs presented in a nuclear standoff were very substantial and this fact greatly accelerated efforts to develop rocket and rocket interception technology Soviet rocket development The first Soviet development of artillery rockets was in 1921 when the Soviet military sanctioned the Gas Dynamics Laboratory a small research laboratory to explore solidfuel rockets led by Nikolai Tikhomirov who had begun studying solid and liquidfueled rockets in 1894 and obtained a patent in 1915 for selfpropelled aerial and watersurface mines The first testfiring of a solid fuel rocket was carried out in 1928 Further development was carried out in the 1930s by the Group for the Study of Reactive Motion GIRD where Soviet rocket pioneers Sergey Korolev Friedrich Zander Mikhail Tikhonravov and Leonid Dushkin launched GIRDX the first Soviet liquidfueled rocket in 1933 In 1933 the two design bureaus were combined into the Reactive Scientific Research Institute and produced the RP318 the USSRs first rocketpowered aircraft and the RS82 and RS132 missiles which became the basis for the Katyusha multiple rocket launcher During the 1930s Soviet rocket technology was comparable to Germanys but Joseph Stalins Great Purge from 1936 to 1938 severely damaged its progress In 1945 the Soviets captured several key Nazi German A4 V2 rocket production facilities and also gained the services of some German scientists and engineers related to the project A4s were assembled and studied and the experience derived from assembling and launching A4 rockets was directly applied to the Soviet copy called the R1 with NII88 chief designer Sergei Korolev overseeing the R1s development The R1 entered into service in the Soviet Army on 28 November 1950 By the latter half of 1946 Korolev and rocket engineer Valentin Glushko had with extensive input from German engineers outlined a successor to the R1 the R2 with an extended frame and a new engine designed by Glushko which entered service in November 1951 with a range of 600 kilometres 370 mi twice that of the R1 This was followed in 1951 with the development of the R5 Pobeda the Soviet Unions first real strategic missile with a range of 1200 km 750 mi and capable of carrying a 1 megaton mt thermonuclear warhead The R5 entered service in 1955 Scientific versions of the R1 R2 and R5 undertook various experiments between 1949 and 1958 including flights with space dogs 2123 Design work began in 1953 on the R7 Semyorka with the requirement for a missile with a launch mass of 170 to 200 tons range of 8500 km and carrying a 3000 kg 6600 lb nuclear warhead powerful enough to launch a nuclear warhead against the United States In late 1953 the warheads mass was increased to 55 to 6 tons to accommodate the then planned theromonuclear bomb The R7 was designed in a twostage configuration with four boosters that would jettison when empty On the 21 August 1957 the R7 flew 6000 km 3700 mi and became the worldss first intercontinental ballistic missile Two months later the R7 launched Sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite into orbit and became the basis for the R7 family which includes Sputnik Luna Molniya Vostok and Voskhod space launchers as well as later Soyuz variants Several versions are still in use and it has become the worlds most reliable space launcher American rocket development Although American rocket pioneer Robert H Goddard developed patented and flew small liquidpropellant rockets as early as 1914 the United States was the only one of the three major allied World War II powers to not have its own rocket program until Von Braun and his engineers were expatriated from Nazi Germany in 1945 The US acquired a large number of V2 rockets and recruited von Braun and most of his engineering team in Operation Paperclip The team was sent to the Armys White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico in 1945 They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation These tests led to the first photos of Earth from space and the first twostage rocket the WAC CorporalV2 combination in 1949 The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Armys new Redstone Arsenal located in Huntsville Alabama in 1950 From here von Braun and his team developed the Armys first operational mediumrange ballistic missile the Redstone rocket derivatives of which launched both Americas first satellite and the first piloted Mercury space missions It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets Each of the United States armed services had its own ICBM development program The Air Force began ICBM research in 1945 with the MX774 In 1950 von Braun began testing the Air Force PGM11 Redstone rocket family at Cape Canaveral By 1957 a descendant of the Air Force MX774 received toppriority funding and evolved into the AtlasA the first successful American ICBM The Atlas made use of a thin stainless steel fuel tank which relied on the internal pressure of the tank for structural integrity this allowed an overall lighter weight design WD40 was developed to prevent rust on the Atlas rockets so that rust protecting paint could be avoided to further reduce weight A later variant of the Atlas the AtlasD served as a nuclear ICBM and as the orbital launch vehicle for Project Mercury and the remotecontrolled Agena Target Vehicle used in Project Gemini ICBM capability satellites lunar probes 19551960 The period from 1955 to 1960 saw the first artificial satellites put into earth orbit by both the USSR and the US the first animals sent into orbit and the first robotic probes to impact and flyby the Moon by the Soviets Artificial satellite development In 1955 with both the United States and the Soviet Union building ballistic missiles that could be used to launch objects into space the stage was set for nationalistic competition On July 29 1955 James C Hagerty President Dwight D Eisenhowers press secretary announced that the United States intended to launch small Earth circling satellites between July 1 1957 and December 31 1958 as part of the US contribution to the International Geophysical Year IGY On August 2 at the Sixth Congress of the International Astronautical Federation in Copenhagen scientist Leonid I Sedov told international reporters at the Soviet embassy of his countrys intention to launch a satellite as well in the near future Soviet secrecy and obfuscation On August 30 1955 Sergei Korolev succeeded in convincing the Soviet Academy of Sciences to establish a commission dedicated to achieving the goal of launching a satellite into Earth orbit before the United States this can be viewed as the de facto start date of the space race The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union began a policy of treating development of its space program as topsecret When the Sputnik project was first approved one of the immediate courses of action the Politburo took was to consider what to announce to the world regarding their event The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union TASS established precedents for all official announcements on the Soviet space program The information eventually released did not offer details on who built and launched the satellite or why it was launched The Soviet space programs use of secrecy served as both a tool to prevent the leaking of classified information between countries and to avoid revealing specifics to the Soviet populace in regards to their short and long term goals the programs nature embodied ambiguous messages concerning its goals successes and values Launches were not announced until they took place cosmonaut names were not released until they flew and outside observers did not know the size or shape of their rockets or cabins of most of their spaceships except for the first Sputniks lunar probes and Venus probe The Soviet military maintained control over the space program Korolevs OKB1 design bureau was subordinated under the Ministry of General Machine Building tasked with the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and continued to give its assets random identifiers into the 1960s Information about failures was systematically withheld historian James Andrews notes that Soviet media coverage of the space program particularly human space missions rarely reported any failures or difficulties creating the impression of a flawless operationWith almost no exceptions coverage of Soviet space exploits especially in the case of human space missions omitted reports of failure or troubleDominic Phelan noted in the book Cold War Space Sleuths SpringerPraxis 2013 The USSR was famously described by Winston Churchill as a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma and nothing signified this more than the search for the truth behind its space program during the Cold War Although the Space Race was literally played out above our heads it was often obscured by a figurative space curtain that took much effort to see through US concerns and strategy Initially President Eisenhower was worried that a satellite passing above a nation at over 100 kilometers 62 mi might be seen as violating that nations airspace He was concerned that the Soviet Union would accuse the Americans of an illegal overflight thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense Eisenhower and his advisors were of the opinion that a nations airspace sovereignty did not extend past the Krmn line and they used the 195758 International Geophysical Year launches to establish this principle in international law Eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a warmonger if he were to use military missiles as launchers Therefore he selected the untried Naval Research Laboratorys Vanguard rocket which was a researchonly rocket This meant that von Brauns team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their JupiterC rocket because of its intended use as a future military vehicle On September 20 1956 von Braun and his team did launch a JupiterC that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of reentry vehicle technology Sputnik Korolev received word about von Brauns 1956 JupiterC test and mistakenly thinking it was a satellite mission that failed expedited plans to get his own satellite in orbit Since the R7 was substantially more powerful than any of the US launch vehicles he made sure to take full advantage of this capability by designing Object D as his primary satellite It was given the designation D to distinguish it from other R7 payload designations A B V and G which were nuclear weapon payloads Object D dwarfed the proposed US satellites having a weight of 1400 kilograms 3100 lb of which 300 kilograms 660 lb would be composed of scientific instruments that would photograph the Earth take readings on radiation levels and check on the planets magnetic field However things were not going along well with the design and manufacturing of the satellite so in February 1957 Korolev sought and received permission from the Council of Ministers to build a Prosteishy Sputnik PS1 or simple satellite The council also decreed that Object D be postponed until April 1958 The new Sputnik was a metallic sphere that would be a much lighter craft weighing 838 kilograms 185 lb and having a 58centimeter 23 in diameter The satellite would not contain the complex instrumentation that Object D had but had two radio transmitters operating on different short wave radio frequencies the ability to detect if a meteoroid were to penetrate its pressure hull and the ability to detect the density of the Earths thermosphere Korolev was buoyed by the first successful launches of the R7 rocket in August and September which paved the way for the launch of Sputnik Word came that the US was planning to announce a major breakthrough at an International Geophysical Year conference at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC with a paper titled Satellite Over the Planet on October 6 1957 Korolev anticipated that von Braun might launch a JupiterC with a satellite payload on or around October 4 or 5 in conjunction with the paper He hastened the launch moving it to October 4 The launch vehicle for PS1 was a modified R7 vehicle 8K71PS number M1PS without much of the test equipment and radio gear that was present in the previous launches It arrived at the Soviet missile base TyuraTam in September and was prepared for its mission at launch site number one The first launch took place on Friday October 4 1957 at exactly 102834 pm Moscow time with the R7 and the now named Sputnik 1 satellite lifting off the launch pad and placing the artificial moon into an orbit a few minutes later This fellow traveler as the name is translated in English was a small beeping ball less than two feet in diameter and weighing less than 200 pounds But the celebrations were muted at the launch control center until the downrange far east tracking station at Kamchatka received the first distinctive beep beep beep sounds from Sputnik 1s radio transmitters indicating that it was on its way to completing its first orbit About 95 minutes after launch the satellite flew over its launch site and its radio signals were picked up by the engineers and military personnel at TyuraTam thats when Korolev and his team celebrated the first successful artificial satellite placed into Earthorbit The next satellite sent by the Soviets after Sputnik 1 was Sputnik 2 launched on November 3 1957 just a month later This would put the first animal into orbit US reaction to Sputnik CIA assessment At the latest the successful start of Sputnik 2 with the satellite weighing more than 500 kg proved that the USSR had achieved a leading advantage in rocket technology The CIA initially astonished estimated the launch weight of the rocket at 500 metric tons requiring an initial thrust exceeding 1000 tons and assumed the use of a threestage rocket In a classified report the agency described the event as a stupendous scientific achievement and concluded that the USSR had likely perfected an intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM capable of accurately targeting any location In reality the launch weight of the Soviet rocket was 267 metric tons with an initial thrust of 410 tons with one and a half stages The CIAs misjudgement was caused by extrapolating the parameters of the US Atlas rocket developed at the same time launch weight 82 tons initial thrust 135 tones maximum payload of 70 kg for low Earth orbit In part the favourable data of the Soviet launcher was based on concepts proposed by the German rocket scientists headed by Helmut Grttrup on Gorodomlya Island such as among other things the rigorous weight saving the control of the residual fuel quantities and a reduced thrust to weight relation of 14 instead of usual factor 2 The CIA had heard about such details already in January 1954 when it interrogated Gttrup after his return from the USSR but did not take him seriously US reactions The Soviet success raised a great deal of concern in the United States For example economist Bernard Baruch wrote in an open letter titled The Lessons of Defeat to the New York Herald Tribune While we devote our industrial and technological power to producing new model automobiles and more gadgets the Soviet Union is conquering space It is Russia not the United States who has had the imagination to hitch its wagon to the stars and the skill to reach for the moon and all but grasp it America is worried It should be Eisenhower ordered project Vanguard to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned The December 6 1957 Project Vanguard launch failure occurred at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida It was a monumental failure exploding a few seconds after launch and it became an international joke The satellite appeared in newspapers under the names Flopnik Stayputnik Kaputnik and Dudnik In the United Nations the Soviet delegate offered the US representative aid under the Soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations Only in the wake of this very public failure did von Brauns Redstone team get the goahead to launch their JupiterC rocket as soon as they could In Britain the USs Western Cold War ally the reaction was mixed some celebrated the fact that the Soviets had reached space first while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring The Daily Express predicted that the US would catch up to and pass the USSR in space never doubt for a moment that America would be successful Explorer On January 31 1958 nearly four months after the launch of Sputnik 1 von Braun and the United States successfully launched its first satellite on a fourstage Juno I rocket derived from the US Armys Redstone missile at Cape Canaveral The satellite Explorer 1 was 3066 pounds 1391 kg in mass The payload of Explorer 1 weighed 1835 pounds 832 kg It carried a micrometeorite gauge and a GeigerMller tube It passed in and out of the Earthencompassing radiation belt with its 194by1368nauticalmile 360 by 2534 km orbit therefore saturating the tubes capacity and proving what Dr James Van Allen a space scientist at the University of Iowa had theorized The belt named the Van Allen radiation belt is a doughnutshaped zone of highlevel radiation intensity around the Earth above the magnetic equator Van Allen was also the man who designed and built the satellite instrumentation of Explorer 1 The satellite measured three phenomena cosmic ray and radiation levels the temperature in the spacecraft and the frequency of collisions with micrometeorites The satellite had no memory for data storage therefore it had to transmit continuously The next successful mission was Explorer 3 launched later that month March 26 1958 which carried similar scientific instruments and successfully recorded cosmic ray data Creation of NASA On April 2 1958 President Eisenhower reacted to the Soviet space lead in launching the first satellite by recommending to the US Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities Congress led by Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B Johnson responded by passing the National Aeronautics and Space Act which Eisenhower signed into law on July 29 1958 This law turned the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA It also created a CivilianMilitary Liaison Committee appointed by the President responsible for coordinating the nations civilian and military space programs On October 21 1959 Eisenhower approved the transfer of the Armys remaining spacerelated activities to NASA On July 1 1960 the Redstone Arsenal became NASAs George C Marshall Space Flight Center with von Braun as its first director Development of the Saturn rocket family which when mature gave the US parity with the Soviets in terms of lifting capability was thus transferred to NASA First mammals in space The US and the USSR sent animals into space to determine the safety of the environment before sending the first humans The USSR used dogs for this purpose and the US used monkeys and apes The first mammal in space was Albert II a rhesus monkey launched by the US on a suborbital flight on June 14 1949 who died on landing due to a parachute malfunction The USSR sent the dog Laika into orbit on Sputnik 2 the second satellite launched on November 3 1957 for an intended tenday flight They did not yet have the technology to return Laika safely to Earth and the government reported Laika died when the oxygen ran out but in October 2002 her true cause of death was reported as stress and overheating on the fourth orbit due to failure of the air conditioning system At a Moscow press conference in 1998 Oleg Gazenko a senior Soviet scientist involved in the project stated The more time passes the more Im sorry about it We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog Early lunar probes In 1958 Korolev upgraded the R7 to be able to launch a 400kilogram 880 lb payload to the Moon The Luna program began with three failed secret 1958 attempts to launch Luna E1class impactor probes The fourth attempt Luna 1 launched successfully on January 2 1959 but missed the Moon The fifth attempt on June 18 also failed at launch The 390kilogram 860 lb Luna 2 successfully impacted the Moon on September 14 1959 The 2785kilogram 614 lb Luna 3 successfully flew by the Moon and sent back pictures of its far side on October 7 1959 The US first embarked on the Pioneer program in 1958 by launching the first probe albeit ending in failure A subsequent probe named Pioneer 1 was launched with the intention of orbiting the Moon only to result in a partial mission success when it reached an apogee of 113800 km before falling back to Earth The missions of Pioneer 2 and Pioneer 3 failed whereas Pioneer 4 had one partially successful lunar flyby in March 1959 Human spaceflight space treaties interplanetary probes 19611968 The period from 1961 to 1968 began with the first men sent to space the first robotic explorations of other planets with missions to Venus and Mars conducted by both the Soviet Union and the United States robotic landings on the Moon and the gestation of US ambition to land a man on the moon The 60s saw significant advancements in crewed spaceflight by both cold war adversaries as well as the first nuclear detonation in space research into antisatellite technology and the signing of historic international outer space treaties First humans in space Vostok The Soviets designed their first human space capsule using the same spacecraft bus as their Zenit spy satellite forcing them to keep the details and true appearance secret until after the Vostok program was over The craft consisted of a spherical descent module with a mass of 246 tonnes 5400 lb and a diameter of 23 meters 75 ft with a cylindrical inner cabin housing the cosmonaut instruments and escape system and a biconic instrument module with a mass of 227 tonnes 5000 lb 225 meters 74 ft long and 243 meters 80 ft in diameter containing the engine system and propellant After reentry the cosmonaut would eject at about 7000 meters 23000 ft over the USSR and descend via parachute while the capsule would land separately because the descent module made an extremely rough landing that could have left a cosmonaut seriously injured The Vostok spaceship was first displayed at the July 1961 Tushino air show mounted on its launch vehicles third stage with the nose cone in place concealing the spherical capsule A tail section with eight fins was added in an apparent attempt to confuse western observers This also appeared on official commemorative stamps and a documentary The Soviets finally revealed the true appearance of their Vostok capsule at the April 1965 Moscow Economic Exhibition On April 12 1961 the USSR surprised the world by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single 108minute orbit around the Earth in a craft called Vostok 1 They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut roughly translated from Russian and Greek as sailor of the universe Gagarins capsule was flown in automatic mode since doctors did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space but Gagarin was given an envelope containing the code that would unlock manual control in an emergency Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc and a worldwide celebrity Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations the scale of which was second only to the World War II Victory Parade of 1945 April 12 was declared Cosmonautics Day in the USSR and is celebrated today in Russia as one of the official Commemorative Dates of Russia In 2011 it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations The USSR demonstrated 24hour launch pad turnaround and launched two piloted spacecraft Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 in essentially identical orbits on August 11 and 12 1962 The two spacecraft came within approximately 65 kilometers 35 nautical miles of one another close enough for radio communication but then drifted as far apart as 2850 kilometers 1540 nautical miles The Vostok had no maneuvering rockets to keep the two craft a controlled distance apart Vostok 4 also set a record of nearly four days in space The first woman Valentina Tereshkova was launched into space on Vostok 6 on June 16 1963 as possibly a medical experiment She was the only one to fly of a small group of female parachutist factory workers unlike the male cosmonauts who were military test pilots chosen by the head of cosmonaut training because he read a tabloid article about the Mercury 13 group of women wanting to become astronauts and got the mistaken idea that NASA was actually entertaining this Five months after her flight Tereshkova married Vostok 3 cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev and they had a daughter Mercury The US Air Force had been developing a program to launch the first man in space named Man in Space Soonest This program studied several different types of oneman space vehicles settling on a ballistic reentry capsule launched on a derivative Atlas missile and selecting a group of nine candidate pilots After NASAs creation the program was transferred over to the civilian agencys Space Task Group and renamed Project Mercury on November 26 1958 The Mercury spacecraft was designed by the STGs chief engineer Maxime Faget NASA selected a new group of astronaut from the Greek for star sailor candidates from Navy Air Force and Marine test pilots and narrowed this down to a group of seven for the program Capsule design and astronaut training began immediately working toward preliminary suborbital flights on the Redstone missile followed by orbital flights on the Atlas Each flight series would first start unpiloted then carry a nonhuman primate then finally humans The Mercury spacecrafts principal designer was Maxime Faget who started research for human spaceflight during the time of the NACA It consisted of a conical capsule with a cylindrical pack of three solidfuel retrorockets strapped over a beryllium or fiberglass heat shield on the blunt end Base diameter at the blunt end was 60 feet 18 m and length was 108 feet 33 m with the launch escape system added the overall length was 259 feet 79 m With 100 cubic feet 28 m3 of habitable volume the capsule was just large enough for a single astronaut The first suborbital spacecraft weighed 3000 pounds 1400 kg the heaviest MercuryAtlas 9 weighed 3000 pounds 1400 kg fully loaded On reentry the astronaut would stay in the craft through splashdown by parachute in the Atlantic Ocean On May 5 1961 Alan Shepard became the first American in space launching in a ballistic trajectory on MercuryRedstone 3 in a spacecraft he named Freedom 7 Though he did not achieve orbit like Gagarin he was the first person to exercise manual control over his spacecrafts attitude and retrorocket firing After his successful return Shepard was celebrated as a national hero honored with parades in Washington New York and Los Angeles and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F Kennedy American Virgil Gus Grissom repeated Shepards suborbital flight in Liberty Bell 7 on July 21 1961 Almost a year after the Soviet Union put a human into orbit astronaut John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth on February 20 1962 His MercuryAtlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the Friendship 7 spacecraft and splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean after a tense reentry due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heatshield On February 23 1962 President Kennedy awarded Glenn with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in a ceremony at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station As the first American in orbit Glenn became a national hero and received a tickertape parade in New York City reminiscent of that given for Charles Lindbergh The United States launched three more Mercury flights after Glenns Aurora 7 on May 24 1962 duplicated Glenns three orbits Sigma 7 on October 3 1962 six orbits and Faith 7 on May 15 1963 22 orbits 324 hours the maximum capability of the spacecraft NASA at first intended to launch one more mission extending the spacecrafts endurance to three days but since this would not beat the Soviet record it was decided instead to concentrate on developing Project Gemini Kennedy aims for a manned Moon landing Before Gagarins flight US President John F Kennedys support for Americas piloted space program was lukewarm Jerome Wiesner of MIT who served as a science advisor to presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy and himself an opponent of sending humans into space remarked If Kennedy could have opted out of a big space program without hurting the country in his judgment he would have As late as March 1961 when NASA administrator James E Webb submitted a budget request to fund a Moon landing before 1970 Kennedy rejected it because it was simply too expensive Some were surprised by Kennedys eventual support of NASA and the space program because of how often he had attacked the Eisenhower administrations inefficiency during the election Gagarins flight changed this now Kennedy sensed the humiliation and fear on the part of the American public over the Soviet lead Additionally the Bay of Pigs invasion planned before his term began but executed during it was an embarrassment to his administration due to the colossal failure of the US forces Looking for something to save political face he sent a memo dated April 20 1961 to Vice President Lyndon B Johnson asking him to look into the state of Americas space program and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up The two major options at the time were either the establishment of an Earth orbital space station or a crewed landing on the Moon Johnson in turn consulted with von Braun who answered Kennedys questions based on his estimates of US and Soviet rocket lifting capability Based on this Johnson responded to Kennedy concluding that much more was needed to reach a position of leadership and recommending that the crewed Moon landing was far enough in the future that the US had a fighting chance to achieve it first Kennedy ultimately decided to pursue what became the Apollo program and on May 25 took the opportunity to ask for Congressional support in a Cold War speech titled Special Message on Urgent National Needs Full text He justified the program in terms of its importance to national security and its focus of the nations energies on other scientific and social fields He rallied popular support for the program in his We choose to go to the Moon speech on September 12 1962 before a large crowd at Rice University Stadium in Houston Texas near the construction site of the new Lyndon B Johnson Space Center facility Full text Khrushchev responded to Kennedys challenge with silence refusing to publicly confirm or deny the Soviets were pursuing a Moon race As later disclosed the Soviet Union secretly pursued two competing crewed lunar programs Soviet Decree 655268 On Work on the Exploration of the Moon and Mastery of Space issued in August 1964 directed Vladimir Chelomei to develop a Moon flyby program with a projected first flight by the end of 1966 and directed Korolev to develop the Moon landing program with a first flight by the end of 1967 In September 1965 Chelomeis flyby program was assigned to Korolev who redesigned the cislunar mission to use his own Soyuz 7KL1 spacecraft and Chelomeis Proton rocket After Korolevs death in January 1966 another government decree of February 1967 moved the first crewed flyby to mid1967 and the first crewed landing to the end of 1968 Proposed joint USUSSR program After a first USUSSR DrydenBlagonravov agreement and cooperation on the Echo II balloon satellite in 1962 President Kennedy proposed on September 20 1963 in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly that the United States and the Soviet Union join forces in an effort to reach the Moon Kennedy thus changed his mind regarding the desirability of the space race preferring instead to ease tensions with the Soviet Union by cooperating on projects such as a joint lunar landing Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev initially rejected Kennedys proposal However on October 2 1997 it was reported that Khrushchevs son Sergei claimed Khrushchev was poised to accept Kennedys proposal at the time of Kennedys assassination on November 22 1963 During the next few weeks he reportedly concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture and decided to accept Kennedys offer based on a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the worlds two superpowers but changed his mind and dropped the idea since he lacked the same trust for Kennedys successor Lyndon Johnson Some cooperation in robotic space exploration nevertheless did take place such as a combined Venera 4Mariner 5 data analysis under a joint SovietAmerican working group of COSPAR in 1969 allowing a more complete drawing of the profile of the atmosphere of Venus Eventually the ApolloSoyuz mission was realized afterall which furthermore laid the foundations for the ShuttleMir program and the ISS As President Johnson steadfastly pursued the Gemini and Apollo programs promoting them as Kennedys legacy to the American public One week after Kennedys death he issued Executive Order 11129 renaming the Cape Canaveral and Apollo launch facilities after Kennedy Lunar probes and robotic landers The Ranger program started in 1959 by NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory aimed to conduct hard impacts on the moon and had its first success in 1962 after 3 failures due to launch aborts Ranger 1 and Ranger 2 and a failure to reach the moon Ranger 3 when the 730pound 330 kg Ranger 4 became the first US spacecraft to reach the Moon but its solar panels and navigational system failed near the Moon and it impacted the far side without returning any scientific data Ranger 5 ran out of power and missed the Moon by 725 kilometers 391 nmi on October 21 1962 The first successful Ranger mission was the 806pound 366 kg Block III Ranger 7 which impacted on July 31 1964 Ranger had three successful impacts out of nine attempts In 1963 the Soviet Unions 2nd Generation Luna programme was less successful than the earlier Luna probes Luna 4 Luna 5 Luna 6 Luna 7 and Luna 8 were all met with mission failures However in 1966 the Luna 9 achieved the first softlanding on the Moon and successfully transmitted photography from the surface Luna 10 marked the first manmade object to establish an orbit around the Moon followed by Luna 11 Luna 12 and Luna 14 which also successfully established orbits Luna 12 was able to transmit detailed photography of the surface from orbit Luna 10 12 and Luna 14 conducted Gamma ray spectrometry of the Moon among other tests The Zond programme was orchestrated alongside the Luna programme with Zond 1 and Zond 2 launching in 1964 intended as flyby missions however both failed Zond 3 however was successful and transmitted high quality photography from the far side of the moon Partly to aid the Apollo missions the Surveyor program was conducted by NASA with five successful soft landings out of seven attempts from 1966 to 1968 The Lunar Orbiter program had five successes out of five attempts in 19661967 In late 1966 Luna 13 became the third spacecraft to make a softlanding on the Moon with the American Surveyor 1 having now taken second Luna 13 made use of inflatable airbags to soften its landing Surveyor 1 was a 995 kg lander notably larger than the 112 kg Luna 13 E6M lander Surveyor 1 was equipped with a Doppler velocity sensing system that fed information into the spacecraft computer to implement a controllable descent to the surface Each of the three landing pads also carried aircrafttype shock absorbers and strain gauges to provide data on landing characteristics important for future Apollo missions Surveyor 3 which successfully touched down on the Moon April 20 1967 carried a surface sampler which facilitated tests of the Lunar soil Based on these experiments scientists concluded that lunar soil had a consistency similar to wet sand with a bearing strength of about 10 pounds per square inch 07 kilograms per square centimeter or 98 kilopascals which was concluded to be solid enough to support an Apollo Lunar Module The Surveyor 3 lander would be later visited by Apollo 12 astronauts On Nov 17 1967 before mission termination Surveyor 6 fired its thrusters for 25 seconds becoming the first spacecraft launched from the lunar surface It rose about 10 feet 3 meters before landing 8 feet 25 meters west of its original spot Cameras then examined the original landing site to assess the soils properties First interplanetary probes From the early 60s both cold war adversaries almost simultaneously initiated their own programmes which sought to reach other planets in the solar system for the first time namely Venus and Mars Venus Venus was of great interest in the field of planetary science due to its thick and opaque atmosphere the atmospheres of other planets being a novel area of research at the time In 1961 the Venera Programme was initiated by the Soviet Union with the launch of Venera 1 The programme would go on to mark many firsts in the exploration of another planet Despite the later successes however Venera 1 and Venera 2 intended to flyby Venus resulted in failure due to losses of contact NASA would then initiate the Mariner program with the launch of Mariner 1 and Mariner 2 Mariner 1 failed shortly after launch however Mariner 2 would become the first manmade object to flyby another Planet in December 1962 when the probe passed by Venus Later in 196566 Venera 3 marked the first time a manmade object made contact with another planet after it impacted Venus on March 1 1966 despite operational difficulties resulting in loss of contact with the craft In 1967 Mariner 5 flew by Venus and conducted atmospheric analysis Mars In 1964 NASAs Mariner 4 became the first successful Mars flyby transmitting 21 pictures of the planets surface This was followed by Mariner 6 and 7 in 1969 First crewed spacecraft Focused by the commitment to a Moon landing in January 1962 the US announced Project Gemini a twoperson spacecraft that would support the later threeperson Apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft flight durations of sufficient length to go to the Moon and back and extravehicular activity to perform work outside the spacecraft Meanwhile Korolev had planned further longterm missions for the Vostok spacecraft and had four Vostoks in various stages of fabrication in late 1963 at his OKB1 facilities The Americans announced plans for Gemini represented major advances over the Mercury and Vostok capsules and Korolev felt the need to try to beat the Americans to many of these innovations He had already begun designing the Vostoks replacement the nextgeneration Soyuz a multicosmonaut spacecraft that had at least the same capabilities as the Gemini spacecraft Soyuz would not be available for at least three years and it could not be called upon to deal with this new American challenge in 1964 or 1965 Political pressure in early 1964 which some sources claim was from Khrushchev while other sources claim was from other Communist Party officials pushed him to modify his four remaining Vostoks to beat the Americans to new space firsts in the size of flight crews and the duration of missions Voskhod Korolevs conversion of his surplus Vostok capsules to the Voskhod spacecraft allowed the Soviet space program to beat the Gemini program in achieving the first spaceflight with a multiperson crew and the first spacewalk Gemini took a year longer than planned to make its first flight so Voskhod 1 became the first spaceflight with a threeperson crew on October 12 1964 The USSR touted another technological achievement during this mission it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirtsleeveenvironment However flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecrafts environmental systems rather this was because the crafts limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization This was not repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968 the command module cabin was designed to transport three astronauts in a low pressure pure oxygen shirtsleeve environment while in space On March 18 1965 about a week before the first piloted Project Gemini space flight the USSR launched the twocosmonaut Voskhod 2 mission with Pavel Belyayev and Alexei Leonov Voskhod 2s design modifications included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow for extravehicular activity EVA also known as a spacewalk while keeping the cabin pressurized so that the capsules electronics would not overheat Leonov performed the firstever EVA as part of the mission A fatality was narrowly avoided when Leonovs spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space preventing him from reentering the airlock To overcome this he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level He succeeded in safely reentering the spacecraft but he and Belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecrafts atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45 pure oxygen which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before reentry The reentry involved two more challenges an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the Voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometers 240 mi off its designated target area the city of Perm and the instrument compartments failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry By October 16 1964 Leonid Brezhnev and a small cadre of highranking Communist Party officials deposed Khrushchev as Soviet government leader a day after Voskhod 1 landed in what was called the Wednesday conspiracy The new political leaders along with Korolev ended the technologically troublesome Voskhod program canceling Voskhod 3 and 4 which were in the planning stages and started concentrating on reaching the Moon Voskhod 2 ended up being Korolevs final achievement before his death on January 14 1966 as it became the last of the space firsts that the USSR achieved during the early 1960s According to historian Asif Siddiqi Korolevs accomplishments marked the absolute zenith of the Soviet space program one never ever attained since There was a twoyear pause in Soviet piloted space flights while Voskhods replacement the Soyuz spacecraft was designed and developed Gemini Though delayed a year to reach its first flight Gemini was able to take advantage of the USSRs twoyear hiatus after Voskhod which enabled the US to catch up and surpass the previous Soviet superiority in piloted spaceflight Gemini had ten crewed missions between March 1965 and November 1966 Gemini 3 Gemini 4 Gemini 5 Gemini 6A Gemini 7 Gemini 8 Gemini 9A Gemini 10 Gemini 11 and Gemini 12 and accomplished the following Every mission demonstrated the ability to adjust the crafts inclination and apsis without issue Gemini 5 demonstrated eightday endurance long enough for a round trip to the Moon Gemini 7 demonstrated a fourteenday endurance flight Gemini 6A demonstrated rendezvous and stationkeeping with Gemini 7 for three consecutive orbits at distances as close as 1 foot 030 m Gemini 9A also achieved rendezvous with an Agena Target Vehicle ATV Rendezvous and docking with the ATV was achieved on Gemini 8 10 11 and 12 Gemini 11 achieved the first directascent rendezvous with its Agena target on the first orbit Extravehicular activity EVA was perfected through increasing practice on Gemini 4 9A 10 11 and 12 On Gemini 12 Edwin Buzz Aldrin spent over five hours working comfortably during three EVA sessions finally proving that humans could perform productive tasks outside their spacecraft Gemini 10 11 and 12 used the ATVs engine to make large changes in its orbit while docked Gemini 11 used the Agenas rocket to achieve a crewed Earth orbit record apogee of 742 nautical miles 1374 km Gemini 8 experienced the first inspace mission abort on March 17 1966 just after achieving the worlds first docking when a stuck or shorted thruster sent the craft into an uncontrolled spin Command pilot Neil Armstrong was able to shut off the stuck thruster and stop the spin by using the reentry control system He and his crewmate David Scott landed and were recovered safely Most of the novice pilots on the early missions would command the later missions In this way Project Gemini built up spaceflight experience for the pool of astronauts for the Apollo lunar missions With the completion of Gemini the US had demonstrated many of the key technologies necessary to make Kennedys goal of landing a man on the Moon namely manned spacecraft docking with the exception of developing a large enough launch vehicle Soviet crewed Moon programs Korolevs design bureau produced two prospectuses for circumlunar spaceflight March 1962 and May 1963 the main spacecraft for which were early versions of his Soyuz design At the same time another bureau OKB52 headed by Vladimir Chelomey was developing the LK1 lunar flyby spacecraft which would be launched by Chelomeys Proton UR500 rocket The Soviet government rejected Korolevs proposals opting to support Chelomeys project who gained favor with Khrushchev by employing his son Officially the Soviet lunar program was established on August 3 1964 with the adoption of Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Command 655268 On Work on the Exploration of the Moon and Mastery of Space The circumlunar flights were planned to occur in 1967 and the landings to start in 1968 intending to land a person on the Moon before the Apollo flights Both of the bureaus submitted their projects for a crewed lunar landing Korolevs lunar landing program was designated N1L3 for its N1 super rocket and a more advanced Soyuz 7KL3 spacecraft also known as the lunar orbital module Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl LOK with a crew of two A separate lunar lander Lunniy Korabl LK would carry a single cosmonaut to the lunar surface The N1L3 launch vehicle had three stages to Earth orbit a fourth stage for Earth departure and a fifth stage for lunar landing assist The combined space vehicle was roughly the same height and takeoff mass as the threestage US ApolloSaturn V and exceeded its takeoff thrust by 28 45400 kN vs 33000 kN The N13L was never successfully tested the first flight suffered a fire in the firststage Block A due to a loose bolt leading to a catastrophic explosion 70 seconds into the flight Further variations of the N1 had similar catastrophic results in testing If successful the N1 would have been capable of carrying a 95 metric tons payload into low earth orbit The Saturn V comparatively used liquid hydrogen fuel in its two upper stages and carried a 1406 metric tons payload to orbit enough for a threeperson orbiter and twoperson lander Chelomeys program assumed using a direct ascent lander based on the LK1 LK700 which would be launched using his proposed UR700 rocket Following Khrushchevs ouster from power Chelomey lost his support in the Soviet government and his proposal didnt receive any funding Additionally in August 1965 due to Korolevs opposition work on the LK1 was suspended and later stopped completely As a replacement the circumlunar mission would use a strippeddown Soyuz 7KL1 Zond while still retaining the Proton UR500 booster To fit two crewmembers the Zond had to omit the Soyuz orbital module sacrificing equipment for habitable cabin volume Outer space treaties The US and USSR began discussions on the peaceful uses of space as early as 1958 presenting issues for debate to the United Nations which created a Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 1959 On May 10 1962 Vice President Johnson addressed the Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space revealing that the United States and the USSR both supported a resolution passed by the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly in December 1962 which not only urged member nations to extend the rules of international law to outer space but to also cooperate in its exploration Following the passing of this resolution Kennedy commenced his communications proposing a cooperative American and Soviet space program In 1963 the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed by more than 100 signatories including both the United States and the Soviet Union This treaty followed the US test of a nuclear bomb detonated in outer space the year earlier called Starfish Prime The UN ultimately created a Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies which was signed by the United States the USSR and the United Kingdom on January 27 1967 and came into force the following October 10 This treaty bars party States from placing weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit on the Moon or any other celestial body exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind conducting military maneuvers or establishing military bases installations and fortifications declares that the exploration of outer space shall be done to benefit all countries and shall be free for exploration and use by all the States explicitly forbids any government from claiming a celestial resource such as the Moon or a planet claiming that they are the common heritage of mankind not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty by means of use or occupation or by any other means However the State that launches a space object retains jurisdiction and control over that object holds any State liable for damages caused by their space object declares that the activities of nongovernmental entities in outer space including the Moon and other celestial bodies shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty and States Parties shall bear international responsibility for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or nongovernmental entities and A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space including the Moon and other celestial bodies would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space including the Moon and other celestial bodies may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment The treaty remains in force signed by 107 member states As of July 2017 AntiSatellite research Istrebitelsputnikov In November 1968 dismay gripped the United States Central Intelligence Agency when a successful satellite destruction simulation was successfully orchestrated by the Soviet Union As a part of the Istrebitel Sputnikov antisatellite weapons research programme the Kosmos 248 Soviet satellite was successfully destroyed by Kosmos 252 which was able to intercept within the 5km kill radius and destroyed Kosmos 248 by detonating its onboard warhead This wasnt the beginning of the programme years earlier intercept attempts had begun with maneuvering test of the Polyot satellites in 1964 SAINT Possibly as a response to the Soviet programme the United States began Project SAINT which was intended to provide antisatellite capability to be used in the case of war with the Soviet Union However less is known about the mission profiles of this project compared to the Soviet programme and the project was cancelled early on due to budget constraints Disaster strikes both sides In 1967 both nations space programs faced serious challenges that brought them to temporary halts Apollo 1 On January 27 1967 the same day the US and USSR signed the Outer Space Treaty the crew of the first crewed Apollo mission Command Pilot Virgil Gus Grissom Senior Pilot Ed White and Pilot Roger Chaffee were killed in a fire that swept through their spacecraft cabin during a ground test less than a month before the planned February 21 launch An investigative board determined the fire was probably caused by an electrical spark and quickly grew out of control fed by the spacecrafts atmosphere of pure oxygen at greater than one standard atmosphere Crew escape was made impossible by inability to open the plug door hatch cover against the internal pressure The board also found design and construction flaws in the spacecraft and procedural failings including failure to appreciate the hazard of the pureoxygen atmosphere as well as inadequate safety procedures All these flaws had to be corrected over the next twentytwo months until the first piloted flight could be made Mercury and Gemini veteran Grissom had been a favored choice of Deke Slayton NASAs Director of Flight Crew Operations to make the first piloted landing Soyuz 1 On April 24 1967 the single pilot of Soyuz 1 Vladimir Komarov became the first inflight spaceflight fatality The mission was planned to be a threeday test to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted Soyuz 2 but the mission was plagued with problems Problems began shortly after launch when one solar panel failed to unfold leading to a shortage of power for the spacecrafts systems Further problems with the orientation detectors complicated maneuvering the craft By orbit 13 the automatic stabilisation system was completely dead and the manual system was only partially effective The mission was aborted Soyuz 1 fired its retrorockets and reentered the Earths atmosphere During the emergency reentry a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute causing descent speed to reach as high as 40 ms 140 kmh 89 mph Shortly thereafter Soyuz 1 impacted the ground 3 km 19 mi west of Karabutak and was found on fire The official autopsy states Komarov died of blunt force trauma on impact In the US during subsequent years stories began circulating that in his last transmissions Komarov cursed the engineers and flight staff as he descended or even that he cursed the Soviet leadership and that these transmissions were received by an NSA listening station near Istanbul This would contradict Soviet records of the radio transcripts and historians such as Asif Azam Siddiqi and Robert Pearlman regard these claims to be fabrications Both programs recover The United States recovered from the Apollo 1 fire fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the Block II command module The US proceeded with unpiloted test launches of the Saturn V launch vehicle Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 and the Lunar Module Apollo 5 during the latter half of 1967 and early 1968 The first Saturn V flight was an unqualified success and although the second suffered some noncatastrophic engine failures it was considered a partial success and the launcher achieved human rating qualification Apollo 1s mission to check out the Apollo Command and Service Module in Earth orbit was accomplished by Grissoms backup crew on Apollo 7 launched on October 11 1968 The elevenday mission was a total success as the spacecraft performed a virtually flawless mission paving the way for the United States to continue with its lunar mission schedule The Soviet Union also fixed the parachute and control problems with Soyuz and the next piloted mission Soyuz 3 was launched on October 26 1968 The goal was to complete Komarovs rendezvous and docking mission with the unpiloted Soyuz 2 Ground controllers brought the two craft to within 200 meters 660 ft of each other then cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy took control He got within 40 meters 130 ft of his target but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced Soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft The first docking of Soviet spacecraft was finally realized in January 1969 by the Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 missions It was the firstever docking of two crewed spacecraft and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another The Soviet Zond spacecraft was not yet ready for piloted circumlunar missions in 1968 after six unsuccessful automated test launches Kosmos 146 on March 10 1967 Kosmos 154 on April 8 1967 Zond 1967A on September 28 1967 Zond 1967B on November 22 1967 Zond 1968A on April 23 1968 and Zond 1968B in July 1968 Zond 4 was launched on March 2 1968 and successfully made a circumlunar flight but encountered problems with its Earth reentry on March 9 and was ordered destroyed by an explosive charge 15000 meters 49000 ft over the Gulf of Guinea The Soviet official announcement said that Zond 4 was an automated test flight which ended with its intentional destruction due to its recovery trajectory positioning it over the Atlantic Ocean instead of over the USSR During the summer of 1968 the Apollo program hit another snag the first pilotrated Lunar Module LM was not ready for orbital tests in time for a December 1968 launch NASA planners overcame this challenge by changing the mission flight order delaying the first LM flight until March 1969 and sending Apollo 8 into lunar orbit without the LM in December This mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the Soviet Union might be ready for a piloted Zond flight in late 1968 In September 1968 Zond 5 made a circumlunar flight with tortoises on board and returned safely to Earth accomplishing the first successful water landing of the Soviet space program in the Indian Ocean It also scared NASA planners as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight not piloted because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the Moon On November 10 1968 another automated test flight Zond 6 was launched It encountered difficulties in Earth reentry and depressurized and deployed its parachute too early causing it to crashland only 16 kilometers 99 mi from where it had been launched six days earlier It turned out there was no chance of a piloted Soviet circumlunar flight during 1968 due to the unreliability of the Zonds On December 21 1968 Frank Borman James Lovell and William Anders became the first humans to ride the Saturn V rocket into space on Apollo 8 They also became the first to leave lowEarth orbit and go to another celestial body entering lunar orbit on December 24 They made ten orbits in twenty hours and transmitted one of the most watched TV broadcasts in history with their Christmas Eve program from lunar orbit which concluded with a reading from the biblical Book of Genesis Two and a half hours after the broadcast they fired their engine to perform the first transEarth injection to leave lunar orbit and return to the Earth Apollo 8 safely landed in the Pacific Ocean on December 27 in NASAs first dawn splashdown and recovery The American Lunar Module was finally ready for a successful piloted test flight in low Earth orbit on Apollo 9 in March 1969 The next mission Apollo 10 conducted a dress rehearsal for the first landing in May 1969 flying the LM in lunar orbit as close as 47400 feet 144 km above the surface the point where the powered descent to the surface would begin With the LM proven to work well the next step was to attempt the landing Unknown to the Americans the Soviet Moon program was in deep trouble After two successive launch failures of the N1 rocket in 1969 Soviet plans for a piloted landing suffered delay The launch pad explosion of the N1 on July 3 1969 was a significant setback The rocket hit the pad after an engine shutdown destroying itself and the launch facility Without the N1 rocket the USSR could not send a large enough payload to the Moon to land a human and return him safely Men on the Moon space stations space shuttles 19691991 The latter period of the space race began with the United States landing the first men on the moon and was followed by the Soviets operating the first space stations and putting the first robotic landers on Venus and Mars the US space shuttles marking the first significant reusable space vehicles and a cooling down of tensions with the first docking between a Soviet and American vessel First humans on the Moon Apollo 11 was prepared with the goal of a July landing in the Sea of Tranquility just half a year after the first crewed flight to the Moon The crew selected in January 1969 consisted of commander CDR Neil Armstrong Command Module Pilot CMP Michael Collins and Lunar Module Pilot LMP Edwin Buzz Aldrin They trained for the mission until just before the launch day On July 16 1969 at 932 am EDT the Saturn V rocket AS506 lifted off from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 in Florida The trip to the Moon took just over three days After achieving orbit Armstrong and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module named Eagle leaving Collins in the Command and Service Module Columbia and began their descent Despite the interruption of alarms from an overloaded computer caused by an antenna switch left in the wrong position Armstrong took over manual flight control at about 180 meters 590 ft to correct a slight downrange guidance error and set the Eagle down on a safe landing spot at 201804 UTC July 20 1969 31704 pm CDT Six hours later at 0256 UTC July 21 956 pm CDT July 20 Armstrong left the Eagle to become the first human to set foot on the Moon The first step was witnessed on live television by at least onefifth of the population of Earth or about 723 million people His first words when he stepped off the LMs landing footpad were Thats one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind Aldrin joined him on the surface almost 20 minutes later Altogether they spent just under two and onequarter hours outside their craft The next day they performed the first manned launch from another celestial body and rendezvoused back with Collins in Columbia But before they return ascended the Space Race came to a particular culmination Few days before Apollo 11 left Earth the Soviet Union launched the Luna 15 probe entering lunar orbit just before Apollo 11 and eventually sharing it with Apollo 11 Aware of Luna 15 Apollo 8 astronaut Frank Borman was asked to use his goodwill contacts in the Soviet Union to prevent any collision Subsequently in one of the first instances of SovietAmerican space communication the Soviet Union released Luna 15s flight plan to ensure it would not collide with Apollo 11 although its exact mission was not publicized But as Apollo 11 was wrapping up surface activities the Soviet mission command hastened Luna 15 and attempted its robotic samplereturn mission before Apollo 11 would return As Luna 15 descended just two hours before Apollo 11s launch and impacted at 1550 UTC some hundred kilometers away from Apollo 11 British astronomers monitoring Luna 15 recorded the situation with one commentingI say this has really been drama of the highest order Apollo 11 left lunar orbit and returned to Earth landing safely in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 1969 When the spacecraft splashed down 2982 days had passed since Kennedys commitment to landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth before the end of the decade the mission was completed with 161 days to spare With the safe completion of the Apollo 11 mission the Americans won the race to the Moon Armstrong and his crew became worldwide celebrities feted with tickertape parades on August 13 in New York City and Chicago attended by an estimated six million That evening in Los Angeles they were honored at an official state dinner attended by members of Congress 44 governors the Chief Justice of the United States and ambassadors from 83 nations The President and Vice president presented each astronaut with the Presidential Medal of Freedom The astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on September 16 1969 This began a 38day world tour to 22 foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries The publics reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing which affected the reaction A portion of the populace did not give it any attention and another portion was angered by it The first landing was followed by another precision landing on Apollo 12 in November 1969 within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft which landed on April 20 1967 In total the Apollo programme involved six manned Moon landings from 1969 to 1972 and a total of twelve astronauts walked on the surface of the Moon These were Apollo 11 Apollo 12 Apollo 14 Apollo 15 Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 PostApollo NASA Shifting goals and budget cuts NASA had ambitious followon human spaceflight plans as it reached its lunar goal but soon discovered it had expended most of its political capital to do so A victim of its own success Apollo had achieved its first landing goal with enough spacecraft and Saturn V launchers left for a total of ten lunar landings through Apollo 20 conducting extendedduration missions and transporting the landing crews in Lunar Roving Vehicles on the last five NASA also planned an Apollo Applications Program AAP to develop a longerduration Earth orbital workshop later named Skylab from a spent SIVB upper stage to be constructed in orbit using several launches of the smaller Saturn IB launch vehicle In February 1969 President Richard M Nixon convened a space task group to set recommendations for the future US civilian space program headed by his vice president Spiro T Agnew Agnew was an enthusiastic proponent of NASAs followup plans for permanent space stations in Earth and lunar orbit perhaps a base on the lunar surface and the first human flight to Mars as early as 1986 or as late as 2000 These would be serviced by an infrastructure of a reusable Space Transportation System including an Earthtoorbit Space Shuttle Nixon had a better sense of the declining political support in Congress for new Apollostyle programs which had disappeared with the achievement of the landing and he intended to pursue dtente with the USSR and China which he hoped might ease Cold War tensions He cut the spending proposal he sent to Congress to include funding for only the Space Shuttle with perhaps an option to pursue the Earth orbital space station for the foreseeable future AAP planners decided the Earth orbital workshop could be accomplished more efficiently by prefabricating it on the ground and launching it with a single Saturn V which immediately eliminated Apollo 20 Budget cuts soon led NASA to cut Apollo 18 and 19 as well Apollo 13 had to abort its lunar landing in April 1970 due to an inflight spacecraft failure but returned its crew safely to Earth The Apollo program made its final lunar landing in December 1972 the two unused Saturn Vs were used as outdoor visitor displays and allowed to deteriorate due to the effects of weathering The USSR continued trying to develop its N1 rocket after two more launch failures in 1971 and 1972 finally canceling it in May 1974 without achieving a single successful uncrewed test flight Soviet Lunar sample return and robotic rovers In late 1970 Luna 16 was launched by the Soviet Union and became the first unmanned probe to return a sample from the Moon This was followed by Luna 20 and Luna 24 in subsequent years The Soviet Union was also able to successfully land the first robotic rover on the moon in 1970 followed by another in 1973 with the Lunokhod missions These missions demonstrated continued Soviet willingness to compete with the US in the space race despite having lost the manned moon landing aspect of the space race Salyut and Skylab Having lost the race to the Moon the USSR seemed to decide to concentrate on orbital space stations instead of pursuing a crewed lunar mission During 1969 and 1970 they launched six more Soyuz flights after Soyuz 3 and then launched a series of six successful space stations plus two failures to achieve orbit and one station rendered uninhabitable due to damage from explosion of the launchers upper stage on their ProtonK heavylift launcher in their Salyut program designed by Kerim Kerimov Each one weighed between 18500 and 19824 kilograms 40786 and 43704 lb was 20 meters 66 ft long by 4 meters 13 ft in diameter and had a habitable volume of 99 cubic meters 3500 cu ft All of the Salyuts were presented to the public as nonmilitary scientific laboratories but three of them were covers for military Almaz reconnaissance stations Salyut 2 failed Salyut 3 and Salyut 5 Salyut 1 the first space station was launched by the Soviets on April 19 1971 Three days later the Soyuz 10 crew attempted to dock with it but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station The Soyuz 11 crew of Vladislav Volkov Georgi Dobrovolski and Viktor Patsayev successfully docked on June 7 and completed a then record 22day stay The crew became the second inflight space fatality during their reentry on June 30 when they were asphyxiated due to the spacecrafts cabin becoming depressurized shortly after undocking The disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve that allowed the air to vent into space The crew was not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred To prevent a recurrence of the Soyuz 11 tragedy Soviet engineers redesigned the Soyuz spacecraft and mandated that cosmonauts wear Sokol pressure suits during launch and landing a requirement still in place today The United States launched a single orbital workstation Skylab on May 14 1973 It was launched using a leftover Saturn5 rocket from the Apollo programme Skylab weighed 169950 pounds 77090 kg was 58 feet 18 m long by 217 feet 66 m in diameter and had a habitable volume of over 10000 cubic feet 280 m3 Skylab was damaged during the ascent to orbit losing one of its solar panels and a meteoroid thermal shield Subsequent crewed missions repaired the station and conducted valuable research The third and final missions crew Skylab 4 set a human endurance record at the time with 84 days in orbit when the mission ended on February 8 1974 Skylab stayed in orbit another five years before reentering the Earths atmosphere over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia on July 11 1979 Salyut 4 broke Skylabs occupation record at 92 days Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 were secondgeneration stations designed for long duration and were occupied for 683 and 816 days Salyut 7 improved upon earlier designs by allowing longduration crewed missions and more complex experiments These stations with their expanded crew capacity and amenities for long term stay carrying electric stoves a refrigerator and constant hot water Venus and Mars robotic landings Venus landings In 1970 the Soviet Unions Venera 7 marked the first time a spacecraft was able to return data after landing on another planet Venera 7 held a resistant thermometer and an aneroid barometer to measure the temperature and atmospheric pressure on the surface the transmitted data showed 475 C at the surface and a pressure of 92 bar In 1975 Venera 9 established an orbit around Venus and successfully returned the first photography of the surface of Venus Venera 10 landed on Venus and followed with further photography shortly after NASA initiated the Pioneer Venus project in 1978 successfully deploying four small probes into the Venusian atmosphere on December 9 1978 The probes confirmed that Venus has little if any magnetic field and cameras detected lightning in the atmosphere The last transmissions were received on October 8 1992 as its decaying orbit no longer permitted communications The spacecraft burned up the atmosphere soon after ending a successful 14year mission that was planned to last only eight months In 1981 Venera 13 performed a successful softlanding on Venus and marked the first probe to drill into the surface of another planet and take a sample Venera 13 also took an audio sample of the Venusian environment marking another first Venera 13 returned the first color images of the surface of Venus revealing an orangebrown flat bedrock surface covered with loose regolith and small flat thin angular rocks Venera 14 an identical spacecraft to Venera 13 was launched 5 days apart with a similar mission profile In total ten Venera probes achieved a soft landing on the surface of Venus In 1984 the Soviet Vega programme began and ended with the launch of two crafts launched six days apart Vega 1 and Vega 2 Both crafts deployed a balloon in addition to a lander marking a first in spaceflight The US never caught up or matched the Soviet efforts to explore the surface of Venus but did claim the title of the first successful probe to have flown by the planet and had notable success with the Pioneer atmospheric probes Mars landings In 1971 the Soviets Mars 2 successfully established Mars orbit and attempted a soft landing but crashed becoming the first manmade object to impact mars This was shortly followed by Mars 3 a 358 kg lander which successfully landed but the lander only transmitted data for 145 seconds before losing contact In 1976 NASA followed suit and put two successful landers on Mars These were Viking 1 and Viking 2 These landers were significantly larger than the Soviet Mars landers Viking 1 was 3527 kilograms They were able to take the first photographs from the surface of Mars Viking 1 operated on the surface of Mars for around six years On Nov 11 1982 the Lander stopped operating after getting a faulty command and Viking 2 for over three years mission ended in early 1980 Both landers were equipped with a robotic sampler arm which successfully scooped up soil samples and tested them with instruments such as a Gas chromatographymass spectrometer The landers measured temperatures ranging from negative 86 degrees Celsius before dawn to negative 33 degrees Celsius in the afternoon Both landers had issues obtaining accurate results from their seismometers Photographs from the landers and orbiters surpassed expectations in quality and quantity The total exceeded 4500 from the landers and 52000 from the orbiters The Viking landers recorded atmospheric pressures ranging from below 7 millibars 00068 bars to over 10 millibars 00108 bars over the Martian year leading to the conclusion that atmospheric pressure varies by 30 percent during the Martian year because carbon dioxide condenses and sublimes at the polar caps Martian winds generally blow more slowly than expected scientists had expected them to reach speeds of several hundred miles an hour from observing global dust storms but neither lander recorded gusts over 120 kilometers 74 miles an hour and average velocities were considerably lower Nevertheless the orbiters observed more than a dozen small dust storms The Viking landers detected nitrogen in the atmosphere for the first time and that it was a significant component of the Martian atmosphere There was speculation from the atmospheric analysis that the atmosphere of Mars used to be much denser The Soviets did not match the Martian lander achievements of NASA but did claim the title of the first lander ApolloSoyuz Test Project In May 1972 President Richard M Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev negotiated an easing of relations known as dtente creating a temporary thaw in the Cold War The two nations planned a joint mission to dock the last US Apollo craft with a Soyuz known as the ApolloSoyuz Test Project ASTP To prepare the US designed a docking module for the Apollo that was compatible with the Soviet docking system which allowed any of their craft to dock with any other eg SoyuztoSoyuz as well as SoyuztoSalyut The module was also necessary as an airlock to allow the men to visit each others craft which had incompatible cabin atmospheres The USSR used the Soyuz 16 mission in December 1974 to test modifications of the Soyuz atmosphere and the docking adapter to prepare for ASTP The joint mission began when Soyuz 19 was first launched on July 15 1975 at 1220 UTC and the Apollo craft was launched with the docking module six and a half hours later The two craft rendezvoused and docked on July 17 at 1619 UTC The three astronauts conducted joint experiments with the two cosmonauts and the crew shook hands exchanged gifts and visited each others craft Space Shuttles NASA achieved the first approach and landing test of its Space Shuttle orbiter on a Boeing 747 carrier plane on August 12 1977 and the first orbital test flight of a complete crewed Space Shuttle consisting of the orbiter an external fuel tank and two solid rocket boosters on April 12 1981 The designers underestimated the time and cost of refurbishment between flights which reduced the cost benefit of its reusability They also overestimated its safety two of the fleet of five orbiters were lost in fatal flight accidents one during launch due to failure of a solid rocket booster seal and one on reentry due to launch damage of a wing heat shield The Air Force was also supposed to use the Shuttle to launch its military payloads but shunned it in favor of its expendable launchers after the first Shuttle loss NASA ceased production of its Apollo spacecraft and Saturn IB launcher and used the Shuttle as its orbital workhorse until 2011 then retired it due to the safety concern Originally more than 150 flights over a 15year operation were expected actually the Shuttles made 135 flights in the 30year lifespan of the series The Soviets interpreted the Shuttle as a military surveillance vehicle and decided they had to develop their own shuttle which they named Buran beginning in 1974 They copied the aerodynamic design of NASAs Shuttle orbiter which they strapped to the side of their expendable liquid hydrogenfueled Energia launcher The Buran could be fitted with four Saturn AL31 turbofan engines and a fuel tank in its payload bay allowing it to make its own atmospheric test flights which began in November 1985 Also unlike the US Shuttle it could be flown pilotlessly and landed automatically EnergiaBuran made only one orbital test flight in November 1988 but US counterintelligence baited the Soviets with disinformation about the heat shield design and it was not reusable for repeated flight Buran was the largest and most expensive Soviet program in the history of the Space Race and was effectively canceled by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 due to lack of funding The Energia was also canceled at the same time after only two flights First women in space The first woman in space was from the Soviet Union Valentina Tereshkova NASA did not welcome female astronauts into its corps until 1978 when six female mission specialists were recruited This first class included scientist Sally Ride who became Americas first woman in space on STS7 in June 1983 NASA included women mission specialists in the next four astronaut candidate classes and admitted female pilots starting in 1990 Eileen Collins from this class became the first pilot to fly on Space Shuttle flight STS63 in February 1995 and the first female commander of a spaceflight on STS93 in July 1999 The USSR admitted its first female test pilot as a cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya in 1980 She became the first female to fly since Tereshkova on Salyut 7 in December 1981 First modular space station The USSR turned its space program to the development of the low Earth orbit modular space station Mir peace or world assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996 At 129700 kilograms 285900 lb it held records for the largest spacecraft and the longest continuous human presence in space at 3644 days until the International Space Station was built starting in 1998 Mirs operation continued after the 1991 replacement of the USSRs space program with the Russian Federal Space Agency until 2001 supported by Soyuz spacecraft Analysis and reception Who Won the Space Race The question of who won the Space Race has sparked considerable debate among historians and analysts The United States is widely seen as the victor due to the Apollo crewed landing and moonwalk missions which achieved President John F Kennedys ambitious goal of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s This achievement completed in July 1969 marked the pinnacle of US space exploration efforts of the time and was regarded by most observers as the culmination of the Space Race Political scientist Richard J Samuels describes Apollo 11 as a decisive American victory The Moon race is often analyzed as a microcosm of the Space Races broader dynamics historians such as Jennifer Frost argue that if the Space Race is measured in terms of overall spaceflight capability the Soviet Union won it hands down Asif A Siddiqi a noted space historian provides a more nuanced view emphasizing the Soviet Unions dominance in smaller aspects of the race to the moon yet critical benchmarks such as the first lunar impact first photos of the Moons far side first soft lunar landing and first lunar orbit These accomplishments laid the groundwork for lunar exploration though they are often overshadowed by the Apollo 11 missionBefore that landing Apollo 11 there was an enormous amount of investment in the robotic exploration of the Moon both by the Soviets and the US in terms of all sorts of smaller benchmarks like the first lunar impact the first pictures of the far side of the Moon the first soft lunar landing and the first lunar orbit We forget but in those little races the Soviet Union dominated almost every benchmark but it is forgotten as the United States won the big one Historians analysis The Space Race was deeply intertwined with Cold War rivalries and reflected broader ideological contests between the United States and the Soviet Union Walter McDougall highlights how space exploration served as a demonstration of each superpowers political and technological systems with the US emphasizing transparency and democratic values and the USSR showcasing the capabilities of its centralized statedriven model Asif A Siddiqi stresses the importance of viewing the Space Race as more than a singleevent competition He notes that while the US achieved the symbolic big one with the Apollo missions the Soviet Unions early and sustained achievements in robotic lunar and interplanetary exploration reveal the broader multifaceted nature of the rivalry These interpretations suggest that while the US achieved a definitive symbolic victory the competition was more complex than often acknowledged Public reception The Space Race captivated global audiences and became a cultural symbol of human ingenuity United States Kennedys challenge galvanized public support and the Apollo program became a unifying force Apollo 11 watched by an estimated 600 million people globally remains a defining moment in US history However public enthusiasm waned to some extent as priorities shifted in the postMoon landing era Global Perspective International audiences often viewed the Space Race as a testament to human progress rather than a purely geopolitical contest It inspired space programs worldwide particularly in Europe Japan and India Legacy After the end of the Cold War in 1991 the assets of the USSRs space program passed mainly to Russia Since then the United States and Russia have cooperated in space with the ShuttleMir Program and the International Space Station ISS The Russians continue to use their R7 rocket family as their orbital workhorse to launch the Soyuz crewed spacecraft and its Progress derivative uncrewed cargo craft as shuttles to the ISS After the 2011 retirement of the Space Shuttle American crews were dependent on the R7Soyuz to reach the ISS until the 2020 first flight of the US Crew Dragon Commercial Crew Development vehicle In 2023 the Russian Federation resumed the Luna missions as a part of the LunaGlob programme with the launch of Luna 25 47 years after the Soviet Luna 24 amidst American reignition of interest in the Moon with the

    title: "Consciousness",
    originalContent:
      "Consciousness at its simplest is awareness of internal and external existence However its nature has led to millennia of analyses explanations and debate by philosophers scientists and theologians Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness In some explanations it is synonymous with the mind and at other times an aspect of it In the past it was ones inner life the world of introspection of private thought imagination and volition Today it often includes any kind of cognition experience feeling or perception It may be awareness awareness of awareness metacognition or selfawareness either continuously changing or not The disparate range of research notions and speculations raises a curiosity about whether the right questions are being asked Examples of the range of descriptions definitions or explanations are ordered distinction between self and environment simple wakefulness ones sense of selfhood or soul explored by looking within being a metaphorical stream of contents or being a mental state mental event or mental process of the brain Etymology The words conscious and consciousness in the English language date to the 17th century and the first recorded use of conscious as a simple adjective was applied figuratively to inanimate objects the conscious Groves 1643 175 It derived from the Latin conscius con together and scio to know which meant knowing with or having joint or common knowledge with another especially as in sharing a secret Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan 1651 wrote Where two or more men know of one and the same fact they are said to be Conscious of it one to another There were also many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi which translates literally as knowing with oneself or in other words sharing knowledge with oneself about something This phrase has the figurative sense of knowing that one knows which is something like the modern English word conscious but it was rendered into English as conscious to oneself or conscious unto oneself For example Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness The Latin conscientia literally knowledgewith first appears in Roman juridical texts by writers such as Cicero It means a kind of shared knowledge with moral value specifically what a witness knows of someone elses deeds Although Ren Descartes 15961650 writing in Latin is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use conscientia in a way less like the traditional meaning and more like the way modern English speakers would use conscience his meaning is nowhere defined In Search after Truth Regul ad directionem ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale Amsterdam 1701 he wrote the word with a gloss conscienti vel interno testimonio translatable as conscience or internal testimony It might mean the knowledge of the value of ones own thoughts The origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to John Locke who defined the word in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding published in 1690 as the perception of what passes in a mans own mind The essay strongly influenced 18thcentury British philosophy and Lockes definition appeared in Samuel Johnsons celebrated Dictionary 1755 The French term conscience is defined roughly like English consciousness in the 1753 volume of Diderot and dAlemberts Encyclopdie as the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have from what we do Problem of definition Scholars are divided as to whether Aristotle had a concept of consciousness He does not use any single word or terminology that is clearly similar to the phenomenon or concept defined by John Locke Victor Caston contends that Aristotle did have a concept more clearly similar to perception Modern dictionary definitions of the word consciousness evolved over several centuries and reflect a range of seemingly related meanings with some differences that have been controversial such as the distinction between inward awareness and perception of the physical world or the distinction between conscious and unconscious or the notion of a mental entity or mental activity that is not physical The commonusage definitions of consciousness in Websters Third New International Dictionary 1966 are as follows awareness awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact intuitively perceived knowledge of something in ones inner self inward awareness of an external object state or fact concerned awareness INTEREST CONCERNoften used with an attributive noun eg class consciousness the state or activity that is characterized by sensation emotion volition or thought mind in the broadest possible sense something in nature that is distinguished from the physical the totality in psychology of sensations perceptions ideas attitudes and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time spancompare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS waking life as that to which one returns after sleep trance fever wherein all ones mental powers have returned the part of mental life or psychic content in psychoanalysis that is immediately available to the egocompare PRECONSCIOUS UNCONSCIOUS The Cambridge English Dictionary defines consciousness as the state of understanding and realizing something The Oxford Living Dictionary defines consciousness as the state of being aware of and responsive to ones surroundings a persons awareness or perception of something and the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world Philosophers have attempted to clarify technical distinctions by using a jargon of their own The corresponding entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy 1998 reads Consciousness Philosophers have used the term consciousness for four main topics knowledge in general intentionality introspection and the knowledge it specifically generates and phenomenal experience Something within ones mind is introspectively conscious just in case one introspects it or is poised to do so Introspection is often thought to deliver ones primary knowledge of ones mental life An experience or other mental entity is phenomenally conscious just in case there is something it is like for one to have it The clearest examples are perceptual experience such as tastings and seeings bodilysensational experiences such as those of pains tickles and itches imaginative experiences such as those of ones own actions or perceptions and streams of thought as in the experience of thinking in words or in images Introspection and phenomenality seem independent or dissociable although this is controversial Traditional metaphors for mind During the early 19th century the emerging field of geology inspired a popular metaphor that the mind likewise had hidden layers which recorded the past of the individual 3 By 1875 most psychologists believed that consciousness was but a small part of mental life 3 and this idea underlies the goal of Freudian therapy to expose the unconscious layer of the mind Other metaphors from various sciences inspired other analyses of the mind for example Johann Friedrich Herbart described ideas as being attracted and repulsed like magnets John Stuart Mill developed the idea of mental chemistry and mental compounds and Edward B Titchener sought the structure of the mind by analyzing its elements The abstract idea of states of consciousness mirrored the concept of states of matter In 1892 William James noted that the ambiguous word content has been recently invented instead of object and that the metaphor of mind as a container seemed to minimize the dualistic problem of how states of consciousness can know things or objects 465 by 1899 psychologists were busily studying the contents of conscious experience by introspection and experiment 365 Another popular metaphor was Jamess doctrine of the stream of consciousness with continuity fringes and transitions vii James discussed the difficulties of describing and studying psychological phenomena recognizing that commonlyused terminology was a necessary and acceptable starting point towards more precise scientifically justified language Prime examples were phrases like inner experience and personal consciousness The first and foremost concrete fact which every one will affirm to belong to his inner experience is the fact that consciousness of some sort goes on States of mind succeed each other in him But everyone knows what the terms mean only in a rough way When I say every state or thought is part of a personal consciousness personal consciousness is one of the terms in question Its meaning we know so long as no one asks us to define it but to give an accurate account of it is the most difficult of philosophic tasks The only states of consciousness that we naturally deal with are found in personal consciousnesses minds selves concrete particular Is and yous 152153 From introspection to awareness Prior to the 20th century philosophers treated the phenomenon of consciousness as the inner world of ones own mind and introspection was the mind attending to itself an activity seemingly distinct from that of perceiving the outer world and its physical phenomena In 1892 William James noted the distinction along with doubts about the inward character of the mindThings have been doubted but thoughts and feelings have never been doubted The outer world but never the inner world has been denied Everyone assumes that we have direct introspective acquaintance with our thinking activity as such with our consciousness as something inward and contrasted with the outer objects which it knows Yet I must confess that for my part I cannot feel sure of this conclusion It seems as if consciousness as an inner activity were rather a postulate than a sensibly given fact 467 By the 1960s for many philosophers and psychologists who talked about consciousness the word no longer meant the inner world but an indefinite large category called awareness as in the following example It is difficult for modern Western man to grasp that the Greeks really had no concept of consciousness in that they did not class together phenomena as varied as problem solving remembering imagining perceiving feeling pain dreaming and acting on the grounds that all these are manifestations of being aware or being conscious 4 Many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness In The Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology 1989 edition Stuart Sutherland emphasized external awareness and expressed a skeptical attitude more than a definition ConsciousnessThe having of perceptions thoughts and feelings awareness The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with selfconsciousnessto be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon it is impossible to specify what it is what it does or why it has evolved Nothing worth reading has been written on it Using awareness however as a definition or synonym of consciousness is not a simple matter If awareness of the environment is the criterion of consciousness then even the protozoans are conscious If awareness of awareness is required then it is doubtful whether the great apes and human infants are conscious Influence on research Many philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood by the majority of people despite the difficulty philosophers have had defining it Max Velmans proposed that the everyday understanding of consciousness uncontroversially refers to experience itself rather than any particular thing that we observe or experience and he added that consciousness is therefore exemplified by all the things that we observe or experience 4 whether thoughts feelings or perceptions Velmans noted however as of 2009 that there was a deep level of confusion and internal division among experts about the phenomenon of consciousness because researchers lacked a sufficiently wellspecified use of the termto agree that they are investigating the same thing 3 He argued additionally that preexisting theoretical commitments to competing explanations of consciousness might be a source of bias Within the modern consciousness studies community the technical phrase phenomenal consciousness is a common synonym for all forms of awareness or simply experience 4 without differentiating between inner and outer or between higher and lower types With advances in brain research the presence or absence of experienced phenomena 3 of any kind underlies the work of those neuroscientists who seek to analyze the precise relation of conscious phenomenology to its associated information processing in the brain 10 This neuroscientific goal is to find the neural correlates of consciousness NCC One criticism of this goal is that it begins with a theoretical commitment to the neurological origin of all experienced phenomena whether inner or outer Also the fact that the easiest content of consciousness to be so analyzed is the experienced threedimensional world the phenomenal world beyond the body surface 4 invites another criticism that most consciousness research since the 1990s perhaps because of bias has focused on processes of external perception From a history of psychology perspective Julian Jaynes rejected popular but superficial views of consciousness 447 especially those which equate it with that vaguest of terms experience 8 In 1976 he insisted that if not for introspection which for decades had been ignored or taken for granted rather than explained there could be no conception of what consciousness is 18 and in 1990 he reaffirmed the traditional idea of the phenomenon called consciousness writing that its denotative definition is as it was for Descartes Locke and Hume what is introspectable 450 Jaynes saw consciousness as an important but small part of human mentality and he asserted there can be no progress in the science of consciousness until what is introspectable is sharply distinguished 447 from the unconscious processes of cognition such as perception reactive awareness and attention and automatic forms of learning problemsolving and decisionmaking 2147 The cognitive science point of viewwith an interdisciplinary perspective involving fields such as psychology linguistics and anthropologyrequires no agreed definition of consciousness but studies the interaction of many processes besides perception For some researchers consciousness is linked to some kind of selfhood for example to certain pragmatic issues such as the feeling of agency and the effects of regret and action on experience of ones own body or social identity Similarly Daniel Kahneman who focused on systematic errors in perception memory and decisionmaking has differentiated between two kinds of mental processes or cognitive systems the fast activities that are primary automatic and cannot be turned off 22 and the slow deliberate effortful activities of a secondary system often associated with the subjective experience of agency choice and concentration 13 Kahnemans two systems have been described as roughly corresponding to unconscious and conscious processes 8 The two systems can interact for example in sharing the control of attention 22 While System 1 can be impulsive System 2 is in charge of selfcontrol 26 and When we think of ourselves we identify with System 2 the conscious reasoning self that has beliefs makes choices and decides what to think about and what to do 21 Some have argued that we should eliminate the concept from our understanding of the mind a position known as consciousness semanticism In medicine a level of consciousness terminology is used to describe a patients arousal and responsiveness which can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension through disorientation delirium loss of meaningful communication and finally loss of movement in response to painful stimuli Issues of practical concern include how the level of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill comatose or anesthetized people and how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted The degree or level of consciousness is measured by standardized behavior observation scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale Philosophy of mind While historically philosophers have defended various views on consciousness surveys indicate that physicalism is now the dominant position among contemporary philosophers of mind For an overview of the field approaches often include both historical perspectives eg Descartes Locke Kant and organization by key issues in contemporary debates An alternative is to focus primarily on current philosophical stances and empirical findings Coherence of the concept Philosophers differ from nonphilosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness skeptics argue that this intuition is too narrow either because the concept of consciousness is embedded in our intuitions or because we all are illusions Gilbert Ryle for example argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body or between mind and world He proposed that we speak not of minds bodies and the world but of entities or identities acting in the world Thus by speaking of consciousness we end up leading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings Types Ned Block argued that discussions on consciousness often failed to properly distinguish phenomenal Pconsciousness from access Aconsciousness though these terms had been used before Block Pconsciousness according to Block is raw experience it is moving colored forms sounds sensations emotions and feelings with our bodies and responses at the center These experiences considered independently of any impact on behavior are called qualia Aconsciousness on the other hand is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report reasoning and the control of behavior So when we perceive information about what we perceive is access conscious when we introspect information about our thoughts is access conscious when we remember information about the past is access conscious and so on Although some philosophers such as Daniel Dennett have disputed the validity of this distinction others have broadly accepted it David Chalmers has argued that Aconsciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms but that understanding Pconsciousness is much more challenging he calls this the hard problem of consciousness Some philosophers believe that Blocks two types of consciousness are not the end of the story William Lycan for example argued in his book Consciousness and Experience that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified organism consciousness control consciousness consciousness of stateevent consciousness reportability introspective consciousness subjective consciousness selfconsciousnessand that even this list omits several more obscure forms There is also debate over whether or not Aconsciousness and Pconsciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately Although Pconsciousness without Aconsciousness is more widely accepted there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P Block for instance suggests the case of a zombie that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity However he remains somewhat skeptical concluding I dont know whether there are any actual cases of Aconsciousness without Pconsciousness but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility Distinguishing consciousness from its contents Sam Harris observes At the level of your experience you are not a body of cells organelles and atoms you are consciousness and its everchanging contents Seen in this way consciousness is a subjectively experienced everpresent field in which things the contents of consciousness come and go Christopher Tricker argues that this field of consciousness is symbolized by the mythical bird that opens the Daoist classic the Zhuangzi This birds name is Of a Flock peng yet its back is countless thousands of miles across and its wings are like clouds arcing across the heavens Like Of a Flock whose wings arc across the heavens the wings of your consciousness span to the horizon At the same time the wings of every other beings consciousness span to the horizon You are of a flock one bird among kin Mindbody problem Mental processes such as consciousness and physical processes such as brain events seem to be correlated however the specific nature of the connection is unknown The first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was Descartes and the answer he gave is known as mindbody dualism Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called res cogitans the realm of thought in contrast to the domain of material things which he called res extensa the realm of extension He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain perhaps in a small midline structure called the pineal gland Although it is widely accepted that Descartes explained the problem cogently few later philosophers have been happy with his solution and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed However no alternative solution has gained general acceptance Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories dualist solutions that maintain Descartess rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other and monist solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being of which consciousness and matter are both aspects Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants The two main types of dualism are substance dualism which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics and property dualism which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind The three main types of monism are physicalism which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way idealism which holds that only thought or experience truly exists and matter is merely an illusion and neutral monism which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them There are also however a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought Since the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was Julien Offray de La Mettrie in his book Man a Machine Lhomme machine His arguments however were very abstract The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as Gerald Edelman and Antonio Damasio and by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain Many other neuroscientists such as Christof Koch have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame allencompassing global theories At the same time computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody consciousness A few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind QM theories of consciousness Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm and the OrchOR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness None of the quantum mechanical theories have been confirmed by experiment Recent publications by G Guerreshi J Cia S Popescu and H Briegel could falsify proposals such as those of Hameroff which rely on quantum entanglement in protein At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing Empirical evidence is against the notion of quantum consciousness an experiment about wave function collapse led by Catalina Curceanu in 2022 suggests that quantum consciousness as suggested by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff is highly implausible Apart from the general question of the hard problem of consciousness which is roughly speaking the question of how mental experience can arise from a physical basis a more specialized question is how to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions at least in some small measure with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events The topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum Problem of other minds Many philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside subjectively The problem of other minds is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following epistemological question Given that I can only observe the behavior of others how can I know that others have minds The problem of other minds is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies that is people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois and by Colin Allen a professor at the University of Pittsburgh regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids The most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior we reason that if they look like us and act like us they must be like us in other ways including having experiences of the sort that we do There are however a variety of problems with that explanation For one thing it seems to violate the principle of parsimony by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe Some philosophers such as Daniel Dennett in a research paper titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying More broadly philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior including verbal behavior and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences Qualia The term qualia was introduced in philosophical literature by C I Lewis The word is derived from Latin and means of what sort It is basically a quantity or property of something as perceived or experienced by an individual like the scent of rose the taste of wine or the pain of a headache They are difficult to articulate or describe The philosopher and scientist Daniel Dennett describes them as the way things seem to us while philosopher and cognitive scientist David Chalmers expanded on qualia as the hard problem of consciousness in the 1990s When qualia is experienced activity is simulated in the brain and these processes are called neural correlates of consciousness NCCs Many scientific studies have been done to attempt to link particular brain regions with emotions or experiences Species which experience qualia are said to have sentience which is central to the animal rights movement because it includes the ability to experience pain and suffering Scientific study For many decades consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the majority of mainstream scientists because of a general feeling that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied using objective experimental methods In 1975 George Mandler published an influential psychological study which distinguished between slow serial and limited conscious processes and fast parallel and extensive unconscious ones The Science and Religion Forum 1984 annual conference From Artificial Intelligence to Human Consciousness identified the nature of consciousness as a matter for investigation Donald Michie was a keynote speaker Starting in the 1980s an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called Consciousness Studies giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books journals such as Consciousness and Cognition Frontiers in Consciousness Research Psyche and the Journal of Consciousness Studies along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness and the Society for Consciousness Studies Modern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are based on psychological experiments including for example the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli and on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma illness or drugs Broadly viewed scientific approaches are based on two core concepts The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired In either case the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it Measurement via verbal report Experimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties due to the lack of a universally accepted operational definition In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness the subjects are human and the criterion used is verbal report in other words subjects are asked to describe their experiences and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness For example subjects who stare continuously at a Necker cube usually report that they experience it flipping between two 3D configurations even though the stimulus itself remains the same The objective is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of stimuli as indicated by verbal report and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior In several paradigms such as the technique of response priming the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification double dissociation Verbal report is widely considered to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness but it raises a number of issues For one thing if verbal reports are treated as observations akin to observations in other branches of science then the possibility arises that they may contain errorsbut it is difficult to make sense of the idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species prelinguistic children or people with types of brain damage that impair language As a third issue philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is possible at least in principle for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness Although verbal report is in practice the gold standard for ascribing consciousness it is not the only possible criterion In medicine consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior arousal brain activity and purposeful movement The last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent The scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed however due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness Studies related to the neuroscience of free will have also shown that the influence consciousness has on decisionmaking is not always straightforward Mirror test and contingency awareness Another approach applies specifically to the study of selfawareness that is the ability to distinguish oneself from others In the 1970s Gordon Gallup developed an operational test for selfawareness known as the mirror test The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals The classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individuals forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves Humans older than 18 months and other great apes bottlenose dolphins orcas pigeons European magpies and elephants have all been observed to pass this test While some other animals like pigs have been shown to find food by looking into the mirror Contingency awareness is another such approach which is basically the conscious understanding of ones actions and its effects on ones environment It is recognized as a factor in selfrecognition The brain processes during contingency awareness and learning is believed to rely on an intact medial temporal lobe and age A study done in 2020 involving transcranial direct current stimulation Magnetic resonance imaging MRI and eyeblink classical conditioning supported the idea that the parietal cortex serves as a substrate for contingency awareness and that agerelated disruption of this region is sufficient to impair awareness Neural correlates A major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brainsthat is studies of the neural correlates of consciousness The hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain or a particular pattern of global brain activity which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness Several brain imaging techniques such as EEG and fMRI have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies Another idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that consciousness is associated with highfrequency gamma band oscillations in brain activity This idea arose from proposals in the 1980s by Christof von der Malsburg and Wolf Singer that gamma oscillations could solve the socalled binding problem by linking information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified experience Rodolfo Llins for example proposed that consciousness results from recurrent thalamocortical resonance where the specific thalamocortical systems content and the nonspecific centromedial thalamus thalamocortical systems context interact in the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations A number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex V1 show clear electrical responses to a stimulus Higher brain areas are seen as more promising especially the prefrontal cortex which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions There is substantial evidence that a topdown flow of neural activity ie activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas is more predictive of conscious awareness than a bottomup flow of activity The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area however studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown for example that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes ie bistable percepts during binocular rivalry Furthermore topdown feedback from higher to lower visual brain areas may be weaker or absent in the peripheral visual field as suggested by some experimental data and theoretical arguments nevertheless humans can perceive visual inputs in the peripheral visual field arising from bottomup V1 neural activities Meanwhile bottomup V1 activities for the central visual fields can be vetoed and thus made invisible to perception by the topdown feedback when these bottomup signals are inconsistent with the brains internal model of the visual world Modulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal experiences In contrast to the raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an important aspect of consciousness namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity brightness contrast In the research group of Danko Nikoli it has been shown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas This indicates that in the primary visual areas changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualiaat least for some type of qualia In 2013 the perturbational complexity index PCI was proposed a measure of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake in REM sleep or in a lockedin state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states Assuming that not only humans but even some nonmammalian species are conscious a number of evolutionary approaches to the problem of neural correlates of consciousness open up For example assuming that birds are consciousa common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birdsthere are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal currently competing mammalian consciousnessbrain theories The rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain So how similar are they What homologs can be identified The general conclusion from the study by Butler et al is that some of the major theories for the mammalian brain also appear to be valid for the avian brain The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch Edelman and Tononi and Cotterill seem to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness which is a trait shared by humans and nonhuman animals and higherorder consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity Certain aspects of the three theories however seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness For instance the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role seems difficult to apply to the avian brain since the avian homologs have a different morphology Likewise the theory of Eccles seems incompatible since a structural homologanalogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus The reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists Joaquin Fuster of UCLA has advocated the position of the importance of the prefrontal cortex in humans along with the areas of Wernicke and Broca as being of particular importance to the development of human language capacities neuroanatomically necessary for the emergence of higherorder consciousness in humans A study in 2016 looked at lesions in specific areas of the brainstem that were associated with coma and vegetative states A small region of the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum in the brainstem was suggested to drive consciousness through functional connectivity with two cortical regions the left ventral anterior insular cortex and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex These three regions may work together as a triad to maintain consciousness Models A wide range of empirical theories of consciousness have been proposed Adrian Doerig and colleagues list 13 notable theories while Anil Seth and Tim Bayne list 22 notable theories Global workspace theory Global workspace theory GWT is a cognitive architecture and theory of consciousness proposed by the cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars in 1988 Baars explains the theory with the metaphor of a theater with conscious processes represented by an illuminated stage This theater integrates inputs from a variety of unconscious and otherwise autonomous networks in the brain and then broadcasts them to unconscious networks represented in the metaphor by a broad unlit audience The theory has since been expanded upon by other scientists including cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene and Lionel Naccache Integrated information theory Integrated information theory IIT pioneered by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi in 2004 postulates that consciousness resides in the information being processed and arises once the information reaches a certain level of complexity Additionally IIT is one of the only leading theories of consciousness that attempts to create a 11 mapping between conscious states and precise formal mathematical descriptions of those mental states Proponents of this model suggest that it may provide a physical grounding for consciousness in neurons as they provide the mechanism by which information is integrated This also relates to the hard problem of consciousness proposed by David Chalmers The theory remains controversial because of its lack of credibility Orchestrated objective reduction Orchestrated objective reduction OrchOR or the quantum theory of mind was proposed by scientists Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff and states that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules which form the cytoskeleton around which the brain is built The duo proposed that these quantum processes accounted for creativity innovation and problemsolving abilities Penrose published his views in the book The Emperors New Mind In 2014 the discovery of quantum vibrations inside microtubules gave new life to the argument Attention schema theory In 2011 Graziano and Kastner proposed the attention schema theory of awareness In that theory specific cortical areas notably in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporoparietal junction are used to build the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people The same cortical machinery is also used to attribute awareness to oneself Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as hemispatial neglect In the attention schema theory the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that persons attentional processing Attention is a style of information processing in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals Awareness in this theory is a useful simplified schema that represents attentional states To be aware of X is explained by constructing a model of ones attentional focus on X Entropic brain theory The entropic brain is a theory of conscious states informed by neuroimaging research with psychedelic drugs The theory suggests that the brain in primary states such as rapid eye movement REM sleep early psychosis and under the influence of psychedelic drugs is in a disordered state normal waking consciousness constrains some of this freedom and makes possible metacognitive functions such as internal selfadministered reality testing and selfawareness Criticism has included questioning whether the theory has been adequately tested Projective consciousness model In 2017 work by David Rudrauf and colleagues including Karl Friston applied the active inference paradigm to consciousness leading to the projective consciousness model PCM a model of how sensory data is integrated with priors in a process of projective transformation The authors argue that while their model identifies a key relationship between computation and phenomenology it does not completely solve the hard problem of consciousness or completely close the explanatory gap Claustrum being the conductor for consciousness In 2004 a proposal was made by molecular biologist Francis Crick codiscoverer of the double helix which stated that to bind together an individuals experience a conductor of an orchestra is required Together with neuroscientist Christof Koch he proposed that this conductor would have to collate information rapidly from various regions of the brain The duo reckoned that the claustrum was well suited for the task However Crick died while working on the idea The proposal is backed by a study done in 2014 where a team at the George Washington University induced unconsciousness in a 54yearold woman suffering from intractable epilepsy by simulating her claustrum The woman underwent depth electrode implantation and electrical stimulation mapping The electrode between the left claustrum and anteriordorsal insula was the one which induced unconsciousness Correlation for interactions affecting medial parietal and posterior frontal channels during stimulation increased significantly as well Their findings suggested that the left claustrum or anterior insula is an important part of a network that subserves consciousness and that disruption of consciousness is related to increased EEG signal synchrony within frontalparietal networks However this remains an isolated hence inconclusive study Biological function and evolution The emergence of consciousness during biological evolution remains a topic of ongoing scientific inquiry The survival value of consciousness is still a matter of exploration and understanding While consciousness appears to play a crucial role in human cognition decisionmaking and selfawareness its adaptive significance across different species remains a subject of debate Some people question whether consciousness has any survival value Some argue that consciousness is a byproduct of evolution Thomas Henry Huxley for example defends in an essay titled On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata and its History an epiphenomenalist theory of consciousness according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activityas the steamwhistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata by stating an evolutionary argument for mindbrain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes but has had a survival value itself and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious Karl Popper develops a similar evolutionary argument in the book The Self and Its Brain Opinions are divided on when and how consciousness first arose It has been argued that consciousness emerged i exclusively with the first humans ii exclusively with the first mammals iii independently in mammals and birds or iv with the first reptiles Other authors date the origins of consciousness to the first animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the Cambrian over 500 million years ago Donald Griffin suggests in his book Animal Minds a gradual evolution of consciousness Further exploration of the origins of consciousness particularly in molluscs has been done by Peter Godfrey Smith in his book Metazoa Regarding the primary function of conscious processing a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and informationprocessing that would otherwise be independent This has been called the integration consensus Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higherorder consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with nonhuman animals see Neural correlates section above These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness differentiation and unity They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details differentiation because it integrates those details from our sensory systems while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts However it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness Not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously eg neural activity related to vegetative functions reflexes unconscious motor programs lowlevel perceptual analyzes etc and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations see the article of Ezequiel Morsella As noted earlier even among writers who consider consciousness to be welldefined there is widespread dispute about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higherorder consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with nonhuman animals see previous paragraph Thus any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties Nevertheless some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the sense of a trait that increases fitness In his article Evolution of consciousness John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness a psychon linked to a dendron through quantum physics Bernard Baars proposed that once in place this recursive circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them eg that water in the distance may be a mirage and behave accordingly and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends Other philosophers however have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes No one has given a causal explanation they argue of why it would not be possible for a functionally equivalent nonconscious organism ie a philosophical zombie to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function F being performed by conscious organism O and nonconscious organism O it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide As a result an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina but instead just a byproduct of the way the retinal axons were wired Several scholars including Pinker Chomsky Edelman and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higherorder consciousness see Neural correlates section above Altered states There are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent including dreamless sleep or coma There are also a variety of circumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the world in less drastic ways producing what are known as altered states of consciousness Some altered states occur naturally others can be produced by drugs or brain damage Altered states can be accompanied by changes in thinking disturbances in the sense of time feelings of loss of control changes in emotional expression alternations in body image and changes in meaning or significance The two most widely accepted altered states are sleep and dreaming Although dream sleep and nondream sleep appear very similar to an outside observer each is associated with a distinct pattern of brain activity metabolic activity and eye movement each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition During ordinary nondream sleep people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy thoughts and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous narrative During dream sleep in contrast people who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous progression which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions Thought processes during the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality Both dream and nondream states are associated with severe disruption of memory it usually disappears in seconds during the nondream state and in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed Research conducted on the effects of partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who have partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness In partial epileptic seizures consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness often automated behaviors remain intact Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention A variety of psychoactive drugs including alcohol have notable effects on consciousness These range from a simple dulling of awareness produced by sedatives to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants cannabis empathogensentactogens such as MDMA Ecstasy or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics LSD mescaline psilocybin dimethyltryptamine and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception including hallucinations some users even describe their druginduced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role There has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and people who practise various techniques of meditation Some research with brain waves during meditation has reported differences between those corresponding to ordinary relaxation and those corresponding to meditation It has been disputed however whether there is enough evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of consciousness The most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist Charles Tart in the 1960s and 1970s Tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of component processes including exteroception sensing the external world interoception sensing the body inputprocessing seeing meaning emotions memory time sense sense of identity evaluation and cognitive processing motor output and interaction with the environment Each of these in his view could be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations The components that Tart identified have not however been validated by empirical studies Research in this area has not yet reached firm conclusions but a recent questionnairebased study identified eleven significant factors contributing to druginduced states of consciousness experience of unity spiritual experience blissful state insightfulness disembodiment impaired control and cognition anxiety complex imagery elementary imagery audiovisual synesthesia and changed meaning of percepts Medical aspects The medical approach to consciousness is scientifically oriented It derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease brain damage toxins or drugs In medicine conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments The medical approach focuses mostly on the amount of consciousness a person has in medicine consciousness is assessed as a level ranging from coma and brain death at the low end to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end Consciousness is of concern to patients and physicians especially neurologists and anesthesiologists Patients may have disorders of consciousness or may need to be anesthetized for a surgical procedure Physicians may perform consciousnessrelated interventions such as instructing the patient to sleep administering general anesthesia or inducing medical coma Also bioethicists may be concerned with the ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients such as the Karen Ann Quinlan case while neuroscientists may study patients with impaired consciousness in hopes of gaining information about how the brain works Assessment In medicine consciousness is examined using a set of procedures known as neuropsychological assessment There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient a simple procedure that requires minimal training and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli If so the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands If so the patient is asked for name current location and current day and time A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be alert and oriented times four sometimes denoted AOx4 on a medical chart and is usually considered fully conscious The more complex procedure is known as a neurological examination and is usually carried out by a neurologist in a hospital setting A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language The outcome may be summarized using the Glasgow Coma Scale which yields a number in the range 315 with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma and 15 indicating full consciousness The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales measuring the best motor response ranging from no motor response to obeys commands the best eye response ranging from no eye opening to eyes opening spontaneously and the best verbal response ranging from no verbal response to fully oriented There is also a simpler pediatric version of the scale for children too young to be able to use language In 2013 an experimental procedure was developed to measure degrees of consciousness the procedure involving stimulating the brain with a magnetic pulse measuring resulting waves of electrical activity and developing a consciousness score based on the complexity of the brain activity Disorders Medical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state but sometimes also includes the less severe lockedin syndrome and more severe chronic coma Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research Finally brain death results in possible irreversible disruption of consciousness While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration eg dementia and delirium or transient interruption eg grand mal and petit mal seizures of consciousness they are not included in this category Medical experts increasingly view anosognosia as a disorder of consciousness Anosognosia is a Greekderived term meaning unawareness of disease This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way most commonly as a result of a stroke but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the left side of the body but sometimes deny being unable to move When questioned about the obvious problem the patient may avoid giving a direct answer or may give an explanation that does not make sense Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in and when asked what he was doing complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him An even more striking type of anosognosia is AntonBabinski syndrome a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary Outside human adults In children Of the eight types of consciousness in the Lycan classification some are detectable in utero and others develop years after birth Psychologist and educator William Foulkes studied childrens dreams and concluded that prior to the shift in cognitive maturation that humans experience during ages five to seven children lack the Lockean consciousness that Lycan had labeled introspective consciousness and that Foulkes labels selfreflection In a 2020 paper Katherine Nelson and Robyn Fivush use autobiographical consciousness to label essentially the same faculty and agree with Foulkes on the timing of this facultys acquisition Nelson and Fivush contend that language is the tool by which humans create a new uniquely human form of consciousness namely autobiographical consciousness Julian Jaynes had staked out these positions decades earlier Citing the developmental steps that lead the infant to autobiographical consciousness Nelson and Fivush point to the acquisition of theory of mind calling theory of mind necessary for autobiographical consciousness and defining it as understanding differences between ones own mind and others minds in terms of beliefs desires emotions and thoughts They write The hallmark of theory of mind the understanding of false belief occurs at five to six years of age In animals The topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form because nonhuman animals lacking the ability to express human language cannot tell humans about their experiences Also it is difficult to reason objectively about the question because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel its life has no value and that harming it is not morally wrong Descartes for example has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals due to the fact that he believed only humans have a nonphysical mind Most people have a strong intuition that some animals such as cats and dogs are conscious while others such as insects are not but the sources of this intuition are not obvious and are often based on personal interactions with pets and other animals they have observed Philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe as a correlate that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known Thomas Nagel spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled What Is it Like to Be a Bat He said that an organism is conscious if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organismsomething it is like for the organism and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animals brain and behavior we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself Other thinkers such as Douglas Hofstadter dismiss this argument as incoherent Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceiveDonald Griffins 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence On July 7 2012 eminent scientists from different branches of neuroscience gathered at the University of Cambridge to celebrate the Francis Crick Memorial Conference which deals with consciousness in humans and prelinguistic consciousness in nonhuman animals After the conference they signed in the presence of Stephen Hawking the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness which summarizes the most important findings of the survey We decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to the public that is not scientific Its obvious to everyone in this room that animals have consciousness but it is not obvious to the rest of the world It is not obvious to the rest of the Western world or the Far East It is not obvious to the society Convergent evidence indicates that nonhuman animals including all mammals and birds and other creatures have the necessary neural substrates of consciousness and the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors In artificial intelligence The idea of an artifact made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology appearing for example in the Greek myth of Pygmalion who carved a statue that was magically brought to life and in medieval Jewish stories of the Golem a magically animated homunculus built of clay However the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by Ada Lovelace in a set of notes written in 1842 about the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage a precursor never built to modern electronic computers Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could think in a humanlike way She wrote It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform It can follow analysis but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with One of the most influential contributions to this question was an essay written in 1950 by pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence Turing disavowed any interest in terminology saying that even Can machines think is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test which has become known as the Turing test To pass the test a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections and presented a counterargument to each of them The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of artificial intelligence as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate For example Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious while David Chalmers argues that a philosophical zombie could pass the test yet fail to be conscious A third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once machines begin to display any substantial signs of humanlike behavior then the dichotomy of human consciousness compared to humanlike consciousness becomes pass and issues of machine autonomy begin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology Jrgen Schmidhuber argues that consciousness is the result of compression As an agent sees representation of itself recurring in the environment the compression of this representation can be called consciousness In a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as the Chinese room argument John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls strong artificial intelligence AI that a computer program can be conscious though he does agree with advocates of weak AI that computer programs can be formatted to simulate conscious states His own view is that consciousness has subjective firstperson causal powers by being essentially intentional due to the way human brains function biologically conscious persons can perform computations but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker Searle himself in fact a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input and boxes filled with Chinese symbols In this case the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program Searle argues that with such a machine he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean If the experiment were done in English since Searle knows English he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped In the literature concerning artificial intelligence Searles essay has been second only to Turings in the volume of debate it has generated Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients it would take to make a machine conscious all he proposed was that what was needed was causal powers of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary though perhaps still not sufficient extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test but the robotic version which requires grounding the robots words in the robots sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that its words are about Turingindistinguishably from a real person Turingscale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition In 2014 Victor Argonov has suggested a nonTuring test for machine consciousness based on a machines ability to produce philosophical judgments He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness such as qualia or binding having no innate preloaded philosophical knowledge on these issues no philosophical discussions while learning and no informational models of other creatures in its memory such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures consciousness However this test can be used only to detect but not refute the existence of consciousness A positive result proves that a machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing For example absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machines intellect not by absence of consciousness Stream of consciousness William James is usually credited with popularizing the idea that human consciousness flows like a stream in his Principles of Psychology of 1890 According to James the stream of thought is governed by five characteristics Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others A similar concept appears in Buddhist philosophy expressed by the Sanskrit term Cittasatna which is usually translated as mindstream or mental continuum Buddhist teachings describe that consciousness manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing The teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events These triggers are input from the five senses seeing hearing smelling tasting or touch sensations or a thought relating to the past present or the future that happen to arise in the mind The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are feelings perceptions and intentionsbehaviour The momentbymoment manifestation of the mindstream is said to happen in every person all the time It even happens in a scientist who analyzes various phenomena in the world or analyzes the material body including the organ brain The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws biological laws psychological laws volitional laws and universal laws The purpose of the Buddhist practice of mindfulness is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics Narrative form In the West the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science stream of consciousness as a narrative mode means writing in a way that attempts to portray the momenttomoment thoughts and experiences of a character This technique perhaps had its beginnings in the monologues of Shakespeares plays and reached its fullest development in the novels of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf although it has also been used by many other noted writers Here for example is a passage from Joyces Ulysses about the thoughts of Molly Bloom Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her Spiritual approaches To most philosophers the word consciousness connotes the relationship between the mind and the world To writers on spiritual or religious topics it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and God or the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world The Canadian psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke author of the 1901

Consciousness awareness of being aware possessed only by humans and Cosmic Consciousness awareness of the life and order of the universe possessed only by humans who have attained intellectual enlightenment or illumination Another thorough account of the spiritual approach is Ken Wilbers 1977 book The Spectrum of Consciousness a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the

    title: "Free will",
    originalContent:
      "Free will is the capacity or ability to choose between different possible courses of action Free will is closely linked to the concepts of moral responsibility praise culpability and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen It is also connected with the concepts of advice persuasion deliberation and prohibition Traditionally only actions that are freely willed are seen as deserving credit or blame Whether free will exists what it is and the implications of whether it exists or not constitute some of the longest running debates of philosophy Some conceive of free will as the ability to act beyond the limits of external influences or wishes Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices undetermined by past events Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible which is inconsistent with a libertarian model of free will Ancient Greek philosophy identified this issue which remains a major focus of philosophical debate The view that posits free will as incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible and hard determinism the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible Another incompatibilist position is hard incompatibilism which holds not only determinism but also indeterminism to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism In contrast compatibilists hold that free will is compatible with determinism Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is necessary for free will arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another requiring a sense of how choices will turn out Compatibilists thus consider the debate between libertarians and hard determinists over free will vs determinism a false dilemma Different compatibilists offer very different definitions of what free will means and consequently find different types of constraints to be relevant to the issue Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action considering one free of will simply if had one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise one could have done otherwise without physical impediment Many contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity such as to direct ones behavior in a way responsive to reason and there are still further different conceptions of free will each with their own concerns sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will History of free will The problem of free will has been identified in ancient Greek philosophical literature The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both Aristotle 4th century BCE and Epictetus 1st century CE it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them According to Susanne Bobzien the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias 3rd century CE what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doingchoosing or not doingchoosing them The term free will liberum arbitrium was introduced by Christian philosophy 4th century CE It has traditionally meant until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings lack of necessity in human will so that the will is free meant the will does not have to be such as it is This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists Western philosophy The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions and if so what sort of control and to what extent These questions predate the early Greek stoics for example Chrysippus and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these centuries On one hand humans have a strong sense of freedom which leads them to believe that they have free will On the other hand an intuitive feeling of free will could be mistaken It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained entirely by physical law The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either causal closure or physical determinism nomological determinism is asserted With causal closure no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain and with physical determinism the future is determined entirely by preceding events cause and effect The puzzle of reconciling free will with a deterministic universe is known as the problem of free will or sometimes referred to as the dilemma of determinism This dilemma leads to a moral dilemma as well the question of how to assign responsibility for actions if they are caused entirely by past events Compatibilists maintain that mental reality is not of itself causally effective Classical compatibilists have addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds as long as humans are not externally constrained or coerced Modern compatibilists make a distinction between freedom of will and freedom of action that is separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it Given that humans all experience a sense of free will some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions A different approach to the dilemma is that of incompatibilists namely that if the world is deterministic then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an illusion Metaphysical libertarianism is the form of incompatibilism which posits that determinism is false and free will is possible at least some people have free will This view is associated with nonmaterialist constructions including both traditional dualism as well as models supporting more minimal criteria such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire Yet even with physical indeterminism arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign Origination responsibility for free indeterministic choices Free will here is predominantly treated with respect to physical determinism in the strict sense of nomological determinism although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will For example logical and theological determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of destiny and fate and biological cultural and psychological determinism feed the development of compatibilist models Separate classes of compatibilism and incompatibilism may even be formed to represent these Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings Incompatibilism Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined Hard determinists such as dHolbach are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will In contrast metaphysical libertarians such as Thomas Reid Peter van Inwagen and Robert Kane are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true Another view is that of hard incompatibilists which state that free will is incompatible with both determinism and indeterminism Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an intuition pump if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a windup toy a billiard ball a puppet or a robot then people must not have free will This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that even if humans have something in common with these things it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the causal chain Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in voluntary behavior They insist rather that free will means that someone must be the ultimate or originating cause of his actions They must be causa sui in the traditional phrase Being responsible for ones choices is the first cause of those choices where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause The argument then is that if a person has free will then they are the ultimate cause of their actions If determinism is true then all of a persons choices are caused by events and facts outside their control So if everything someone does is caused by events and facts outside their control then they cannot be the ultimate cause of their actions Therefore they cannot have free will This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature The simplified argument runs along these lines if determinism is true then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature Since we can have no control over these matters we also can have no control over the consequences of them Since our present choices and acts under determinism are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature then we have no control over them and hence no free will This is called the consequence argument Peter van Inwagen remarks that CD Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has For example if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing if she had so desired But it follows from the consequence argument that if Jane had remained standing she would have either generated a contradiction violated the laws of nature or changed the past Hence compatibilists are committed to the existence of incredible abilities according to Ginet and van Inwagen One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along oblivious to its decider David Lewis suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if different circumstances had actually obtained in the past Using T F for true and false and for undecided there are exactly nine positions regarding determinismfree will that consist of any two of these three possibilities Incompatibilism may occupy any of the nine positions except 5 8 or 3 which last corresponds to soft determinism Position 1 is hard determinism and position 2 is libertarianism The position 1 of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that D implies FW is untrue and the position 2 of libertarianism adds the contention that FW implies D is untrue Position 9 may be called hard incompatibilism if one interprets as meaning both concepts are of dubious value Compatibilism itself may occupy any of the nine positions that is there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will and either or both may be true or false in principle However the most common meaning attached to compatibilism is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will position 3 Alex Rosenberg makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them Physical determinism is currently disputed by prominent interpretations of quantum mechanics and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic indeterminism in nature fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the uncertainty principle The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is however contested even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events Below these positions are examined in more detail Hard determinism Determinism can be divided into causal logical and theological determinism Corresponding to each of these different meanings there arises a different problem for free will Hard determinism is the claim that determinism is true and that it is incompatible with free will so free will does not exist Although hard determinism generally refers to nomological determinism see causal determinism below it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety Relevant forms of determinism include Causal determinism The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions making it impossible for anything else to happen In its most common form nomological or scientific determinism future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplaces demon Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present and knows all natural laws that govern the universe If the laws of nature were determinate then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future down to the smallest detail Logical determinism The notion that all propositions whether about the past present or future are either true or false The problem of free will in this context is the problem of how choices can be free given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present Theological determinism The idea that the future is already determined either by a creator deity decreeing or knowing its outcome in advance The problem of free will in this context is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance or if they are already set in time Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism such as biological determinism the idea that all behaviors beliefs and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment cultural determinism and psychological determinism Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses such as bioenvironmental determinism are even more common Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism where something near to like that informally known as adequate determinism is perhaps more relevant Despite this hard determinism has grown less popular in present times given scientific suggestions that determinism is false yet the intention of their position is sustained by hard incompatibilism Metaphysical libertarianism One kind of incompatibilism metaphysical libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the agent be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into nonphysical theories and physical or naturalistic theories Nonphysical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation which requires that the world is not closed under physics This includes interactionist dualism which claims that some nonphysical mind will or soul overrides physical causality Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will As consequent of incompatibilism metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with physicalism require physical indeterminism such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require uncaused events nondeterministically caused events and agentsubstancecaused events Noncausal theories Noncausal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed or physical indeterminism Noncausal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition a willing trying or endeavoring on behalf of the agent such as the cognitive component of lifting ones arm Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions It has been suggested however that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular According to noncausal accounts the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events including desire belief intention of something in particular but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom intentional actions are rather selfgenerating The actish feel of some intentional actions do not constitute that events activeness or the agents exercise of active control rather they might be brought about by direct stimulation of someones brain in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person Another question raised by such noncausal theory is how an agent acts upon reason if the said intentional actions are spontaneous Some noncausal explanations involve invoking panpsychism the theory that a quality of mind is associated with all particles and pervades the entire universe in both animate and inanimate entities Eventcausal theories Eventcausal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind like those of the compatibilist yet they presuppose physical indeterminism in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent A number of eventcausal accounts of free will have been created referenced here as deliberative indeterminism centred accounts and efforts of will theory The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the elbow room that libertarians believe necessary A first common objection to eventcausal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it related to the problem of origination A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world Deliberative indeterminism asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process This is intended to provide an indeterminate set of possibilities to choose from while not risking the introduction of luck random decision making The selection process is deterministic although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by Daniel Dennett and John Martin Fischer An obvious objection to such a view is that an agent cannot be assigned ownership over their decisions or preferences used to make those decisions to any greater degree than that of a compatibilist model Centred accounts propose that for any given decision between two possibilities the strength of reason will be considered for each option yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen An obvious objection to such a view is that decisions are explicitly left up to chance and origination or responsibility cannot be assigned for any given decision Efforts of will theory is related to the role of will power in decision making It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent Models of volition have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex highlevel process with an element of physical indeterminism An example of this approach is that of Robert Kane where he hypothesizes that in each case the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort According to Robert Kane such ultimate responsibility is a required condition for free will An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes see nonreductive physicalism Although at the time quantum mechanics and physical indeterminism was only in the initial stages of acceptance in his book Miracles A preliminary study CS Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a nonphysical entity on physical reality Indeterministic physical models particularly those involving quantum indeterminacy introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level These events might affect brain activity and could seemingly allow incompatibilist free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes for instance subjective perceptions of control in conscious volition map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct This relationship however requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events Secondarily these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition as studied in the neuroscience of free will It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself rendering limited our ability to identify causality Niels Bohr one of the main architects of quantum theory suggested however that no connection could be made between indeterminism of nature and freedom of will Agentsubstancecausal theories Agentsubstancecausal accounts of incompatibilist free will rely upon substance dualism in their description of mind The agent is assumed power to intervene in the physical world Agent substancecausal accounts have been suggested by both George Berkeley and Thomas Reid It is required that what the agent causes is not causally determined by prior events It is also required that the agents causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events A number of problems have been identified with this view Firstly it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent which suggests they may be random or determined by luck without an underlying basis for the free will decision Secondly it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind a common problem associated with interactionalist dualism Hard incompatibilism Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist whether the world is deterministic or not Derk Pereboom has defended hard incompatibilism identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminismdeterminism among them the following Determinism D is true D does not imply we lack free will F but in fact we do lack F D is true D does not imply we lack F but in fact we dont know if we have F D is true and we do have F D is true we have F and F implies D D is unproven but we have F D isnt true we do have F and would have F even if D were true D isnt true we dont have F but F is compatible with D Derk Pereboom Living without Free Will p xvi Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 soft determinism position 1 a form of hard determinism position 6 a form of classical libertarianism and any position that includes having F as compatibilism John Locke denied that the phrase free will made any sense compare with theological noncognitivism a similar stance on the existence of God He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to postpone a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice the will in truth signifies nothing but a power or ability to prefer or choose The contemporary philosopher Galen Strawson agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the problem He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless According to Strawson if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect This is because to be responsible in some situation S one must have been responsible for the way one was at S1 To be responsible for the way one was at S1 one must have been responsible for the way one was at S2 and so on At some point in the chain there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain But this is impossible Man cannot create himself or his mental states ex nihilo This argument entails that free will itself is absurd but not that it is incompatible with determinism Strawson calls his own view pessimism but it can be classified as hard incompatibilism Causal determinism Causal determinism is the concept that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality in such a way that any state of an object or event is completely determined by prior states Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or selfcaused The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism or scientific determinism the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events Quantum mechanics poses a serious challenge to this view Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be deterministic Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out indeterminism with respect to violations of causal closure it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law Interpretations of quantum mechanics at present are both deterministic and indeterministic and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation Destiny and fate Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events It may be conceived as a predetermined future whether in general or of an individual It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos Although often used interchangeably the words fate and destiny have distinct connotations Fate generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from and over which one has no control Fate is related to determinism but makes no specific claim of physical determinism Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally see for instance theological determinism Destiny likewise is related to determinism but makes no specific claim of physical determinism Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur Destiny implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course ie it does not necessarily conflict with incompatibilist free will Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen determined to represent destiny Logical determinism Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers Logical determinism or determinateness is the notion that all propositions whether about the past present or future are either true or false This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present that is it is already determined as either true or false and is referred to as the problem of future contingents Omniscience Omniscience is the capacity to know everything that there is to know included in which are all future events and is a property often attributed to a creator deity Omniscience implies the existence of destiny Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level predeterminism such as hard theological determinism or predestination that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance In such a case even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system their choices in regard to this cannot be their own as is the case with libertarian free will Omniscience features as an incompatibleproperties argument for the existence of God known as the argument from free will and is closely related to other such arguments for example the incompatibility of omnipotence with a good creator deity ie if a deity knew what they were going to choose then they are responsible for letting them choose it Predeterminism Predeterminism is the idea that all events are determined in advance Predeterminism is the philosophy that all events of history past present and future have been decided or are known by God fate or some other force including human actions Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with or have no bearing on the outcomes of a predetermined course of events and that ones destiny was established externally for example exclusively by a creator deity The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking causal determinism implying that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe In the case of predeterminism this chain of events has been preestablished and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this preestablished chain Predeterminism can be used to mean such preestablished causal determinism in which case it is categorised as a specific type of determinism It can also be used interchangeably with causal determinism in the context of its capacity to determine future events Despite this predeterminism is often considered as independent of causal determinism The term predeterminism is also frequently used in the context of biology and heredity in which case it represents a form of biological determinism The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events therefore done presumably by a conscious being While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a someone who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural causal universe Predestination asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance and is a famous doctrine of the Calvinists in Christian theology Predestination is often considered a form of hard theological determinism Predeterminism has therefore been compared to fatalism Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen so that humans have no control over their future Theological determinism Theological determinism is a form of determinism stating that all events that happen are preordained or predestined to happen by a monotheistic deity or that they are destined to occur given its omniscience Two forms of theological determinism exist here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism The first one strong theological determinism is based on the concept of a creator deity dictating all events in history everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient omnipotent divinity The second form weak theological determinism is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge because Gods omniscience is perfect what God knows about the future will inevitably happen which means consequently that the future is already fixed There exist slight variations on the above categorisation Some claim that theological determinism requires predestination of all events and outcomes by the divinity that is they do not classify the weaker version as theological determinism unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence or that the weaker version does not constitute theological determinism at all Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of causal determinism in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilismincompatibilism below theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism There are various implications for metaphysical libertarian free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will and is a form of hard theological determinism equivalent to theological fatalism below It claims that free will does not exist and God has absolute control over a persons actions Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to hard determinism although it does not invalidate compatibilist free will Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism see figure top left Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon ones philosophical interpretation of omniscience and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism known as theological fatalism or as soft theological determinism terminology used for clarity only Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions holding that God while knowing their actions before they happen does not affect the outcome Gods providence is compatible with voluntary choice Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism see figure top right A rejection of theological determinism or divine foreknowledge is classified as theological incompatibilism also see figure bottom and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows Assume divine foreknowledge or omniscience Infallible foreknowledge implies destiny it is known for certain what one will do Destiny eliminates alternate possibility one cannot do otherwise Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge omniscience and therefore theological determinism On the other hand theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises many of which have received some degree of contention Theological compatibilist responses have included Deny the truth value of future contingents although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism Assert differences in nontemporal knowledge spacetime independence an approach taken for example by Boethius Thomas Aquinas and CS Lewis Deny the Principle of Alternate Possibilities If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act you do not act freely For example a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events In the definition of compatibilism and incompatibilism the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism predeterminism theological determinism etc As such hard determinism with respect to theological determinism or Hard Theological Determinism above might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe or even compatibilism if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will if not hard determinism itself By the same principle metaphysical libertarianism a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism if it was assumed such free will events were preordained and therefore were destined to occur but of which whose outcomes were not predestined or determined by God If hard theological determinism is accepted if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God then metaphysical libertarianism is not however possible and would require reclassification as hard incompatibilism for example given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also Mindbody problem The idea of free will is one aspect of the mindbody problem that is consideration of the relation between mind for example consciousness memory and judgment and body for example the human brain and nervous system Philosophical models of mind are divided into physical and nonphysical expositions Cartesian dualism holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance the seat of consciousness and intelligence and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact each retains some measure of autonomy Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events for example the instantaneous reaction to being burned Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic and in which external mind controls at least some physical events providing an interpretation of incompatibilist free will Stemming from Cartesian dualism a formulation sometimes called interactionalist dualism suggests a twoway interaction that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the threeworld formulation of Popper Cartesian dualism and Poppers three worlds are two forms of what is called epistemological pluralism that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include psychophysical parallelism and epiphenomenalism Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mindbody problem is not reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences A contrasting approach is called physicalism Physicalism is a philosophical theory holding that everything that exists is no more extensive than its physical properties that is that there are no nonphysical substances for example physically independent minds Physicalism can be reductive or nonreductive Reductive physicalism is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical or material basis Alternatively nonreductive physicalism asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties that mental states such as qualia are not ontologically reducible to physical states Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states In one such construction anomalous monism mental events supervene on physical events describing the emergence of mental properties correlated with physical properties implying causal reducibility Nonreductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as property dualism rather than monism yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states see epiphenomenalism Incompatibilism requires a distinction between the mental and the physical being a commentary on the incompatibility of determined physical reality and ones presumably distinct experience of will Secondarily metaphysical libertarian free will must assert influence on physical reality and where mind is responsible for such influence as opposed to ordinary system randomness it must be distinct from body to accomplish this Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will ie interactionalist dualism and nonreductive physicalism It has been noted that the laws of physics have yet to resolve the hard problem of consciousness Solving the hard problem of consciousness involves determining how physiological processes such as ions flowing across the nerve membrane cause us to have experiences According to some Intricately related to the hard problem of consciousness the hard problem of free will represents the core problem of conscious free will Does conscious volition impact the material world Others however argue that consciousness plays a far smaller role in human life than Western culture has tended to believe Compatibilism Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics For instance courts of law make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics Similarly political liberty is a nonmetaphysical concept Likewise some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to ones determined motives without hindrance from other individuals So for example Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics and the Stoic Chrysippus In contrast the incompatibilist positions are concerned with a sort of metaphysically free will which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter though they disagree among themselves about what in turn does matter To be a compatibilist one need not endorse any particular conception of free will but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will Although there are various impediments to exercising ones choices free will does not imply freedom of action Freedom of choice freedom to select ones will is logically separate from freedom to implement that choice freedom to enact ones will although not all writers observe this distinction Nonetheless some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments Some modern compatibilists such as Harry Frankfurt and Daniel Dennett argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do In other words a coerced agents choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agents personal intentions and desires Free will as lack of physical restraint Most classical compatibilists such as Thomas Hobbes claim that a person is acting on the persons own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise if the person had decided to Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of will asserting for example that no liberty can be inferred to the will desire or inclination but the liberty of the man which consisteth in this that he finds no stop in doing what he has the will desire or inclination to doe sic In articulating this crucial proviso David Hume writes this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains Similarly Voltaire in his Dictionnaire philosophique claimed that Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will He asked would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices For him free will or liberty is only the power of acting what is this power It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs Free will as a psychological state Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higherorder brain processing the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity Likewise some modern compatibilists in psychology have tried to revive traditionally accepted struggles of free will with the formation of character Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural sense of agency where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a theory of mind The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the hierarchical mesh The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a firstorder level and also have a desire about the various firstorder desires a secondorder desire to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others A persons will is identified with their effective firstorder desire that is the one they act on and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon that is the persons secondorder desire was effective So for example there are wanton addicts unwilling addicts and willing addicts All three groups may have the conflicting firstorder desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it The first group wanton addicts have no secondorder desire not to take the drug The second group unwilling addicts have a secondorder desire not to take the drug while the third group willing addicts have a secondorder desire to take it According to Frankfurt the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug but their will is overcome by the addiction Finally the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to Frankfurts theory can ramify to any number of levels Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higherorder levels of desire and preference Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together Free will as unpredictability In Elbow Room Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will which he further elaborated in the book Freedom Evolves The basic reasoning is that if one excludes God an infinitely powerful demon and other such possibilities then because of chaos and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world the future is illdefined for all finite beings The only welldefined things are expectations The ability to do otherwise only makes sense when dealing with these expectations and not with some unknown and unknowable future According to Dennett because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects free will can exist Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment Therefore all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves or by random chance More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered as have other critiques In the philosophy of decision theory a fundamental question is From the standpoint of statistical outcomes to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future Newcombs paradox and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices The physical mind Compatibilist models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world including the brain Cognitive naturalism is a physicalist approach to studying human cognition and consciousness in which the mind is simply part of nature perhaps merely a feature of many very complex selfprogramming feedback systems for example neural networks and cognitive robots and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science such as the behavioral and cognitive sciences ie neuroscience and cognitive psychology Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences Overall brain health substance dependence depression and various personality disorders clearly influence mental activity and their impact upon volition is also important For example an addict may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction but be unable to do so The will is disconnected from the freedom to act This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of dopamine in the brain The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity such as deliberation can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome Although compatibilism is generally aligned to or is at least compatible with physicalism some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism A description of how conscious experience might affect brains has been provided in which the experience of conscious free will is the firstperson perspective of the neural correlates of choosing Recently Claudio Costa developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism According to him physical psychological and rational restrictions can interfere at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action Correspondingly there can be physical restrictions to the body psychological restrictions to the decision and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons desires plus beliefs that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action The last two are usually called restrictions of free will The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent One example was the collective suicide led by Jim Jones The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external even if ungrounded reasons Nonnaturalism Alternatives to strictly naturalist physics such as mindbody dualism positing a mind or soul existing apart from ones body while perceiving thinking choosing freely and as a result acting independently on the body include both traditional religious metaphysics and less common newer compatibilist concepts Also consistent with both autonomy and Darwinism they allow for free personal agency based on practical reasons within the laws of physics While less popular among 21stcentury philosophers nonnaturalist compatibilism is present in most if not almost all religions Other views Some philosophers views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist hard determinist or libertarian For example Ted Honderich holds the view that determinism is true compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false and the real problem lies elsewhere Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time but are abstract entities Further even if they were microlevel events they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level He maintains that incompatibilism is false because even if indeterminism is true incompatibilists have not provided and cannot provide an adequate account of origination He rejects compatibilism because it like incompatibilism assumes a single fundamental notion of freedom There are really two notions of freedom voluntary action and origination Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility On the one side we have our intuitions on the other the scientific facts The new problem is how to resolve this conflict Free will as an illusion Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason that men believe themselves free simply because they are conscious of their actions and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined Baruch Spinoza Ethics David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely verbal issue He suggested that it might be accounted for by a false sensation or seeming experience a velleity which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them On reflection we realize that they were necessary and determined all along According to Arthur Schopenhauer the actions of humans as phenomena are subject to the principle of sufficient reason and thus liable to necessity Thus he argues humans do not possess free will as conventionally understood However the will urging craving striving wanting and desiring as the noumenon underlying the phenomenal world is in itself groundless that is not subject to time space and causality the forms that governs the world of appearance Thus the will in itself and outside of appearance is free Schopenhauer discussed the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in The World as Will and Representation Book 2 Sec 23 But the fact is overlooked that the individual the person is not will as thinginitself but is phenomenon of the will is as such determined and has entered the form of the phenomenon the principle of sufficient reason Hence we get the strange fact that everyone considers himself to be a priori quite free even in his individual actions and imagines he can at any moment enter upon a different way of life But a posteriori through experience he finds to his astonishment that he is not free but liable to necessity that notwithstanding all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct and that from the beginning to the end of his life he must bear the same character that he himself condemns and as it were must play to the end the part he has taken upon himself Schopenhauer elaborated on the topic in Book IV of the same work and in even greater depth in his later essay On the Freedom of the Will In this work he stated You can do what you will but in any given moment of your life you can will only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing Free will as moral imagination Rudolf Steiner who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauers work wrote The Philosophy of Freedom which focuses on the problem of free will Steiner 18611925 initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom freedom of thought and freedom of action The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable as pointed out in the introduction This separation of will from action has a very long history going back at least as far as Stoicism and the teachings of Chrysippus 279206 BCE who separated external antecedent causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions which reflect the outer appearance of the world with our thoughts which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world Acknowledging the many influences on our choices he nevertheless points out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with moral imagination Moral in this case refers to action that is willed while imagination refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united Free will as a pragmatically useful concept William James views were ambivalent While he believed in free will on ethical grounds he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds nor did his own introspections support it Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and therefore could not be settled by science Moreover he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility In his work Pragmatism he wrote that instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise regardless of metaphysical theories He did believe that indeterminism is important as a doctrine of relief it allows for the view that although the world may be in many respects a bad place it may through individuals actions become a better one Determinism he argued undermines meliorism the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world Free will and views of causality In 1739 David Hume in his A Treatise of Human Nature approached free will via the notion of causality It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events and that one must examine more closely the relation between things regularly succeeding one another descriptions of regularity in nature and things that result in other things things that cause or necessitate other things According to Hume causation is on weak grounds Once we realise that A must bring about B is tantamount merely to Due to their constant conjunction we are psychologically certain that B will follow A then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the socalled apriority of causal law ie that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world Kants proof in Critique of Pure Reason which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects Schopenhauers proof from The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason which referenced the socalled intellectuality of representations that is in other words objects and qualia perceived with senses In the 1780s Immanuel Kant suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality and lie outside the rules governing material objects There is a sharp difference between moral judgments and judgments of fact Moral judgments must be a priori judgments Freeman introduces what he calls circular causality to allow for the contribution of selforganizing dynamics the formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals applicable to interactions between neurons and neural masses and between the behaving animal and its environment In this view mind and neurological functions are tightly coupled in a situation where feedback between collective actions mind and individual subsystems for example neurons and their synapses jointly decide upon the behaviour of both Free will according to Thomas Aquinas Thirteenth century philosopher Thomas Aquinas viewed humans as preprogrammed by virtue of being human to seek certain goals but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals our Aristotelian telos His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism In facing choices he argued that humans are governed by intellect will and passions The will is the primary mover of all the powers of the soul and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body Choice falls into five stages i intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable ii intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective iii will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective iv will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means v will elects execution Free will enters as follows Free will is an appetitive power that is not a cognitive power of intellect the term appetite from Aquinass definition includes all forms of internal inclination He states that judgment concludes and terminates counsel Now counsel is terminated first by the judgment of reason secondly by the acceptation of the appetite that is the freewill A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinass view is defended thus Freewill is the cause of its own movement because by his freewill man moves himself to act But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause God therefore is the first cause Who moves causes both natural and voluntary And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them for He operates in each thing according to its own nature Free will as a pseudoproblem Historically most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by free freedom will choice and so forth Defining free will often revolves around the meaning of phrases like ability to do otherwise or alternative possibilities This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudoproblem In response others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology Eastern philosophy Buddhist philosophy Buddhism accepts both freedom and determinism or something similar to it but despite its focus on human agency it rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources According to the Buddha There is free action there is retribution but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one except the connection of those elements Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will nor determinism It preaches a middle doctrine named prattyasamutpda in Sanskrit often translated as dependent origination dependent arising or conditioned genesis It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance In part it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not free to begin with It is also part of the theory of karma in Buddhism The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism In Buddhism the idea of karma is much less deterministic The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining ones destiny in future lives In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice is unwise because it denies the reality of ones physical needs and circumstances Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are predetermined To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action Pubbekatahetuvada the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines Because Buddhists also reject agenthood the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well Instead the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with Jains Nyayists Samkhyists Crvkans and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines In many ways the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of conditionality idappaccayat than a theory of causality especially as it is expounded by Nagarjuna in the Mlamadhyamakakrik Hindu philosophy The six orthodox astika schools of thought in Hindu philosophy do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will For the Samkhya for instance matter is without any freedom and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter The only real freedom kaivalya consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self For the Yoga school only Ishvara is truly free and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings thoughts actions or wills and is thus not at all a freedom of will The metaphysics of the Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will A quotation from Swami Vivekananda a Vedantist offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as freewill the very words are a contradiction because will is what we know and everything that we know is within our universe and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time space and causality To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe it cannot be found here However the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not free because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect The will is not free it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect but there is something behind the will which is free Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter ones past karma It is the coward and the fool who says this is his fate But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate Scientific approaches Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways First physics has addressed the question of whether nature is deterministic which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists compatibilists however view it as irrelevant Second although free will can be defined in various ways all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding Third psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility From an anthropological perspective free will can be regarded as an explanation for human behavior that justifies a socially sanctioned system of rewards and punishments Under this definition free will may be described as a political ideology In a society where people are taught to believe that humans have free will free will may be described as a political doctrine Quantum physics Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic for example in the thought of Democritus or the Crvkans and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient information would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy Modern science on the other hand is a mixture of deterministic and stochastic theories Quantum mechanics predicts events only in terms of probabilities casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world being very far from a potential theory of everything and open to many different interpretations Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena This is not always the case many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects For instance some hardware random number generators work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will based on a perception of free will If a persons action is however only a result of complete quantum randomness mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes such as volition According to many interpretations indeterminism enables free will to exist while others assert the opposite because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will Genetics Like physicists biologists have frequently addressed questions related to free will One of the most heated debates in biology is that of nature versus nurture concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans brains genes and evolutionary histories This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions Steven Pinkers view is that fear of determinism in the context of genetics and evolution is a mistake that it is a confusion of explanation with exculpation Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused as long as behavior responds to praise and blame Moreover it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination Neuroscience and neurophilosophy It has become possible to study the living brain and researchers can now watch the brains decisionmaking process at work A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain in particular the buildup of electrical signal called the readiness potential after German Bereitschaftspotential which was discovered by Kornhuber Deecke in 1965 Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move To determine when subjects felt the intention to move he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock After making a movement the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move this became known as Libets W time Libet found that the unconscious brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will A subjects declaration of intention to move a finger appears after the brain has begun to implement the action suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision before the conscious mental act to do so Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 02 s before movement onset However these authors also found that awareness of action was anticipatory to activity in the muscle underlying the movement the entire process resulting in action involves more steps than just the onset of brain activity The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action with much physical movement entirely unconscious On that basis free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150350 ms free will is a longer term phenomenon and free will is a higher level activity that cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation The bearing of timing experiments upon free will is still under discussion More studies have since been conducted including some that try to support Libets original findings suggest that the cancelling or veto of an action may first arise subconsciously as well explain the underlying brain structures involved suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action Benjamin Libets results are quoted in favor of epiphenomenalism but he believes subjects still have a conscious veto since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action In Freedom Evolves Daniel Dennett argues that a nofreewill conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libets results Kornhuber and Deecke underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential termed BP1 is not a proof of the nonexistence of free will as also unconscious agendas may be free and nondeterministic According to their suggestion man has relative freedom ie freedom in degrees that can be increased or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious panencephalic processes Others have argued that data such as the Bereitschaftspotential undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is completely without any power as the steamwhistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery Adrian G Guggisberg and Annas Mottaz have also challenged those findings A study by Aaron Schurger and colleagues published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences challenged assumptions about the causal nature of the readiness potential itself and the premovement buildup of neural activity in general casting doubt on conclusions drawn from studies such as Libets and Frieds A study that compared deliberate and arbitrary decisions found that the early signs of decision are absent for the deliberate ones It has been shown that in several brainrelated conditions individuals cannot entirely control their own actions though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will For example people with Tourette syndrome and related tic disorders make involuntary movements and utterances called tics despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate Tics are described as semivoluntary or unvoluntary because they are not strictly involuntary they may be experienced as a voluntary response to an unwanted premonitory urge Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward The control exerted from seconds to hours at a time may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic In alien hand syndrome the affected individuals limb will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person The affected limb effectively demonstrates a will of its own The sense of agency does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects an anteriortoposterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed The sense of agency thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex In particular the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory premovement process In a recent study using functional magnetic resonance imaging alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process The clinical definition requires feeling that one limb is foreign or has a will of its own together with observable involuntary motor activity emphasis in original This syndrome is often a result of damage to the corpus callosum either when it is severed to treat intractable epilepsy or due to a stroke The standard neurological explanation is that the felt will reported by the speaking left hemisphere does not correspond with the actions performed by the nonspeaking right hemisphere thus suggesting that the two hemispheres may have independent senses of will In addition one of the most important first rank diagnostic symptoms of schizophrenia is the patients delusion of being controlled by an external force People with schizophrenia will sometimes report that although they are acting in the world they do not recall initiating the particular actions they performed This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body known as proprioception leading to attendant hallucinations and delusions of control Experimental psychology Experimental psychologys contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist Daniel Wegners work on conscious will In his book The Illusion of Conscious Will Wegner summarizes what he believes is empirical evidence supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification or even manipulation Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met The first event immediately precedes the second event and The first event is consistent with having caused the second event For example if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over However if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down that is the first requirement is not met or rather than an explosion the person hears the ring of a telephone that is the second requirement is not met then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior and then they observe themselves performing this behavior As a result people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior However Wegner has been able to manipulate peoples thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference Through such work Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not in fact caused and conversely that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause For instance priming subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause The implication for such work is that the perception of conscious will which he says might be more accurately labelled as the emotion of authorship is not tethered to the execution of actual behaviors but is inferred from various cues through an intricate mental process authorship processing Although many interpret this work as a blow against the argument for free will both psychologists and philosophers have criticized Wegners theories Emily Pronin has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the introspection illusion This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kuglers experiments When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommates lives they regarded their own choices as less predictable Staff at a restaurant described their coworkers lives as more determined having fewer future possibilities than their own lives When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people Caveats have however been identified in studying a subjects awareness of mental events in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience Regardless of the validity of belief in free will it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from One contribution is randomness While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others Another contribution is choice It has been demonstrated that peoples belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice The specificity of the amount of choice is important as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional It is also possible that ones desire for control or other basic motivational patterns act as a third variable Believing in free will Since at least 1959 free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist or more specifically the libertarian that is freedom from determinism What people believe Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive it was not adhered to in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility based on an empirical study of peoples responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive it was naturally adhered to in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general Joshua Knobe and Shaun Nichols have proposed that incompatibilism may or may not be intuitive and that it is dependent to some large degree upon the circumstances whether or not the crime incites an emotional response for example if it involves harming another human being They found that belief in free will is a cultural universal and that the majority of participants said that a our universe is indeterministic and b moral responsibility is not compatible with determinism Studies indicate that peoples belief in free will is inconsistent Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type For example Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility Roy Baumeister and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief or disbelief in free will and found that most people tend to believe in a sort of naive compatibilistic free will The researchers also found that people consider acts more free when they involve a person opposing external forces planning or making random actions Notably the last behaviour random actions may not be possible when participants attempt to perform tasks in a random manner such as generating random numbers their behaviour betrays many patterns Among philosophers A recent 2020 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy 592 Belief in libertarianism amounted to 188 while a lack of belief in free will equaled 112 Among evolutionary biologists 79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free will according to a survey conducted in 2007 14 percent chose no free will and 7 percent did not answer the question Effects of the belief itself Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects The authors concluded in their paper that it is belief in determinism that causes those negative effects Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat In a study conducted by Roy Baumeister after participants read an article arguing against free will they were more likely to lie about their performance on a test where they would be rewarded with cash Provoking a rejection of free will has also been associated with increased aggression and less helpful behaviour However although these initial studies suggested that believing in free will is associated with more morally praiseworthy behavior more recent studies including direct multisite replications with substantially larger sample sizes have reported contradictory findings typically no association between belief in free will and moral behavior casting doubt over the original findings Moreover whether or not these experimental findings are a result of actual manipulations in belief in free will is a matter of debate First of all free will can at least refer to either libertarian indeterministic free will or compatibilistic deterministic free will Having participants read articles that simply disprove free will is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits In other words experimental manipulations purporting to provoke disbelief in free will may instead cause a belief in fatalism which may provide an alternative explanation for previous experimental findings To test the effects of belief in determinism it has been argued that future studies would need to provide articles that do not simply attack free will but instead focus on explaining determinism and compatibilism Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of counterfactual thinking This is worrying because counterfactual thinking If I had done something different is an important part of learning from ones choices including those that harmed others Again this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame these are the results we would expect from increasing peoples belief in fatalism Along similar lines Tyler Stillman has found that belief in free will predicts better job performance In theology Christianity The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil Among Catholics there are those holding to Thomism adopted from what Thomas Aquinas put forth in the Summa Theologica There are also some holding to Molinism which was put forth by Jesuit priest Luis de Molina Among Protestants there is Arminianism held primarily by the Methodist Churches and formulated by Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius and there is also Calvinism held by most in the Reformed tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian John Calvin John Calvin was heavily influenced by Augustine of Hippo views on predestination put forth in his work On the Predestination of the Saints Martin Luther seems to have held views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his On the Bondage of the Will thus rejecting free will In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views the Roman Catholic Council of Trent declared that the free will of man moved and excited by God can by its consent cooperate with God Who excites and invites its action and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification The will can resist grace if it chooses It is not like a lifeless thing which remains purely passive Weakened and diminished by Adams fall free will is yet not destroyed in the race Sess VI cap i and v John Wesley the father of the Methodist tradition taught that humans enabled by prevenient grace have free will through which they can choose God and to do good works with the goal of Christian perfection Upholding synergism the belief that God and man cooperate in salvation Methodism teaches that Our Lord Jesus Christ did so die for all men as to make salvation attainable by every man that cometh into the world If men are not saved that fault is entirely their own lying solely in their own unwillingness to obtain the salvation offered to them John 19 I Thess 59 Titus 21112 Paul the Apostle discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles For whom He foreknew He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son that He might be the firstborn among many brethren and whom He predestined these He also called and whom He called these He also justified and whom He justified these He also glorified Romans 82930 He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself according to the kind intention of His will Ephesians 15 There are also mentions of moral freedom in what are now termed as Deuterocanonical works which the Orthodox and Catholic Churches use In Sirach 15 the text states Do not say It was Gods doing that I fell away for what he hates he does not do Do not say He himself has led me astray for he has no need of the wicked Abominable wickedness the Lord hates and he does not let it happen to those who fear him God in the beginning created human beings and made them subject to their own free choice If you choose you can keep the commandments loyalty is doing the will of God Set before you are fire and water to whatever you choose stretch out your hand Before everyone are life and death whichever they choose will be given them Immense is the wisdom of the Lord mighty in power he sees all things The eyes of God behold his works and he understands every human deed He never commands anyone to sin nor shows leniency toward deceivers Ben Sira 151120 NABRE The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history Judaism In Jewish thought the concept of Free will Hebrew romanized bechirah chofshit bechirah is foundational The most succinct statement is by Maimonides in a two part treatment where human free will is specified as part of the universes Godly design Maimonidess reasoned that human beings must have free will at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil as without this the demands of the prophets would have been meaningless there would be no need for the Torah and Mitzvot commandments and justice could not be administered At the same time Maimonides and other thinkers recognizes the paradox that will arise given i that Judaism simultaneously recognizes Gods omniscience and further ii the nature of Divine providence as understood in Judaism In fact the problem may be seen to overlap several others in Jewish Philosophy Islam In Islam the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with Gods foreknowledge but with Gods jabr or divine commanding power alAshari developed an acquisition or dualagency form of compatibilism in which human free will and divine jabr were both asserted and which became a cornerstone of the dominant Ashari position In Shia Islam Asharis understanding of a higher balance toward predestination is challenged by most theologians Free will according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for mans accountability in hisher actions throughout life Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the Day of Judgement because they are their own however the free will happens with the permission of God Others The philosopher Sren Kierkegaard claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness As a truly omnipotent and good being God could create beings with true freedom over God Furthermore God would voluntarily do so because the greatest good which can be done for a being greater than anything else that one can do for it is to be truly free Alvin Plantingas freewill defense is a contemporary expansion of this theme adding how God free will and evil are consistent Some philosophers follow William of Ockham in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient Some philosophers follow Philo of Alexandria a philosopher known for his homocentrism in holding that free will is a feature of a humans soul and thus that nonhuman animals lack free will See also References Citations Bibliography Hawking Stephen and Mlodinow Leonard The Grand Design New York Bantam Books 2010 Horst Steven 2011 Laws Mind and Free

    title: "Utilitarianism",
    originalContent:
      "In ethical philosophy utilitarianism is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and wellbeing for the affected individuals In other words utilitarian ideas encourage actions that lead to the greatest good for the greatest number Although different varieties of utilitarianism admit different characterizations the basic idea behind all of them is in some sense to maximize utility which is often defined in terms of wellbeing or related concepts For instance Jeremy Bentham the founder of utilitarianism described utility as the capacity of actions or objects to produce benefits such as pleasure happiness and good or to prevent harm such as pain and unhappiness to those affected Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong Unlike other forms of consequentialism such as egoism and altruism egalitarian utilitarianism considers either the interests of all humanity or all sentient beings equally Proponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of issues such as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results act utilitarianism or whether agents should conform to rules that maximize utility rule utilitarianism There is also disagreement as to whether total utility total utilitarianism or average utility average utilitarianism should be maximized The seeds of the theory can be found in the hedonists Aristippus and Epicurus who viewed happiness as the only good the consequentialism of the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi who developed a theory to maximize benefit and minimize harm and in the work of the medieval Indian philosopher Shantideva The tradition of modern utilitarianism began with Jeremy Bentham and continued with such philosophers as John Stuart Mill Henry Sidgwick R M Hare and Peter Singer The concept has been applied towards social welfare economics questions of justice the crisis of global poverty the ethics of raising animals for food and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity Etymology Benthamism the utilitarian philosophy founded by Jeremy Bentham was substantially modified by his successor John Stuart Mill who popularized the term utilitarianism In 1861 Mill acknowledged in a footnote that though Bentham believed himself to be the first person who brought the word utilitarian into use he did not invent it Rather he adopted it from a passing expression in John Galts 1821 novel Annals of the Parish However Mill seems to have been unaware that Bentham had used the term utilitarian in his 1781 letter to George Wilson and his 1802 letter to tienne Dumont Historical background Premodern formulations The importance of happiness as an end for humans has long been argued Forms of hedonism were put forward by the ancient Greek philosophers Aristippus and Epicurus Aristotle argued that eudaimonia is the highest human good Augustine wrote that all men agree in desiring the last end which is happiness The idea that conduct should to be judged by its consequences also existed within the ancient world Consequentialist theories were first developed by the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi who proposed a system that sought to maximize benefit and eliminate harm Mohist consequentialism advocated communitarian moral goods including political stability population growth and wealth but did not support the utilitarian notion of maximizing individual happiness Utilitarian ideas can also be found in the work of medieval philosophers In medieval India the 8thcentury Indian philosopher ntideva wrote that we ought to stop all the present and future pain and suffering of all sentient beings and to bring about all present and future pleasure and happiness In medieval Europe happiness was explored in depth by Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologica During the Renaissance consequentialist ideas are present in the work of political philosophy of Niccol Machiavelli 18th century Utilitarianism as a distinct ethical position only emerged in the 18th century and although it is usually thought to have begun with Jeremy Bentham there were earlier writers who presented theories that were strikingly similar Hutcheson Francis Hutcheson first introduced a key utilitarian phrase in An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue 1725 when choosing the most moral action the amount of virtue in a particular action is proportionate to the number of people it brings happiness to In the same way moral evil or vice is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer The best action is the one that procures the greatest happiness of the greatest numbers and the worst is the one that causes the most misery In the first three editions of the book Hutcheson included various mathematical algorithms to compute the Morality of any Actions In doing so he prefigured the hedonic calculus of Bentham John Gay Some claim that John Gay developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics In Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality 1731 Gay argues that happiness private happiness is the proper or ultimate end of all our actions each particular action may be said to have its proper and peculiar endbutthey still tend or ought to tend to something farther as is evident from hence viz that a man may ask and expect a reason why either of them are pursued now to ask the reason of any action or pursuit is only to enquire into the end of it but to expect a reason ie an end to be assigned for an ultimate end is absurd To ask why I pursue happiness will admit of no other answer than an explanation of the terms This pursuit of happiness is given a theological basis Now it is evident from the nature of God viz his being infinitely happy in himself from all eternity and from his goodness manifested in his works that he could have no other design in creating mankind than their happiness and therefore he wills their happiness therefore the means of their happiness therefore that my behaviour as far as it may be a means of the happiness of mankind should be suchthus the will of God is the immediate criterion of Virtue and the happiness of mankind the criterion of the will of God and therefore the happiness of mankind may be said to be the criterion of virtue but once removedandI am to do whatever lies in my power towards promoting the happiness of mankind Hume In An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals 1751 David Hume writesIn all determinations of morality this circumstance of public utility is ever principally in view and wherever disputes arise either in philosophy or common life concerning the bounds of duty the question cannot by any means be decided with greater certainty than by ascertaining on any side the true interests of mankind If any false opinion embraced from appearances has been found to prevail as soon as farther experience and sounder reasoning have given us juster notions of human affairs we retract our first sentiment and adjust anew the boundaries of moral good and evil Paley Gays theological utilitarianism was developed and popularized by William Paley It has been claimed that Paley was not a very original thinker and that the philosophies in his treatise on ethics is an assemblage of ideas developed by others and is presented to be learned by students rather than debated by colleagues Nevertheless his book The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy 1785 was a required text at Cambridge and Smith 1954 says that Paleys writings were once as well known in American colleges as were the readers and spellers of William McGuffey and Noah Webster in the elementary schools Schneewind 1977 writes that utilitarianism first became widely known in England through the work of William Paley The nowforgotten significance of Paley can be judged from the title of Thomas Rawson Birkss 1874 work Modern Utilitarianism or the Systems of Paley Bentham and Mill Examined and Compared Apart from restating that happiness as an end is grounded in the nature of God Paley also discusses the place of rules writing Actions are to be estimated by their tendency Whatever is expedient is right It is the utility of any moral rule alone which constitutes the obligation of it But to all this there seems a plain objection viz that many actions are useful which no man in his senses will allow to be right There are occasions in which the hand of the assassin would be very useful The true answer is this that these actions after all are not useful and for that reason and that alone are not right To see this point perfectly it must be observed that the bad consequences of actions are twofold particular and general The particular bad consequence of an action is the mischief which that single action directly and immediately occasions The general bad consequence is the violation of some necessary or useful general rule You cannot permit one action and forbid another without showing a difference between them Consequently the same sort of actions must be generally permitted or generally forbidden Where therefore the general permission of them would be pernicious it becomes necessary to lay down and support the rule which generally forbids them Classical utilitarianism Jeremy Bentham Benthams book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation was printed in 1780 but not published until 1789 It is possible that Bentham was spurred on to publish after he saw the success of Paleys Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy Though Benthams book was not an immediate success his ideas were spread further when Pierre tienne Louis Dumont translated edited selections from a variety of Benthams manuscripts into French Trait de lgislation civile et pnale was published in 1802 and then later retranslated back into English by Hildreth as The Theory of Legislation although by this time significant portions of Dumonts work had already been retranslated and incorporated into Sir John Bowrings edition of Benthams works which was issued in parts between 1838 and 1843 Perhaps aware that Francis Hutcheson eventually removed his algorithms for calculating the greatest happiness because they appeard useless and were disagreeable to some readers Bentham contends that there is nothing novel or unwarranted about his method for in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest is perfectly conformable to Rosen 2003 warns that descriptions of utilitarianism can bear little resemblance historically to utilitarians like Bentham and J S Mill and can be more a crude version of act utilitarianism conceived in the twentieth century as a straw man to be attacked and rejected It is a mistake to think that Bentham is not concerned with rules His seminal work is concerned with the principles of legislation and the hedonic calculus is introduced with the words Pleasures then and the avoidance of pains are the ends that the legislator has in view In Chapter VII Bentham says The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society by punishing and rewarding In proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious will be the demand it creates for punishment Principle of utility Benthams work opens with a statement of the principle of utility Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters pain and pleasure It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question or what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness I say of every action whatsoever and therefore not only of every action of a private individual but of every measure of government Hedonic calculus In Chapter IV Bentham introduces a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain considered by itself can be measured according to its intensity duration certaintyuncertainty and propinquityremoteness In addition it is necessary to consider the tendency of any act by which it is produced and therefore to take account of the acts fecundity or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind and its purity or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind Finally it is necessary to consider the extent or the number of people affected by the action Evils of the first and second order The question then arises as to when if at all it might be legitimate to break the law This is considered in The Theory of Legislation where Bentham distinguishes between evils of the first and second order Those of the first order are the more immediate consequences those of the second are when the consequences spread through the community causing alarm and danger It is true there are cases in which if we confine ourselves to the effects of the first order the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil Were the offence considered only under this point of view it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime and which makes punishment necessary Let us take for example the physical desire of satisfying hunger Let a beggar pressed by hunger steal from a rich mans house a loaf which perhaps saves him from starving can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself with the evil which the rich man suffers It is not on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to erect these actions into offences but on account of the evil of the second order John Stuart Mill Mill was brought up as a Benthamite with the explicit intention that he would carry on the cause of utilitarianism Mills book Utilitarianism first appeared as a series of three articles published in Frasers Magazine in 1861 and was reprinted as a single book in 1863 Higher and lower pleasures Mill rejects a purely quantitative measurement of utility and says It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognize the fact that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others It would be absurd that while in estimating all other things quality is considered as well as quantity the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone The word utility is used to mean general wellbeing or happiness and Mills view is that utility is the consequence of a good action Utility within the context of utilitarianism refers to people performing actions for social utility With social utility he means the wellbeing of many people Mills explanation of the concept of utility in his work Utilitarianism is that people really do desire happiness and since each individual desires their own happiness it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone contributing to a larger social utility Thus an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action or as Jeremy Bentham the founder of early Utilitarianism put it as the greatest happiness of the greatest number Mill not only viewed actions as a core part of utility but as the directive rule of moral human conduct The rule being that we should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society This view of pleasure was hedonistic as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life This concept was adopted by Bentham and can be seen in his works According to Mill good actions result in pleasure and that there is no higher end than pleasure Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good character Better put the justification of character and whether an action is good or not is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct In the last chapter of Utilitarianism Mill concludes that justice as a classifying factor of our actions being just or unjust is one of the certain moral requirements and when the requirements are all regarded collectively they are viewed as greater according to this scale of social utility as Mill puts it He also notes that contrary to what its critics might say there is no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation However he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual pleasures are thought to have circumstantial advantages ie greater permanency safety uncostliness c Instead Mill will argue that some pleasures are intrinsically better than others The accusation that hedonism is a doctrine worthy only of swine has a long history In Nicomachean Ethics Book 1 Chapter 5 Aristotle says that identifying the good with pleasure is to prefer a life suitable for beasts The theological utilitarians had the option of grounding their pursuit of happiness in the will of God the hedonistic utilitarians needed a different defence Mills approach is to argue that the pleasures of the intellect are intrinsically superior to physical pleasures Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beasts pleasures no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool no instructed person would be an ignoramus no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base even though they should be persuaded that the fool the dunce or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy is capable probably of more acute suffering and certainly accessible to it at more points than one of an inferior type but in spite of these liabilities he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied And if the fool or the pig are of a different opinion it is because they only know their own side of the question Mill argues that if people who are competently acquainted with two pleasures show a decided preference for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and would not resign it for any quantity of the other then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality Mill recognizes that these competent judges will not always agree and states that in cases of disagreement the judgment of the majority is to be accepted as final Mill also acknowledges that many who are capable of the higher pleasures occasionally under the influence of temptation postpone them to the lower But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure for there is no other way of measuring the acutest of two pains or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied and a highlyendowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for as the world is constitute is imperfect Mill also thinks that intellectual pursuits have value out of proportion to the amount of contentment or pleasure the mental state that they produce Mill also says that people should pursue these grand ideals because if they choose to have gratification from petty pleasures some displeasure will eventually creep in We will become bored and depressed Mill claims that gratification from petty pleasures only gives shortterm happiness and subsequently worsens the individual who may feel that his life lacks happiness since the happiness is transient Whereas intellectual pursuits give longterm happiness because they provide the individual with constant opportunities throughout the years to improve his life by benefiting from accruing knowledge Mill views intellectual pursuits as capable of incorporating the finer things in life while petty pursuits do not achieve this goal Mill is saying that intellectual pursuits give the individual the opportunity to escape the constant depression cycle since these pursuits allow them to achieve their ideals while petty pleasures do not offer this Although debate persists about the nature of Mills view of gratification this suggests bifurcation in his position Proving the principle of utility In Chapter Four of Utilitarianism Mill considers what proof can be given for the principle of utility The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible is that people actually see it The only proof that a sound is audible is that people hear it In like manner I apprehend the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable is that people do actually desire it No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable except that each person so far as he believes it to be attainable desires his own happinesswe have not only all the proof which the case admits of but all which it is possible to require that happiness is a good that each persons happiness is a good to that person and the general happiness therefore a good to the aggregate of all persons It is usual to say that Mill is committing a number of fallacies naturalistic fallacy Mill is trying to deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do equivocation fallacy Mill moves from the fact that 1 something is desirable ie is capable of being desired to the claim that 2 it is desirable ie that it ought to be desired and the fallacy of composition the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness Such allegations began to emerge in Mills lifetime shortly after the publication of Utilitarianism and persisted for well over a century though the tide has been turning in recent discussions Nonetheless a defence of Mill against all three charges with a chapter devoted to each can be found in Necip Fikri Alicans Mills Principle of Utility A Defense of John Stuart Mills Notorious Proof 1994 This is the first and remains the only booklength treatment of the subject matter Yet the alleged fallacies in the proof continue to attract scholarly attention in journal articles and book chapters Hall 1949 and Popkin 1950 defend Mill against this accusation pointing out that he begins Chapter Four by asserting that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof in the ordinary acceptation of the term and that this is common to all first principles Therefore according to Hall and Popkin Mill does not attempt to establish that what people do desire is desirable but merely attempts to make the principles acceptable The type of proof Mill is offering consists only of some considerations which Mill thought might induce an honest and reasonable man to accept utilitarianism Having claimed that people do in fact desire happiness Mill now has to show that it is the only thing they desire Mill anticipates the objection that people desire other things such as virtue He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a means to happiness eventually it becomes part of someones happiness and is then desired as an end in itself The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure as music for instance or any given exemption from pain as for example health are to be looked upon as means to a collective something termed happiness and to be desired on that account They are desired and desirable in and for themselves besides being means they are a part of the end Virtue according to the utilitarian doctrine is not naturally and originally part of the end but it is capable of becoming so and in those who love it disinterestedly it has become so and is desired and cherished not as a means to happiness but as a part of their happiness We may give what explanation we please of this unwillingness we may attribute it to pride a name which is given indiscriminately to some of the most and to some of the least estimable feelings of which is mankind are capable we may refer it to the love of liberty and personal independence an appeal to which was with the Stoics one of the most effective means for the inculcation of it to the love of power or the love of excitement both of which do really enter into and contribute to it but its most appropriate appellation is a sense of dignity which all humans beings possess in one form or other and in some though by no means in exact proportion to their higher faculties and which is so essential a part of the happiness of those in whom it is strong that nothing which conflicts with it could be otherwise than momentarily an object of desire to them Henry Sidgwick Sidgwicks book The Methods of Ethics has been referred to as the peak or culmination of classical utilitarianism His main goal in this book is to ground utilitarianism in the principles of commonsense morality and thereby dispense with the doubts of his predecessors that these two are at odds with each other For Sidgwick ethics is about which actions are objectively right Our knowledge of right and wrong arises from commonsense morality which lacks a coherent principle at its core The task of philosophy in general and ethics in particular is not so much to create new knowledge but to systematize existing knowledge Sidgwick tries to achieve this by formulating methods of ethics which he defines as rational procedures for determining right conduct in any particular case He identifies three methods intuitionism which involves various independently valid moral principles to determine what ought to be done and two forms of hedonism in which rightness only depends on the pleasure and pain following from the action Hedonism is subdivided into egoistic hedonism which only takes the agents own wellbeing into account and universal hedonism or utilitarianism which is concerned with everyones wellbeing Intuitionism holds that we have intuitive ie noninferential knowledge of moral principles which are selfevident to the knower The criteria for this type of knowledge include that they are expressed in clear terms that the different principles are mutually consistent with each other and that there is expert consensus on them According to Sidgwick commonsense moral principles fail to pass this test but there are some more abstract principles that pass it like that what is right for me must be right for all persons in precisely similar circumstances or that one should be equally concerned with all temporal parts of ones life The most general principles arrived at this way are all compatible with utilitarianism which is why Sidgwick sees a harmony between intuitionism and utilitarianism There are also less general intuitive principles like the duty to keep ones promises or to be just but these principles are not universal and there are cases where different duties stand in conflict with each other Sidgwick suggests that we resolve such conflicts in a utilitarian fashion by considering the consequences of the conflicting actions The harmony between intuitionism and utilitarianism is a partial success in Sidgwicks overall project but he sees full success impossible since egoism which he considers as equally rational cannot be reconciled with utilitarianism unless religious assumptions are introduced Such assumptions for example the existence of a personal God who rewards and punishes the agent in the afterlife could reconcile egoism and utilitarianism But without them we have to admit a dualism of practical reason that constitutes a fundamental contradiction in our moral consciousness Developments in the 20th century Ideal utilitarianism The description of ideal utilitarianism was first used by Hastings Rashdall in The Theory of Good and Evil 1907 but it is more often associated with G E Moore In Ethics 1912 Moore rejects a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argues that there is a range of values that might be maximized Moores strategy was to show that it is intuitively implausible that pleasure is the sole measure of what is good He says that such an assumption involves our saying for instance that a world in which absolutely nothing except pleasure existedno knowledge no love no enjoyment of beauty no moral qualitiesmust yet be intrinsically betterbetter worth creatingprovided only the total quantity of pleasure in it were the least bit greater than one in which all these things existed as well as pleasure It involves our saying that even if the total quantity of pleasure in each was exactly equal yet the fact that all the beings in the one possessed in addition knowledge of many different kinds and a full appreciation of all that was beautiful or worthy of love in their world whereas none of the beings in the other possessed any of these things would give us no reason whatever for preferring the former to the latter Moore admits that it is impossible to prove the case either way but he believed that it was intuitively obvious that even if the amount of pleasure stayed the same a world that contained such things as beauty and love would be a better world He adds that if a person was to take the contrary view then I think it is selfevident that he would be wrong Act and rule utilitarianism In the mid20th century a number of philosophers focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thought It was already considered necessary to use rules to help choose the right action because estimating the consequences every time seemed errorprone and unlikely to bring the best outcome Paley had justified the use of rules and Mill says It is truly a whimsical supposition that if mankind were agreed in considering utility to be the test of morality they would remain without any agreement as to what is useful and would take no measures for having their notions on the subject taught to the young and enforced by law and opinion to consider the rules of morality as improvable is one thing to pass over the intermediate generalisations entirely and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the first principle is another The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy because sailors cannot wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack Being rational creatures they go to sea with it ready calculated and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on the common questions of right and wrong However rule utilitarianism proposes a more central role for rules that was thought to rescue the theory from some of its more devastating criticisms particularly problems to do with justice and promise keeping Smart 1956 and McCloskey 1957 initially use the terms extreme and restricted utilitarianism but eventually settled on the prefixes act and rule instead Likewise throughout the 1950s and 1960s articles were published both for and against the new form of utilitarianism and through this debate the theory we now call rule utilitarianism was created In an introduction to an anthology of these articles the editor was able to say The development of this theory was a dialectical process of formulation criticism reply and reformulation the record of this process well illustrates the cooperative development of a philosophical theory 1 The essential difference is in what determines whether or not an action is the right action Act utilitarianism maintains that an action is right if it maximizes utility rule utilitarianism maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility In 1956 Urmson 1953 published an influential article arguing that Mill justified rules on utilitarian principles From then on articles have debated this interpretation of Mill In all probability it was not a distinction that Mill was particularly trying to make and so the evidence in his writing is inevitably mixed A collection of Mills writing published in 1977 includes a letter that seems to tip the balance in favour of the notion that Mill is best classified as an act utilitarian In the letter Mill says I agree with you that the right way of testing actions by their consequences is to test them by the natural consequences of the particular action and not by those which would follow if everyone did the same But for the most part the consideration of what would happen if everyone did the same is the only means we have of discovering the tendency of the act in the particular case Some school level textbooks and at least one British examination board make a further distinction between strong and weak rule utilitarianism However it is not clear that this distinction is made in the academic literature It has been argued that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism because for any given rule in the case where breaking the rule produces more utility the rule can be refined by the addition of a subrule that handles cases like the exception This process holds for all cases of exceptions and so the rules have as many subrules as there are exceptional cases which in the end makes an agent seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility Twolevel utilitarianism In Principles 1973 R M Hare accepts that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism but claims that this is a result of allowing the rules to be as specific and ungeneral as we please He argues that one of the main reasons for introducing rule utilitarianism was to do justice to the general rules that people need for moral education and character development and he proposes that a difference between actutilitarianism and ruleutilitarianism can be introduced by limiting the specificity of the rules ie by increasing their generality 14 This distinction between a specific rule utilitarianism which collapses into act utilitarianism and general rule utilitarianism forms the basis of Hares twolevel utilitarianism When we are playing God or the ideal observer we use the specific form and we will need to do this when we are deciding what general principles to teach and follow When we are inculcating or in situations where the biases of our human nature are likely to prevent us doing the calculations properly then we should use the more general rule utilitarianism Hare argues that in practice most of the time we should be following the general principles 17 One ought to abide by the general principles whose general inculcation is for the best harm is more likely to come in actual moral situations from questioning these rules than from sticking to them unless the situations are very extraordinary the results of sophisticated felicific calculations are not likely human nature and human ignorance being what they are to lead to the greatest utility In Moral Thinking 1981 Hare illustrated the two extremes The archangel is the hypothetical person who has perfect knowledge of the situation and no personal biases or weaknesses and always uses critical moral thinking to decide the right thing to do In contrast the prole is the hypothetical person who is completely incapable of critical thinking and uses nothing but intuitive moral thinking and of necessity has to follow the general moral rules they have been taught or learned through imitation It is not that some people are archangels and others proles but rather that we all share the characteristics of both to limited and varying degrees and at different times Hare does not specify when we should think more like an archangel and more like a prole as this will in any case vary from person to person However the critical moral thinking underpins and informs the more intuitive moral thinking It is responsible for formulating and if necessary reformulating the general moral rules We also switch to critical thinking when trying to deal with unusual situations or in cases where the intuitive moral rules give conflicting advice Preference utilitarianism Preference utilitarianism entails promoting actions that fulfil the preferences of those beings involved The concept of preference utilitarianism was first proposed in 1977 by John Harsanyi in Morality and the Theory of Rational Behaviour however the concept is more commonly associated with R M Hare Peter Singer and Richard Brandt Harsanyi claims that his theory is indebted to 42 Adam Smith who equated the moral point of view with that of an impartial but sympathetic observer Immanuel Kant who insisted on the criterion of universality which may also be described as a criterion of reciprocity the classical utilitarians who made maximizing social utility the basic criterion of morality and the modern theory of rational behaviour under risk and uncertainty usually described as Bayesian decision theory Harsanyi rejects hedonistic utilitarianism as being dependent on an outdated psychology saying that it is far from obvious that everything we do is motivated by a desire to maximize pleasure and minimize pain He also rejects ideal utilitarianism because it is certainly not true as an empirical observation that peoples only purpose in life is to have mental states of intrinsic worth 54 According to Harsanyi preference utilitarianism is the only form of utilitarianism consistent with the important philosophical principle of preference autonomy By this I mean the principle that in deciding what is good and what is bad for a given individual the ultimate criterion can only be his own wants and his own preferences 55 Harsanyi adds two caveats Firstly people sometimes have irrational preferences To deal with this Harsanyi distinguishes between manifest preferences and true preferences The former are those manifested by his observed behaviour including preferences possibly based on erroneous factual beliefs or on careless logical analysis or on strong emotions that at the moment greatly hinder rational choice whereas the latter are the preferences he would have if he had all the relevant factual information always reasoned with the greatest possible care and were in a state of mind most conducive to rational choice 55 It is the latter that preference utilitarianism tries to satisfy The second caveat is that antisocial preferences such as sadism envy and resentment have to be excluded Harsanyi achieves this by claiming that such preferences partially exclude those people from the moral community Utilitarian ethics makes all of us members of the same moral community A person displaying ill will toward others does remain a member of this community but not with his whole personality That part of his personality that harbours these hostile antisocial feelings must be excluded from membership and has no claim for a hearing when it comes to defining our concept of social utility 56 Negative utilitarianism In The Open Society and its Enemies 1945 Karl Popper argues that the principle maximize pleasure should be replaced by minimize pain He believes that it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism He claims that There is from the ethical point of view no symmetry between suffering and happiness or between pain and pleasure In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal namely the appeal for help while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula Maximize pleasure is that it assumes a continuous pleasurepain scale that lets us treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure But from the moral point of view pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure and especially not one mans pain by another mans pleasure Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number one should demand more modestly the least amount of avoidable suffering for all The actual term negative utilitarianism itself was introduced by R N Smart as the title to his 1958 reply to Popper in which he argues that the principle would entail seeking the quickest and least painful method of killing the entirety of humanity In response to Smarts argument Simon Knutsson 2019 has argued that classical utilitarianism and similar consequentialist views are roughly equally likely to entail killing the entirety of humanity as they would seem to imply that one should kill existing beings and replace them with happier beings if possible Consequently Knutsson argues The world destruction argument is not a reason to reject negative utilitarianism in favour of these other forms of consequentialism because there are similar arguments against such theories that are at least as persuasive as the world destruction argument is against negative utilitarianism Furthermore Knutsson notes that one could argue that other forms of consequentialism such as classical utilitarianism in some cases have less plausible implications than negative utilitarianism such as in scenarios where classical utilitarianism implies it would be right to kill everyone and replace them in a manner that creates more suffering but also more wellbeing such that the sum on the classical utilitarian calculus is net positive Negative utilitarianism in contrast would not allow such killing Some versions of negative utilitarianism include Negative total utilitarianism tolerates suffering that can be compensated within the same person Negative preference utilitarianism avoids the problem of moral killing with reference to existing preferences that such killing would violate while it still demands a justification for the creation of new lives A possible justification is the reduction of the average level of preferencefrustration Pessimistic representatives of negative utilitarianism which can be found in the environment of Buddhism Some see negative utilitarianism as a branch within modern hedonistic utilitarianism which assigns a higher weight to the avoidance of suffering than to the promotion of happiness The moral weight of suffering can be increased by using a compassionate utilitarian metric so that the result is the same as in prioritarianism Motive utilitarianism Motive utilitarianism was first proposed by Robert Merrihew Adams in 1976 Whereas act utilitarianism requires us to choose our actions by calculating which action will maximize utility and rule utilitarianism requires us to implement rules that will on the whole maximize utility motive utilitarianism has the utility calculus being used to select motives and dispositions according to their general felicific effects and those motives and dispositions then dictate our choices of actions 60 The arguments for moving to some form of motive utilitarianism at the personal level can be seen as mirroring the arguments for moving to some form of rule utilitarianism at the social level 17 Adams 1976 refers to Sidgwicks observation that Happiness general as well as individual is likely to be better attained if the extent to which we set ourselves consciously to aim at it be carefully restricted 467 Trying to apply the utility calculation on each and every occasion is likely to lead to a suboptimal outcome It is argued that applying carefully selected rules at the social level and encouraging appropriate motives at the personal level are likely to lead to better overall outcomes even though on some individual occasions it leads to the wrong action when assessed according to act utilitarian standards 471 Adams concludes that right action by actutilitarian standards and right motivation by motiveutilitarian standards are incompatible in some cases 475 The necessity of this conclusion is rejected by Fred Feldman who argues that the conflict in question results from an inadequate formulation of the utilitarian doctrines motives play no essential role in it and that precisely the same sort of conflict arises even when MU is left out of consideration and AU is applied by itself Instead Feldman proposes a variant of act utilitarianism that results in there being no conflict between it and motive utilitarianism Criticisms and responses Because utilitarianism is not a single theory but rather a cluster of related theories that have been developed over two hundred years criticisms can be made for different reasons and have different targets Quantifying utility A common objection to utilitarianism is the inability to quantify compare or measure happiness or wellbeing Rachael Briggs writes in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy One objection to this interpretation of utility is that there may not be a single good or indeed any good which rationality requires us to seek But if we understand utility broadly enough to include all potentially desirable endspleasure knowledge friendship health and so onits not clear that there is a unique correct way to make the tradeoffs between different goods so that each outcome receives a utility There may be no good answer to the question of whether the life of an ascetic monk contains more or less good than the life of a happy libertinebut assigning utilities to these options forces us to compare them Utility understood this way is a personal preference in the absence of any objective measurement Utility ignores justice As Rosen 2003 has pointed out claiming that act utilitarians are not concerned about having rules is to set up a straw man Similarly RM Hare refers to the crude caricature of act utilitarianism which is the only version of it that many philosophers seem to be acquainted with Given what Bentham says about second order evils it would be a serious misrepresentation to say that he and similar act utilitarians would be prepared to punish an innocent person for the greater good Nevertheless whether they would agree or not this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory Sheriff scenario A classic version of this criticism was given by H J McCloskey in his 1957 sheriff scenario Suppose that a sheriff were faced with the choice either of framing a Negro for a rape that had aroused hostility to the Negroes a particular Negro generally being believed to be guilty but whom the sheriff knows not to be guiltyand thus preventing serious antiNegro riots which would probably lead to some loss of life and increased hatred of each other by whites and Negroesor of hunting for the guilty person and thereby allowing the antiNegro riots to occur while doing the best he can to combat them In such a case the sheriff if he were an extreme utilitarian would appear to be committed to framing the Negro By extreme utilitarian McCloskey is referring to what later came to be called act utilitarianism He suggests one response might be that the sheriff would not frame the innocent negro because of another rule do not punish an innocent person Another response might be that the riots the sheriff is trying to avoid might have positive utility in the long run by drawing attention to questions of race and resources to help address tensions between the communities In a later article McCloskey says Surely the utilitarian must admit that whatever the facts of the matter may be it is logically possible that an unjust system of punishmenteg a system involving collective punishments retroactive laws and punishments or punishments of parents and relations of the offendermay be more useful than a just system of punishment The Brothers Karamazov An older form of this argument was presented by Fyodor Dostoyevsky in his book The Brothers Karamazov in which Ivan challenges his brother Alyosha to answer his question Tell me straight out I call on youanswer me imagine that you yourself are building the edifice of human destiny with the object of making people happy in the finale of giving them peace and rest at last but for that you must inevitably and unavoidably torture just one tiny creature one child and raise your edifice on the foundation of her unrequited tearswould you agree to be the architect on such conditions And can you admit the idea that the people for whom you are building would agree to accept their happiness on the unjustified blood of a tortured child and having accepted it to remain forever happyThis scenario was illustrated in more depth in 1973 by Ursula K Le Guin in the celebrated short story The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas Predicting consequences Some argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable Daniel Dennett describes this as the Three Mile Island effect Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident it is impossible to know whether ultimately the nearmeltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents Russell Hardin 1990 rejects such arguments He argues that it is possible to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism which is to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these from our ability to correctly apply rational principles that among other things depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actors mental equipment The fact that the latter is limited and can change does not mean that the former has to be rejected If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends it does not follow that we then must change our ethics The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding From the beginning utilitarianism has recognized that certainty in such matters is unobtainable and both Bentham and Mill said that it was necessary to rely on the tendencies of actions to bring about consequences G E Moore writing in 1903 said We certainly cannot hope directly to compare their effects except within a limited future and all the arguments which have ever been used in Ethics and upon which we commonly act in common life directed to shewing that one course is superior to another are apart from theological dogmas confined to pointing out such probable immediate advantages An ethical law has the nature not of a scientific law but of a scientific prediction and the latter is always merely probable although the probability may be very great Demandingness objection Act utilitarianism not only requires everyone to do what they can to maximize utility but to do so without any favouritism Mill said As between his own happiness and that of others utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands The wellbeing of strangers counts just as much as that of friends family or self What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them As Shelly Kagan says Given the parameters of the actual world there is no question that maximally promoting the good would require a life of hardship selfdenial and austerity a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed Hooker 2002 describes two aspects to the problem act utilitarianism requires huge sacrifices from those who are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of your own good even when the aggregate good will be only slightly increased Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism there is no such thing as morally permissible selfsacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty Mill was quite clear about this A sacrifice which does not increase or tend to increase the sum total of happiness it considers as wasted One response to the problem is to accept its demands This is the view taken by Peter Singer who saysNo doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are close to us Few could stand by and watch a child drown many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India The question however is not what we usually do but what we ought to do and it is difficult to see any sound moral justification for the view that distance or community membership makes a crucial difference to our obligationsOthers argue that a moral theory that is so contrary to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly overdemanding requirements One approach is to drop the demand that utility be maximized In Satisficing Consequentialism Michael Slote argues for a form of utilitarianism where an act might qualify as morally right through having good enough consequences even though better consequences could have been produced One advantage of such a system is that it would be able to accommodate the notion of supererogatory actions Samuel Scheffler takes a different approach and amends the requirement that everyone be treated the same In particular Scheffler suggests that there is an agentcentered prerogative such that when the overall utility is being calculated it is permitted to count our own interests more heavily than the interests of others Kagan suggests that such a procedure might be justified on the grounds that a general requirement to promote the good would lack the motivational underpinning necessary for genuine moral requirements and secondly that personal independence is necessary for the existence of commitments and close personal relations and that the value of such commitments yields a positive reason for preserving within moral theory at least some moral independence for the personal point of view Robert Goodin takes yet another approach and argues that the demandingness objection can be blunted by treating utilitarianism as a guide to public policy rather than one of individual morality He suggests that many of the problems arise under the traditional formulation because the conscientious utilitarian ends up having to make up for the failings of others and so contributing more than their fair share Gandjour specifically considers market situations and analyses whether individuals who act in markets may produce a utilitarian optimum He lists several demanding conditions that need to be satisfied individuals need to display instrumental rationality markets need to be perfectly competitive and income and goods need to be redistributed Harsanyi argues that the objection overlooks the fact that people attach considerable utility to freedom from unduly burdensome moral obligations most people will prefer a society with a more relaxed moral code and will feel that such a society will achieve a higher level of average utilityeven if adoption of such a moral code should lead to some losses in economic and cultural accomplishments so long as these losses remain within tolerable limits This means that utilitarianism if correctly interpreted will yield a moral code with a standard of acceptable conduct very much below the level of highest moral perfection leaving plenty of scope for supererogatory actions exceeding this minimum standard Aggregating utility The objection that utilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons came to prominence in 1971 with the publication of John Rawls A Theory of Justice The concept is also important in animal rights advocate Richard Ryders rejection of utilitarianism in which he talks of the boundary of the individual through which neither pain nor pleasure may pass However a similar objection was noted in 1970 by Thomas Nagel who claimed that consequentialism treats the desires needs satisfactions and dissatisfactions of distinct persons as if they were the desires etc of a mass person and even earlier by David Gauthier who wrote that utilitarianism supposes that mankind is a superperson whose greatest satisfaction is the objective of moral action But this is absurd Individuals have wants not mankind individuals seek satisfaction not mankind A persons satisfaction is not part of any greater satisfaction Thus the aggregation of utility becomes futile as both pain and happiness are intrinsic to and inseparable from the consciousness in which they are felt rendering impossible the task of adding up the various pleasures of multiple individuals A response to this criticism is to point out that whilst seeming to resolve some problems it introduces others Intuitively there are many cases where people do want to take the numbers involved into account As Alastair Norcross has saidSuppose that Homer is faced with the painful choice between saving Barney from a burning building or saving both Moe and Apu from the building it is clearly better for Homer to save the larger number precisely because it is a larger number Can anyone who really considers the matter seriously honestly claim to believe that it is worse that one person die than that the entire sentient population of the universe be severely mutilated Clearly notIt may be possible to uphold the distinction between persons whilst still aggregating utility if it accepted that people can be influenced by empathy This position is advocated by Iain King who has suggested the evolutionary basis of empathy means humans can take into account the interests of other individuals but only on a onetoone basis since we can only imagine ourselves in the mind of one other person at a time King uses this insight to adapt utilitarianism and it may help reconcile Benthams philosophy with deontology and virtue ethics Philosopher John Taurek also argued that the idea of adding happiness or pleasures across persons is quite unintelligible and that the numbers of persons involved in a situation are morally irrelevant Taureks basic concern comes down to this we cannot explain what it means to say that things would be five times worse if five people die than if one person dies I cannot give a satisfactory account of the meaning of judgments of this kind he wrote p 304 He argues that each person can only lose one persons happiness or pleasures There is not five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure Each persons potential loss has the same significance to me only as a loss to that person alone because by hypothesis I have an equal concern for each person involved I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss p 307 Derek Parfit 1978 and others have criticized Taureks line and it continues to be discussed Calculating utility is selfdefeating An early criticism which was addressed by Mill is that if time is taken to calculate the best course of action it is likely that the opportunity to take the best course of action will already have passed Mill responded that there had been ample time to calculate the likely effects Namely the whole past duration of the human species During all that time mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions on which experience all the prudence as well as all the morality of life are dependentIt is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones To inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination is not to forbid the use of landmarks and directionposts on the way The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal or that persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather than another Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense on this subject which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters of practical concernment More recently Hardin has made the same point It should embarrass philosophers that they have ever taken this objection seriously Parallel considerations in other realms are dismissed with eminently good sense Lord Devlin notes if the reasonable man worked to rule by perusing to the point of comprehension every form he was handed the commercial and administrative life of the country would creep to a standstill It is such considerations that lead even act utilitarians to rely on rules of thumb as Smart 1973 has called them Special obligations criticism One of the oldest criticisms of utilitarianism is that it ignores our special obligations For example if we were given the choice between saving two random people or our mother most would choose to save their mothers According to utilitarianism such a natural action is immoral The first to respond to this was an early utilitarian and friend of Jeremy Bentham named William Godwin who held in his work Enquiry Concerning Political Justice that such personal needs should be disregarded in favour of the greatest good for the greatest number of people Applying the utilitarian principle that life ought to be preferred which will be most conducive to the general good to the choice of saving one of two people either the illustrious Archbishop of Cambray or his chambermaid he wrote Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife my mother or my benefactor That would not alter the truth of the proposition The life of the Archbishop would still be more valuable than that of the chambermaid and justice pure unadulterated justice would still have preferred that which was most valuable Criticisms of utilitarian value theory Utilitarianisms assertion that wellbeing is the only thing with intrinsic moral value has been attacked by various critics Thomas Carlyle derided Benthamee Utility virtue by Profit and Loss reducing this Godsworld to a dead brute Steamengine the infinite celestial Soul of Man to a kind of Haybalance for weighing hay and thistles on pleasures and pains on Karl Marx in Das Kapital criticises Benthams utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognise that people have different joys in different socioeconomic contexts With the driest naivete he takes the modern shopkeeper especially the English shopkeeper as the normal man Whatever is useful to this queer normal man and to his world is absolutely useful This yardmeasure then he applies to past present and future The Christian religion eg is useful because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of the law Artistic criticism is harmful because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of Martin Tupper etc With such rubbish has the brave fellow with his motto nulla dies sine linea no day without a line piled up mountains of books Pope John Paul II following his personalist philosophy argued that a danger of utilitarianism is that it tends to make persons just as much as things the object of use Utilitarianism he wrote is a civilization of production and of use a civilization of things and not of persons a civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used Dutybased criticisms W D Ross speaking from the perspective of his deontological pluralism acknowledges that there is a duty to promote the maximum of aggregate good as utilitarianism demands But Ross contends this is just one besides various other duties like the duty to keep ones promises or to make amends for wrongful acts which are ignored by the simplistic and reductive utilitarian outlook 19 Roger Scruton was a deontologist and believed that utilitarianism did not give duty the place that it needed inside our ethical judgements He asked us to consider the dilemma of Anna Karenina who had to choose between her love of Vronsky and her duty towards her husband and her son Scruton wrote Suppose Anna were to reason that it is better to satisfy two healthy young people and frustrate one old one than to satisfy one old person and frustrate two young ones by a factor of 25 to 1 ergo I am leaving What would we think then of her moral seriousness Additional considerations Average versus total happiness In The Methods of Ethics Henry Sidgwick asked Is it total or average happiness that we seek to make a maximum Paley notes that although he speaks of the happiness of communities the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients or the pleasure of their perceptions and that if extreme cases such as people held as slaves are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people Consequently the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer and the improvement of it the object which ought in all countries to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever A similar view was expressed by Smart who argued that all other things being equal a universe with two million happy people is better than a universe with only one million happy people Since Sidgwick raised the question it has been studied in detail and philosophers have argued that using either total or average happiness can lead to objectionable results According to Derek Parfit using total happiness falls victim to the repugnant conclusion whereby large numbers of people with very low but nonnegative utility values can be seen as a better goal than a population of a less extreme size living in comfort In other words according to the theory it is a moral good to breed more people on the world for as long as total happiness rises On the other hand measuring the utility of a population based on the average utility of that population avoids Parfits repugnant conclusion but causes other problems For example bringing a moderately happy person into a very happy world would be seen as an immoral act aside from this the theory implies that it would be a moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average as this would raise the average happiness William Shaw suggests that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people who need not concern us and actual future people who should concern us He says utilitarianism values the happiness of people not the production of units of happiness Accordingly one has no positive obligation to have children However if you have decided to have a child then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest child you can Motives intentions and actions Utilitarianism is typically taken to assess the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just the consequences of that action Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from intention and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain He adds that from every kind of motive may proceed actions that are good others that are bad and others that are indifferent Mill makes a similar point and explicitly says that motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action though much with the worth of the agent He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right whether his motive be duty or the hope of being paid for his trouble However with intention the situation is more complex In a footnote printed in the second edition of Utilitarianism Mill says the morality of the action depends entirely upon the intentionthat is upon what the agent wills to do Elsewhere he says Intention and motive are two very different things But it is the intention that is the foresight of consequences which constitutes the moral rightness or wrongness of the act The correct interpretation of Mills footnote is a matter of some debate The difficulty in interpretation centres around trying to explain why since it is consequences that matter intentions should play a role in the assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not One possibility involves supposing that the morality of the act is one thing probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent and its rightness or wrongness another Jonathan Dancy rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent An interpretation given by Roger Crisp draws on a definition given by Mill in A System of Logic where he says that an intention to produce the effect is one thing the effect produced in consequence of the intention is another thing the two together constitute the action Accordingly whilst two actions may outwardly appear to be the same they will be different actions if there is a different intention Dancy notes that this does not explain why intentions count but motives do not A third interpretation is that an action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages and it is the intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy he recognizes that this might not have been Mills own view for Mill would not even allow that p q expresses a complex proposition He wrote in his System of Logic I iv 3 of Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive that we might as well call a street a complex house as these two propositions a complex proposition Finally whilst motives may not play a role in determining the morality of an action this does not preclude utilitarians from fostering particular motives if doing so will increase overall happiness Other sentient beings In An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation Bentham wrote the question is not Can they reason nor Can they talk but Can they suffer Mills distinction between higher and lower pleasures might suggest that he gave more status to humans However in his essay Whewell on Moral Philosophy Mill defends Benthams position calling it a noble anticipation and writing Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man is that practice moral or immoral And if exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness they do not with one voice answer immoral let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned Henry Sidgwick also considers the implications of utilitarianism for nonhuman animals He writes We have next to consider who the all are whose happiness is to be taken into account Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct or are we to confine our view to human happiness The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill and I believe by the Utilitarian school generally and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end as so conceived any pleasure of any sentient being Among contemporary utilitarian philosophers Peter Singer is especially known for arguing that the wellbeing of all sentient beings ought to be given equal consideration Singer suggests that rights are conferred according to the level of a creatures selfawareness regardless of their species He adds that humans tend to be speciesist discriminatory against nonhumans in ethical matters and argues that in utilitarianism speciesism cannot be justified as there is no rational distinction that can be made between the suffering of humans and the suffering of nonhuman animals all suffering ought to be reduced Singer writes The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species The pattern is the same in each case Most human beings are speciesists In his 1990 edition of Animal Liberation Peter Singer said that he no longer ate oysters and mussels because although the creatures might not suffer there was a possibility they may and it was easy to avoid eating them in any case This view still might be contrasted with deep ecology which holds that an intrinsic value is attached to all forms of life and nature whether currently assumed to be sentient or not According to utilitarianism the forms of life that are unable to experience anything akin to either enjoyment or discomfort are denied moral status because it is impossible to increase the happiness or reduce the suffering of something that cannot feel happiness or suffer Singer writes The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare A mouse on the other hand does have an interest in not being tormented because it will suffer if it is If a being suffers there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration No matter what the nature of the being the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like sufferingin so far as rough comparisons can be madeof any other being If a being is not capable of suffering or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness there is nothing to be taken into account Thus the moral value of onecelled organisms as well as some multicellular organisms and natural entities like a river is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings Similarly utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on biodiversity although the benefits that biodiversity brings to sentient beings may mean that in utilitarianism biodiversity ought to be maintained in general In John Stuart Mills essay On Nature he argues that the welfare of wild animals is to be considered when making utilitarian judgments Tyler Cowen argues that if individual animals are carriers of utility then we should consider limiting the predatory activity of carnivores relative to their victims At the very least we should limit current subsidies to natures carnivores Digital minds Nick Bostrom and Carl Shulman consider that as advancements in artificial intelligence continue it will probably be possible to engineer digital minds that require less resources and have a much higher rate and intensity of subjective experience than humans These superbeneficiaries could also be unaffected by hedonic adaptation Nick Bostrom said that we should find paths that will enable digital minds and biological minds to coexist in a mutually beneficial way where all of these different forms can flourish and thrive Application to specific problems The concept has been applied towards social welfare economics questions of justice the crisis of global poverty the ethics of raising animals for food and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity In the context of lying some utilitarians support white lies World poverty An article in the American Economic Journal has addressed the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the best way to make use of the disposable income they receive This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services Many utilitarian philosophers including Peter Singer and Toby Ord argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity Peter Singer for example argues that donating some of ones income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a povertyrelated illness which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort However Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of ones income to charity but also that this money should be directed to the most costeffective charities in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number consistent with utilitarian thinking Singers ideas have formed the basis of the modern

    title: "Developmental psychology",
    originalContent:
      "Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why humans grow change and adapt across the course of their lives Originally concerned with infants and children the field has expanded to include adolescence adult development aging and the entire lifespan Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking feeling and behaviors change throughout life This field examines change across three major dimensions which are physical development cognitive development and social emotional development Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including motor skills executive functions moral understanding language acquisition social change personality emotional development selfconcept and identity formation Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature and nurture on the process of human development as well as processes of change in context across time Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics the individuals behavior and environmental factors including the social context and the built environment Ongoing debates in regards to developmental psychology include biological essentialism vs neuroplasticity and stages of development vs dynamic systems of development Research in developmental psychology has some limitations but at the moment researchers are working to understand how transitioning through stages of life and biological factors may impact our behaviors and development Developmental psychology involves a range of fields such as educational psychology child psychopathology forensic developmental psychology child development cognitive psychology ecological psychology and cultural psychology Influential developmental psychologists from the 20th century include Urie Bronfenbrenner Erik Erikson Sigmund Freud Anna Freud Jean Piaget Barbara Rogoff Esther Thelen and Lev Vygotsky Historical antecedents JeanJacques Rousseau and John B Watson are typically cited as providing the foundation for modern developmental psychology In the mid18th century Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development infants infancy puer childhood and adolescence in Emile Or On Education Rousseaus ideas were adopted and supported by educators at the time Developmental psychology generally focuses on how and why certain changes cognitive social intellectual personality occur over time in the course of a human life Many theorists have made a profound contribution to this area of psychology One of them is the psychologist Erik Erikson who created a model of eight phases of psychosocial development According to his theory people go through different phases in their lives each of which has its own developmental crisis that shapes a persons personality and behavior In the late 19th century psychologists familiar with the evolutionary theory of Darwin began seeking an evolutionary description of psychological development prominent here was the pioneering psychologist G Stanley Hall who attempted to correlate ages of childhood with previous ages of humanity James Mark Baldwin who wrote essays on topics that included Imitation A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness and Mental Development in the Child and the Race Methods and Processes was significantly involved in the theory of developmental psychology Sigmund Freud whose concepts were developmental significantly affected public perceptions Theories Psychosexual development Sigmund Freud developed a theory that suggested that humans behave as they do because they are constantly seeking pleasure This process of seeking pleasure changes through stages because people evolve Each period of seeking pleasure that a person experiences is represented by a stage of psychosexual development These stages symbolize the process of arriving to become a maturing adult The first is the oral stage which begins at birth and ends around a year and a half of age During the oral stage the child finds pleasure in behaviors like sucking or other behaviors with the mouth The second is the anal stage from about a year or a year and a half to three years of age During the anal stage the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with its defecation This period of development often occurs during the time when the child is being toilet trained The child becomes interested with feces and urine Children begin to see themselves as independent from their parents They begin to desire assertiveness and autonomy The third is the phallic stage which occurs from three to five years of age most of a persons personality forms by this age During the phallic stage the child becomes aware of its sexual organs Pleasure comes from finding acceptance and love from the opposite sex The fourth is the latency stage which occurs from age five until puberty During the latency stage the childs sexual interests are repressed Stage five is the genital stage which takes place from puberty until adulthood During the genital stage puberty begins to occur Children have now matured and begin to think about other people instead of just themselves Pleasure comes from feelings of affection from other people Freud believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express To explain this he developed three personality structures id ego and superego The id the most primitive of the three functions according to the pleasure principle seek pleasure and avoid pain The superego plays the critical and moralizing role while the ego is the organized realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego Theories of cognitive development Jean Piaget a Swiss theorist posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through their interactions with their physical and social environments He suggested that the adults role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials In his interview techniques with children that formed an empirical basis for his theories he used something similar to Socratic questioning to get children to reveal their thinking He argued that a principal source of development was through the childs inevitable generation of contradictions through their interactions with their physical and social worlds The childs resolution of these contradictions led to more integrated and advanced forms of interaction a developmental process that he called equilibration Piaget argued that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages generated through the equilibration process Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step He believed that these stages are not separate from one another but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process He proposed four stages sensorimotor preoperational concrete operational and formal operational Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place Stages of moral development Piaget claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages Expanding on Piagets work Lawrence Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that it continued throughout the individuals lifetime He suggested three levels of moral reasoning preconventional moral reasoning conventional moral reasoning and postconventional moral reasoning The preconventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of action Conventional moral reason occurs during late childhood and early adolescence and is characterized by reasoning based on rules and conventions of society Lastly postconventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees societys rules and conventions as relative and subjective rather than as authoritative Kohlberg used the Heinz Dilemma to apply to his stages of moral development The Heinz Dilemma involves Heinzs wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drug Preconventional morality conventional morality and postconventional morality applies to Heinzs situation Stages of psychosocial development GermanAmerican psychologist Erik Erikson and his collaborator and wife Joan Erikson posits eight stages of individual human development influenced by biological psychological and social factors throughout the lifespan At each stage the person must resolve a challenge or an existential dilemma Successful resolution of the dilemma results in the person ingraining a positive virtue but failure to resolve the fundamental challenge of that stage reinforces negative perceptions of the person or the world around them and the persons personal development is unable to progress The first stage Trust vs Mistrust takes place in infancy The positive virtue for the first stage is hope in the infant learning whom to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for himher The second stage is Autonomy vs Shame and Doubt with the positive virtue being will This takes place in early childhood when the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of whereas if the child is overly controlled feelings of inadequacy are reinforced which can lead to low selfesteem and doubt The third stage is Initiative vs Guilt The virtue of being gained is a sense of purpose This takes place primarily via play This is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kids They will ask many questions as their curiosity grows If too much guilt is present the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with their world and other children in it The fourth stage is Industry competence vs Inferiority The virtue for this stage is competency and is the result of the childs early experiences in school This stage is when the child will try to win the approval of others and understand the value of their accomplishments The fifth stage is Identity vs Role Confusion The virtue gained is fidelity and it takes place in adolescence This is when the child ideally starts to identify their place in society particularly in terms of their gender role The sixth stage is Intimacy vs Isolation which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love This is when the person starts to share hisher life with someone else intimately and emotionally Not doing so can reinforce feelings of isolation The seventh stage is Generativity vs Stagnation This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained is care A person becomes stable and starts to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the community The eighth stage is Ego Integrity vs Despair When one grows old they look back on their life and contemplate their successes and failures If they resolve this positively the virtue of wisdom is gained This is also the stage when one can gain a sense of closure and accept death without regret or fear Stages based on the model of hierarchical complexity Michael Commons enhanced and simplified Brbel Inhelder and Piagets developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development The Model of Hierarchical Complexity MHC is not based on the assessment of domainspecific information It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participants successfully addresses He expanded Piagets original eight stage counting the half stages to seventeen stages The stages are Calculatory Automatic Sensory Motor Circular sensorymotor Sensorymotor Nominal Sentential Preoperational Primary Concrete Abstract Formal Systematic Metasystematic Paradigmatic Crossparadigmatic MetaCrossparadigmatic The order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 09 to 098 In the MHC there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy These axioms are a defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action b defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions that is the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine c defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out nonarbitrarily Ecological systems theory Ecological systems theory originally formulated by Urie Bronfenbrenner specifies four types of nested environmental systems with bidirectional influences within and between the systems The four systems are microsystem mesosystem exosystem and macrosystem Each system contains roles norms and rules that can powerfully shape development The microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role Macrosystem refers to the cultural values customs and laws of society The microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual example school or the home setting The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other example sibling relationships at home vs peer relationships at school The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked example a fathers job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughters performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status culture beliefs customs and morals example a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason Lastly the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition example a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life Since its publication in 1979 Bronfenbrenners major statement of this theory The Ecology of Human Development has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments As a result of this conceptualization of development these environmentsfrom the family to economic and political structureshave come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through to adulthood Zone of proximal development Lev Vygotsky was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era who posited that children learn through handson experience and social interactions with members of their culture Vygotsky believed that a childs development should be examined during problemsolving activities Unlike Piaget he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task called the zone of proximal development could help children learn new tasks Zone of proximal development is a tool used to explain the learning of children and collaborating problem solving activities with an adult or peer This adult role is often referred to as the skilled master whereas the child is considered the learning apprentice through an educational process often termed cognitive apprenticeship Martin Hill stated that The world of reality does not apply to the mind of a child This technique is called scaffolding because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn Vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the childs pattern of development arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level In other words Vygotsky claimed that psychology should focus on the progress of human consciousness through the relationship of an individual and their environment He felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness Constructivism Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting organizing and integrating information with other knowledge often in the context of social interactions Constructivism can occur in two ways individual and social Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content A foundational concept of constructivism is that the purpose of cognition is to organize ones experiential world instead of the ontological world around them Jean Piaget a Swiss developmental psychologist proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed Evolutionary developmental psychology Evolutionary developmental psychology is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian evolution particularly natural selection to understand the development of human behavior and cognition It involves the study of both the genetic and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of social and cognitive competencies as well as the epigenetic geneenvironment interactions processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions EDP considers both the reliably developing speciestypical features of ontogeny developmental adaptations as well as individual differences in behavior from an evolutionary perspective While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise evolutionary byproducts andor idiosyncrasies for example peer groups education neighborhoods and chance encounters rather than products of natural selection EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via adaptive developmental plasticity From this perspective human development follows alternative lifehistory strategies in response to environmental variability rather than following one speciestypical pattern of development EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of evolutionary psychology EP but is also distinct from EP in several domains including research emphasis EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny as opposed to adaptations of adulthood and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors ie how development happens in addition to more ultimate factors ie why development happens which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology Attachment theory Attachment theory originally developed by John Bowlby focuses on the importance of open intimate emotionally meaningful relationships Attachment is described as a biological system or powerful survival impulse that evolved to ensure the survival of the infant A threatened or stressed child will move toward caregivers who create a sense of physical emotional and psychological safety for the individual Attachment feeds on body contact and familiarity Later Mary Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation protocol and the concept of the secure base This tool has been found to help understand attachment such as the Strange Situation Test and the Adult Attachment Interview Both of which help determine factors to certain attachment styles The Strange Situation Test helps find disturbances in attachment and whether certain attributes are found to contribute to a certain attachment issue The Adult Attachment Interview is a tool that is similar to the Strange Situation Test but instead focuses attachment issues found in adults Both tests have helped many researchers gain more information on the risks and how to identify them Theorists have proposed four types of attachment styles secure anxiousavoidant anxiousresistant and disorganized Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver It is characterized by trust Anxiousavoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiver This is characterized by the infants indifference toward the caregiver Anxiousresistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent It is possible to prevent a childs innate propensity to develop bonds Some infants are kept in isolation or subjected to severe neglect or abuse or they are raised without the stimulation and care of a regular caregiver This deprivation may cause shortterm consequences such as separation rage despair and a brief lag in cerebral growth Increased aggression clinging behavior alienation psychosomatic illnesses and an elevated risk of adult depression are among the longterm consequences According to attachment theory which is a psychological concept peoples capacity to develop healthy social and emotional ties later in life is greatly impacted by their early relationships with their primary caregivers especially during infancy This suggests that humans have an inbuilt need to develop strong bonds with caregivers in order to survive and be healthy Childhood attachment styles can have an impact on how people behave in adult social situations including romantic partnerships Nature vs nurture A significant debate in developmental psychology is the relationship between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of development This is often referred to as nature and nurture or nativism versus empiricism A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate that is they are specified by the organisms genes What makes a person who they are Is it their environment or their genetics This is the debate of nature vs nurture According to an empiricist viewpoint those processes are learned through interaction with the environment Today developmental psychologists rarely take such polarized positions with regard to most aspects of development rather they investigate among many other things the relationship between innate and environmental influences One of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of evolutionary developmental psychology The dispute over innateness has been well represented in the field of language acquisition studies A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through learning The empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of statistical learning From this perspective language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development such as perceptual learning The nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language Linguist Noam Chomsky asserts that evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input there is a universal grammar that applies to all human languages and is prespecified This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive module suited for learning language often called the language acquisition device Chomskys critique of the behaviorist model of language acquisition is regarded by many as a key turning point in the decline in the prominence of the theory of behaviorism generally But Skinners conception of Verbal Behavior has not died perhaps in part because it has generated successful practical applications Maybe there could be strong interactions of both nature and nurture Continuity vs discontinuity One of the major discussions in developmental psychology includes whether development is discontinuous or continuous Continuous development is quantifiable and quantitative whereas discontinuous development is qualitative Quantitative estimations of development can be measuring the stature of a child and measuring their memory or consideration span Particularly dramatic examples of qualitative changes are metamorphoses such as the emergence of a caterpillar into a butterfly Those psychologists who bolster the continuous view of improvement propose that improvement includes slow and progressing changes all through the life span with behavior within the prior stages of advancement giving the premise of abilities and capacities required for the other stages To many the concept of continuous quantifiable measurement seems to be the essence of science Not all psychologists be that as it may concur that advancement could be a continuous process A few see advancement as a discontinuous process They accept advancement includes unmistakable and partitioned stages with diverse sorts of behavior happening in each organization This proposes that the development of certain capacities in each arrange such as particular feelings or ways of considering have a definite beginning and finishing point Be that as it may theres no correct time at which a capacity abruptly shows up or disappears Although some sorts of considering feeling or carrying on could seem to seem abruptly it is more than likely that this has been developing gradually for some time Stage theories of development rest on the suspicion that development may be a discontinuous process including particular stages which are characterized by subjective contrasts in behavior They moreover assume that the structure of the stages is not variable concurring to each person in any case the time of each arrangement may shift separately Stage theories can be differentiated with ceaseless hypotheses which set that development is an incremental process Stability vs change This issue involves the degree to which one becomes older renditions of their early experience or whether they develop into something different from who they were at an earlier point in development It considers the extent to which early experiences especially infancy or later experiences are the key determinants of a persons development Stability is defined as the consistent ordering of individual differences with respect to some attribute Change is altering someonesomething Most human development lifespan developmentalists recognize that extreme positions are unwise Therefore the key to a comprehensive understanding of development at any stage requires the interaction of different factors and not only one Theory of mind Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states to ourselves and others It is a complex but vital process in which children begin to understand the emotions motives and feelings of not only themselves but also others Theory of mind allows people to understand that others have unique beliefs and desires that are different from our own This enables people to engage in daily social interactions as we explain the mental state around us If a child does not fully develop theory of mind within this crucial 5year period they can suffer from communication barriers that follow them into adolescence and adulthood Exposure to more people and the availability of stimuli that encourages socialcognitive growth is a factor that relies heavily on family Mathematical models Developmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changes Psychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using models A model must simply account for the means by which a process takes place This is sometimes done in reference to changes in the brain that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the development Mathematical modeling is useful in developmental psychology for implementing theory in a precise and easytostudy manner allowing generation explanation integration and prediction of diverse phenomena Several modeling techniques are applied to development symbolic connectionist neural network or dynamical systems models Dynamic systems models illustrate how many different features of a complex system may interact to yield emergent behaviors and abilities Nonlinear dynamics has been applied to human systems specifically to address issues that require attention to temporality such as life transitions human development and behavioral or emotional change over time Nonlinear dynamic systems is currently being explored as a way to explain discrete phenomena of human development such as affect second language acquisition and locomotion Research areas Neural development One critical aspect of developmental psychology is the study of neural development which investigates how the brain changes and develops during different stages of life Neural development focuses on how the brain changes and develops during different stages of life Studies have shown that the human brain undergoes rapid changes during prenatal and early postnatal periods These changes include the formation of neurons the development of neural networks and the establishment of synaptic connections The formation of neurons and the establishment of basic neural circuits in the developing brain are crucial for laying the foundation of the brains structure and function and disruptions during this period can have longterm effects on cognitive and emotional development Experiences and environmental factors play a crucial role in shaping neural development Early sensory experiences such as exposure to language and visual stimuli can influence the development of neural pathways related to perception and language processing Genetic factors play a huge roll in neural development Genetic factors can influence the timing and pattern of neural development as well as the susceptibility to certain developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder Research finds that the adolescent brain undergoes significant changes in neural connectivity and plasticity During this period there is a pruning process where certain neural connections are strengthened while others are eliminated resulting in more efficient neural networks and increased cognitive abilities such as decisionmaking and impulse control The study of neural development provides crucial insights into the complex interplay between genetics environment and experiences in shaping the developing brain By understanding the neural processes underlying developmental changes researchers gain a better understanding of cognitive emotional and social development in humans Cognitive development Cognitive development is primarily concerned with how infants and children acquire develop and use internal mental capabilities such as problemsolving memory and language Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities His theory suggests that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to adulthood and that there is an end point or goal Other accounts such as that of Lev Vygotsky have suggested that development does not progress through stages but rather that the developmental process that begins at birth and continues until death is too complex for such structure and finality Rather from this viewpoint developmental processes proceed more continuously Thus development should be analyzed instead of treated as a product to obtain K Warner Schaie has expanded the study of cognitive development into adulthood Rather than being stable from adolescence Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities Modern cognitive development has integrated the considerations of cognitive psychology and the psychology of individual differences into the interpretation and modeling of development Specifically the neoPiagetian theories of cognitive development showed that the successive levels or stages of cognitive development are associated with increasing processing efficiency and working memory capacity These increases explain differences between stages progression to higher stages and individual differences of children who are the sameage and of the same gradelevel However other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories and are influenced by accounts of domainspecific information processing which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarilyspecified and contentspecific information processing mechanisms Social and emotional development Developmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies For example they study how children form friendships how they understand and deal with emotions and how identity develops Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behavior Emotional regulation or ER refers to an individuals ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts In young children this modulation is in part controlled externally by parents and other authority figures As children develop they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state Studies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers the emotional climate in the home and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the childs emotions Music also has an influence on stimulating and enhancing the senses of a child through selfexpression A childs social and emotional development can be disrupted by motor coordination problems evidenced by the environmental stress hypothesis The environmental hypothesis explains how children with coordination problems and developmental coordination disorder are exposed to several psychosocial consequences which act as secondary stressors leading to an increase in internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptualmotor skills Secondary stressors commonly identified include the tendency for children with poor motor skills to be less likely to participate in organized play with other children and more likely to feel socially isolated Social and emotional development focuses on five keys areas SelfAwareness Self Management Social Awareness Relationship Skills and Responsible Decision Making Physical development Physical development concerns the physical maturation of an individuals body until it reaches the adult stature Although physical growth is a highly regular process all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurts Studies are being done to analyze how the differences in these timings affect and are related to other variables of developmental psychology such as information processing speed Traditional measures of physical maturity using xrays are less in practice nowadays compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height weight head circumference and arm span A few other studies and practices with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5 to 11yearolds and the controversial hypotheses of lefthanders being maturationally delayed compared to righthanders A study by Eaton Chipperfield Ritchot and Kostiuk in 1996 found in three different samples that there was no difference between right and lefthanders Memory development Researchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onward According to fuzzytrace theory a theory of cognition originally proposed by Valerie F Reyna and Charles Brainerd people have two separate memory processes verbatim and gist These two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different pace Children as young as four years old have verbatim memory memory for surface information which increases up to early adulthood at which point it begins to decline On the other hand our capacity for gist memory memory for semantic information increases up to early adulthood at which point it is consistent through old age Furthermore ones reliance on gist memory traces increases as one ages Research methods and designs Main research methods Developmental psychology employs many of the research methods used in other areas of psychology However infants and children cannot be tested in the same ways as adults so different methods are often used to study their development Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time Common research methods include systematic observation including naturalistic observation or structured observation selfreports which could be clinical interviews or structured interviews clinical or case study method and ethnography or participant observation 3135 These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions and how they construct ideas about which variables to study Every developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the experimental correlational or case study approach The experimental method involves actual manipulation of various treatments circumstances or events to which the participant or subject is exposed the experimental design points to causeandeffect relationships This method allows for strong inferences to be made of causal relationships between the manipulation of one or more independent variables and subsequent behavior as measured by the dependent variable The advantage of using this research method is that it permits determination of causeandeffect relationships among variables On the other hand the limitation is that data obtained in an artificial environment may lack generalizability The correlational method explores the relationship between two or more events by gathering information about these variables without researcher intervention The advantage of using a correlational design is that it estimates the strength and direction of relationships among variables in the natural environment however the limitation is that it does not permit determination of causeandeffect relationships among variables The case study approach allows investigations to obtain an indepth understanding of an individual participant by collecting data based on interviews structured questionnaires observations and test scores Each of these methods have its strengths and weaknesses but the experimental method when appropriate is the preferred method of developmental scientists because it provides a controlled situation and conclusions to be drawn about causeandeffect relationships Research designs Most developmental studies regardless of whether they employ the experimental correlational or case study method can also be constructed using research designs Research designs are logical frameworks used to make key comparisons within research studies such as crosssectional design longitudinal design sequential design microgenetic design In a longitudinal study a researcher observes many individuals born at or around the same time a cohort and carries out new observations as members of the cohort age This method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal or normative and occur in most members of a cohort As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families Researchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their data Longitudinal studies often require large amounts of time and funding making them unfeasible in some situations Also because members of a cohort all experience historical events unique to their generation apparently normative developmental trends may in fact be universal only to their cohort 40 In a crosssectional study a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time This generally requires fewer resources than the longitudinal method and because the individuals come from different cohorts shared historical events are not so much of a confounding factor By the same token however crosssectional research may not be the most effective way to study differences between participants as these differences may result not from their different ages but from their exposure to different historical events 41 A third study design the sequential design combines both methodologies Here a researcher observes members of different birth cohorts at the same time and then tracks all participants over time charting changes in the groups While much more resourceintensive the format aids in a clearer distinction between what changes can be attributed to an individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal 42 Because every method has some weaknesses developmental psychologists rarely rely on one study or even one method to reach conclusions by finding consistent evidence from as many converging sources as possible Life stages of psychological development Prenatal development Prenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological development The whole prenatal development involves three main stages germinal stage embryonic stage and fetal stage Germinal stage begins at conception until 2 weeks embryonic stage means the development from 2 weeks to 8 weeks fetal stage represents 9 weeks until birth of the baby The senses develop in the womb itself a fetus can both see and hear by the second trimester 13 to 24 weeks of age The sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage 5 to 8 weeks 97 Most of the brains billions of neurons also are developed by the second trimester 100 Babies are hence born with some odor taste and sound preferences largely related to the mothers environment 101 Some primitive reflexes too arise before birth and are still present in newborns One hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life Piagets theory of cognitive development suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor development For example the tonic neck reflex may help development by bringing objects into the infants field of view Other reflexes such as the walking reflex appear to be replaced by more sophisticated voluntary control later in infancy This may be because the infant gains too much weight after birth to be strong enough to use the reflex or because the reflex and subsequent development are functionally different It has also been suggested that some reflexes for example the moro and walking reflexes are predominantly adaptations to life in the womb with little connection to early infant development Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions such as neurological conditions like dementia or traumatic lesions Ultrasounds have shown that infants are capable of a range of movements in the womb many of which appear to be more than simple reflexes By the time they are born infants can recognize and have a preference for their mothers voice suggesting some prenatal development of auditory perception Prenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders for example in schizophrenia With the advent of cognitive neuroscience embryology and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology research Several environmental agentsteratogenscan cause damage during the prenatal period These include prescription and nonprescription drugs illegal drugs tobacco alcohol environmental pollutants infectious disease agents such as the rubella virus and the toxoplasmosis parasite maternal malnutrition maternal emotional stress and Rh factor blood incompatibility between mother and child 102115 There are many statistics which prove the effects of the aforementioned substances A leading example of this would be that at least 100000 cocaine babies were born in the United States annually in the late 1980s Cocaine babies are proven to have quite severe and lasting difficulties which persist throughout infancy and right throughout childhood The drug also encourages behavioural problems in the affected children and defects of various vital organs Infancy From birth until the first year children are referred to as infants As they grow children respond to their environment in unique ways Developmental psychologists vary widely in their assessment of infant psychology and the influence the outside world has upon it The majority of a newborn infants time is spent sleeping At first their sleep cycles are evenly spread throughout the day and night but after a couple of months infants generally become diurnal In human or rodent infants there is always the observation of a diurnal cortisol rhythm which is sometimes entrained with a maternal substance Nevertheless the circadian rhythm starts to take shape and a 24hour rhythm is observed in just some few months after birth Infants can be seen to have six states grouped into pairs quiet sleep and active sleep dreaming when REM sleep occurs Generally there are various reasons as to why infants dream Some argue that it is just a psychotherapy which usually occurs normally in the brain Dreaming is a form of processing and consolidating information that has been obtained during the day Freud argues that dreams are a way of representing unconscious desires quiet waking and active waking fussing and crying In a normal set up infants have different reasons as to why they cry Mostly infants cry due to physical discomfort hunger or to receive attention or stimulation from their caregiver Infant perception Infant perception is what a newborn can see hear smell taste and touch These five features are considered as the five senses Because of these different senses infants respond to stimuli differently Vision is significantly worse in infants than in older children Infant sight tends to be blurry in early stages but improves over time Color perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months using habituation methods Infants attain adultlike vision at about six months 191 Hearing is welldeveloped prior to birth Newborns prefer complex sounds to pure tones human speech to other sounds mothers voice to other voices and the native language to other languages Scientist believe these features are probably learned in the womb 151 Infants are fairly good at detecting the direction a sound comes from and by 18 months their hearing ability is approximately equal to an adults Smell and taste are present with infants showing different expressions of disgust or pleasure when presented with pleasant odors honey milk etc or unpleasant odors rotten egg and tastes eg sour taste Newborns are born with odor and taste preferences acquired in the womb from the smell and taste of amniotic fluid in turn influenced by what the mother eats Both breast and bottlefed babies around three days old prefer the smell of human milk to that of formula indicating an innate preference 150 Older infants also prefer the smell of their mother to that of others Touch and feel is one of the betterdeveloped senses at birth as it is one of the first senses to develop inside the womb This is evidenced by the primitive reflexes described above and the relatively advanced development of the somatosensory cortex Pain Infants feel pain similarly if not more strongly than older children but pain relief in infants has not received so much attention as an area of research Glucose is known to relieve pain in newborns Language Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages 189 Infants of around six months can differentiate between phonemes in their own language but not between similar phonemes in another language Notably infants are able to differentiate between various durations and sound levels and can easily differentiate all the languages they have encountered hence easy for infants to understand a certain language compared to an adult At this stage infants also start to babble whereby they start making vowel consonant sound as they try to understand the true meaning of language and copy whatever they are hearing in their surrounding producing their own phonemes In various cultures a distinct form of speech called babytalk is used when communicating with newborns and young children This register consists of simplified terms for common topics such as family members food hygiene and familiar animals It also exhibits specific phonological patterns such as substituting alveolar sounds with initial velar sounds especially in languages like English Furthermore babytalk often involves morphological simplifications such as regularizing verb conjugations for instance saying corned instead of cornered or goed instead of went This language is typically taught to children and is perceived as their natural way of communication Interestingly in mythology and popular culture certain characters such as the Hausa trickster or the Warner Bros cartoon character Tweety Pie are portrayed as speaking in a babytalklike manner Infant cognition the Piagetian era Piaget suggested that an infants perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development which was required for the infant to link visual tactile and motor representations of objects The concept of object permanence refers to the knowledge that an object exists even when it is not directly perceived or visible in other words something is still there even if it is not visible This is a crucial developmental milestone for infants who learn that something is not necessarily lost forever just because it is hidden When a child displays object permanence they will look for a toy that is hidden showing that they are aware that the item is still there even when it is covered by a blanket Most babies start to exhibit symptoms of object permanence around the age of eight months According to this theory infants develop object permanence through touching and handling objects Piagets sensorimotor stage comprised six substages see sensorimotor stages for more detail In the early stages development arises out of movements caused by primitive reflexes Discovery of new behaviors results from classical and operant conditioning and the formation of habits From eight months the infant is able to uncover a hidden object but will persevere when the object is moved Piaget concluded that infants lacked object permanence before 18 months when infants before this age failed to look for an object where it had last been seen Instead infants continued to look for an object where it was first seen committing the AnotB error Some researchers have suggested that before the age of 89 months infants inability to understand object permanence extends to people which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone Out of sight out of mind Recent findings in infant cognition In the 1980s and 1990s researchers developed new methods of assessing infants understanding of the world with far more precision and subtlety than Piaget was able to do in his time Since then many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thought Based on recent findings some researchers such as Elizabeth Spelke and Renee Baillargeon have proposed that an understanding of object permanence is not learned at all but rather comprises part of the innate cognitive capacities of our species According to Jean Piagets developmental psychology object permanence or the awareness that objects exist even when they are no longer visible was thought to emerge gradually between the ages of 8 and 12 months However experts such as Elizabeth Spelke and Renee Baillargeon have questioned this notion They studied infants comprehension of object permanence at a young age using novel experimental approaches such as violationofexpectation paradigms These findings imply that children as young as 3 to 4 months old may have an innate awareness of object permanence Baillargeons drawbridge experiment for example showed that infants were surprised when they saw occurrences that contradicted object permanence expectations This proposition has important consequences for our understanding of infant cognition implying that infants may be born with core cognitive abilities rather than developing them via experience and learning Other research has suggested that young infants in their first six months of life may possess an understanding of numerous aspects of the world around them including an early numerical cognition that is an ability to represent number and even compute the outcomes of addition and subtraction operations an ability to infer the goals of people in their environment an ability to engage in simple causal reasoning Critical periods of development There are critical periods in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual sensorimotor social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulation Feral children such as Genie deprived of adequate stimulation fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood In this case Genie is used to represent the case of a feral child because she was socially neglected and abused while she was just a young girl She underwent abnormal child psychology which involved problems with her linguistics This happened because she was neglected while she was very young with no one to care about her and had less human contact The concept of critical periods is also wellestablished in neurophysiology from the work of Hubel and Wiesel among others Neurophysiology in infants generally provides correlating details that exists between neurophysiological details and clinical features and also focuses on vital information on rare and common neurological disorders that affect infants Developmental delays Studies have been done to look at the differences in children who have developmental delays versus typical development Normally when being compared to one another mental age MA is not taken into consideration There still may be differences in developmentally delayed DD children vs typical development TD behavioral emotional and other mental disorders When compared to MA children there is a bigger difference between normal developmental behaviors overall DDs can cause lower MA so comparing DDs with TDs may not be as accurate Pairing DDs specifically with TD children at similar MA can be more accurate There are levels of behavioral differences that are considered as normal at certain ages When evaluating DDs and MA in children consider whether those with DDs have a larger amount of behavior that is not typical for their MA group Developmental delays tend to contribute to other disorders or difficulties than their TD counterparts Toddlerhood Infants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood In this stage an infants transition into toddlerhood is highlighted through selfawareness developing maturity in language use and presence of memory and imagination During toddlerhood babies begin learning how to walk talk and make decisions for themselves An important characteristic of this age period is the development of language where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds babbling and eventually words Selfcontrol also begins to develop At this age children take initiative to explore experiment and learn from making mistakes Caretakers who encourage toddlers to try new things and test their limits help the child become autonomous selfreliant and confident If the caretaker is overprotective or disapproving of independent actions the toddler may begin to doubt their abilities and feel ashamed of the desire for independence The childs autonomic development is inhibited leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future Toddlers also begin to identify themselves in gender roles acting according to their perception of what a man or woman should do Socially the period of toddlerhood is commonly called the terrible twos Toddlers often use their newfound language abilities to voice their desires but are often misunderstood by parents due to their language skills just beginning to develop A person at this stage testing their independence is another reason behind the stages infamous label Tantrums in a fit of frustration are also common Childhood Erik Erikson divides childhood into four stages each with its distinct social crisis Stage 1 Infancy 0 to 1 in which the psychosocial crisis is Trust vs Mistrust Stage 2 Early childhood 2 to 3 in which the psychosocial crisis is Autonomy vs Shame and doubt Stage 3 Play age 3 to 5 in which the psychosocial crisis is Initiative vs Guilt This stage is also called the preschool age exploratory age and toy age Stage 4 School age 5 to 12 in which the psychosocial crisis is Industry vs Inferiority Infancy As stated the psychosocial crisis for Erikson is Trust versus Mistrust Needs are the foundation for gaining or losing trust in the infant If the needs are met trust in the guardian and the world forms If the needs are not met or the infant is neglected mistrust forms alongside feelings of anxiety and fear Early Childhood Autonomy versus shame follows trust in infancy The child begins to explore their world in this stage and discovers preferences in what they like If autonomy is allowed the child grows in independence and their abilities If freedom of exploration is hindered it leads to feelings of shame and low selfesteem Play or preschool ages 35 In the earliest years children are completely dependent on the care of others Therefore they develop a social relationship with their care givers and later with family members During their preschool years 35 they enlarge their social horizons to include people outside the family Preoperational and then operational thinking develops which means actions are reversible and egocentric thought diminishes The motor skills of preschoolers increase so they can do more things for themselves They become more independent No longer completely dependent on the care of others the world of this age group expands More people have a role in shaping their individual personalities Preschoolers explore and question their world For Jean Piaget the child is a little scientist exploring and reflecting on these explorations to increase competence and this is done in a very independent way 7 9 Play is a major activity for ages 35 For Piaget through play a child reaches higher levels of cognitive development 14 In their expanded world children in the 35 age group attempt to find their own way If this is done in a socially acceptable way the child develops the initiative If not the child develops guilt Children who develop guilt rather than initiative have failed Eriksons psychosocial crisis for the 35 age group Middle and Late childhood ages 612 For Erik Erikson the psychosocial crisis during middle childhood is Industry vs Inferiority which if successfully met instills a sense of Competency in the child In all cultures middle childhood is a time for developing skills that will be needed in their society School offers an arena in which children can gain a view of themselves as industrious and worthy They are graded for their school work and often for their industry They can also develop industry outside of school in sports games and doing volunteer work Children who achieve success in school or games might develop a feeling of competence The peril during this period is that feelings of inadequacy and inferiority will develop Parents and teachers can undermine a childs development by failing to recognize accomplishments or being overly critical of a childs efforts Children who are encouraged and praised develop a belief in their competence Lack of encouragement or ability to excel lead to feelings of inadequacy and inferiority The Centers for Disease Control CDC divides Middle Childhood into two stages 68 years and 911 years and gives developmental milestones for each stage Middle Childhood 68 Entering elementary school children in this age group begin to thinks about the future and their place in the world Working with other students and wanting their friendship and acceptance become more important This leads to more independence from parents and family As students they develop the mental and verbal skills to describe experiences and talk about thoughts and feelings They become less selfcentered and show more concern for others Late Childhood 912 For children ages 911 friendships and peer relationships increase in strength complexity and importance This results in greater peer pressure They grow even less dependent on their families and they are challenged academically To meet this challenge they increase their attention span and learn to see other points of view Adolescence Adolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role such as worker parent andor citizen It is the period known for the formation of personal and social identity see Erik Erikson and the discovery of moral purpose see William Damon Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning A return to egocentric thought often occurs early in the period Only 35 develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood Huitt W and Hummel J January 1998 Erik Erikson labels this stage identity versus role confusion Erikson emphasizes the importance of developing a sense of identity in adolescence because it affects the individual throughout their life Identity is a lifelong process and is related with curiosity and active engagement Role confusion is often considered the current state of identity of the individual Identity exploration is the process of changing from role confusion to resolution During Erik Eriksons identity versus role uncertainty stage which occurs in adolescence people struggle to form a cohesive sense of self while exploring many social roles and prospective life routes This time is characterized by deep introspection selfexamination and the pursuit of selfunderstanding Adolescents are confronted with questions regarding their identity beliefs and future goals The major problem is building a strong sense of identity in the face of society standards peer pressure and personal preferences Adolescents participate in identity exploration commitment and synthesis actively seeking out new experiences embracing ideals and aspirations and merging their changing sense of self into a coherent identity Successfully navigating this stage builds the groundwork for good psychological development in adulthood allowing people to pursue meaningful relationships make positive contributions to society and handle lifes adversities with perseverance and purpose It is divided into three parts namely Early Adolescence 9 to 13 years Mid Adolescence 13 to 15 years and Late Adolescence 15 to 18 years The adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as Who am I Who do I want to be Like toddlers adolescents must explore test limits become autonomous and commit to an identity or sense of self Different roles behaviors and ideologies must be tried out to select an identity Role confusion and inability to choose vocation can result from a failure to achieve a sense of identity through for example friends Early adulthood Early adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 18 to 39 and according to theorists such as Erik Erikson is a stage where development is mainly focused on maintaining relationships Erikson shows the importance of relationships by labeling this stage intimacy vs isolation Intimacy suggests a process of becoming part of something larger than oneself by sacrificing in romantic relationships and working for both life and career goals Other examples include creating bonds of intimacy sustaining friendships and starting a family Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages A sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to develop If this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation isolation a fear of commitment and the inability to depend on others Isolation on the other hand suggests something different than most might expect Erikson defined it as a delay of commitment in order to maintain freedom Yet this decision does not come without consequences Erikson explained that choosing isolation may affect ones chances of getting married progressing in a career and overall development A related framework for studying this part of the lifespan is that of emerging adulthood Scholars of emerging adulthood such as Jeffrey Arnett are not necessarily interested in relationship development Instead this concept suggests that people transition after their teenage years into a period not characterized as relationship building and an overall sense of constancy with life but with years of living with parents phases of selfdiscovery and experimentation Middle adulthood Middle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 40 to 64 During this period middleaged adults experience a conflict between generativity and stagnation Generativity is the sense of contributing to society the next generation or their immediate community On the other hand stagnation results in a lack of purpose The adults identity continues to develop in middleadulthood Middleaged adults often adopt opposite gender characeristics The adult realizes they are halfway through their life and often reevaluate vocational and social roles Life circumstances can also cause a reexamination of identity Physically the middleaged experience a decline in muscular strength reaction time sensory keenness and cardiac output Also women experience menopause at an average age of 488 and a sharp drop in the hormone estrogen Men experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopause Andropause in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal females As men age lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in sperm count Sexual responsiveness can also be affected including delays in erection and longer periods of penile stimulation required to achieve ejaculation The important influence of biological and social changes experienced by women and men in middle adulthood is reflected in the fact that depression is highest at age 485 around the world Old age The World Health Organization finds no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old Most developed countries set the age as 65 or 70 However in developing countries inability to make active contribution to society not chronological age marks the beginning of old age According to Eriksons stages of psychosocial development old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their lives Erikson labels this stage as integrity versus despair For integrated persons there is a sense of fulfillment in life They have become selfaware and optimistic due to lifes commitments and connection to others While reflecting on life people in this stage develop feelings of contentment with their experiences If a person falls into despair they are often disappointed about failures or missed chances in life They may feel that the time left in life is an insufficient amount to turn things around Physically older people experience a decline in muscular strength reaction time stamina hearing distance perception and the sense of smell They also are more susceptible to diseases such as cancer and pneumonia due to a weakened immune system Programs aimed at balance muscle strength and mobility have been shown to reduce disability among mildly but not more severely disabled elderly Sexual expression depends in large part upon the emotional and physical health of the individual Many older adults continue to be sexually active and satisfied with their sexual activity Mental disintegration may also occur leading to dementia or ailments such as Alzheimers disease The average age of onset for dementia in males is 788 and 819 for women It is generally believed that crystallized intelligence increases up to old age while fluid intelligence decreases with age Whether or not normal intelligence increases or decreases with age depends on the measure and study Longitudinal studies show that perceptual speed inductive reasoning and spatial orientation decline An article on adult cognitive development reports that crosssectional studies show that some abilities remained stable into early old age Parenting Parenting variables alone have typically accounted for 20 to 50 percent of the variance in child outcomes All parents have their own parenting styles Parenting styles according to Kimberly Kopko are based upon two aspects of parenting behavior control and warmth Parental control refers to the degree to which parents manage their childrens behavior Parental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive to their childrens behavior Parenting styles The following parenting styles have been described in the child development literature Authoritative parenting is characterized as parents who have high parental warmth responsiveness and demandingness but rate low in negativity and conflict These parents are assertive but not intrusive or overly restrictive This method of parenting is associated with more positive social and academic outcomes The beneficial outcomes of authoritative parenting are not necessarily universal Among African American adolescents authoritative parenting is not associated with academic achievement without peer support for achievement Children who are raised by authoritative parents are more likely to become independent selfreliant socially accepted academically successful and wellbehaved They are less likely to report depression and anxiety and less likely to engage in antisocial behavior like delinquency and drug use Authoritarian parenting is characterized by low levels of warmth and responsiveness with high levels of demandingness and firm control These parents focus on obedience and they monitor their children regularly In general this style of parenting is associated with maladaptive outcomes The outcomes are more harmful for middleclass boys than girls preschool white girls than preschool black girls and for white boys than Hispanic boys Permissive parenting is characterized by high levels of responsiveness combined with low levels of demandingness These parents are lenient and do not necessarily require mature behavior They allow for a high degree of selfregulation and typically avoid confrontation Compared to children raised using the authoritative style preschool girls raised in permissive families are less assertive Additionally preschool children of both sexes are less cognitively competent than those children raised under authoritative parenting styles Rejecting or neglectful parenting is characterized by low levels of demandingness and responsiveness These parents are usually unsupportive unstructured and disinterested in their childrens lives Low degrees of reactivity and demandingness are characteristics of this parenting style Children in this category are typically the least competent of all the categories Mother and father factors Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the mother Recent literature however has looked toward the father as having an important role in child development Affirming a role for fathers studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their father In particular a study in the US and New Zealand found the presence of the natural father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls Furthermore another argument is that neither a mother nor a father is actually essential in successful parenting and that single parents as well as homosexual couples can support positive child outcomes According to this set of research children need at least one consistently responsible adult with whom the child can have a positive emotional connection Having more than one of these figures contributes to a higher likelihood of positive child outcomes Divorce Another parental factor often debated in terms of its effects on child development is divorce Divorce in itself is not a determining factor of negative child outcomes In fact the majority of children from divorcing families fall into the normal range on measures of psychological and cognitive functioning A number of mediating factors play a role in determining the effects divorce has on a child for example divorcing families with young children often face harsher consequences in terms of demographic social and economic changes than do families with older children Positive coparenting after divorce is part of a pattern associated with positive child coping while hostile parenting behaviors lead to a destructive pattern leaving children at risk Additionally direct parental relationship with the child also affects the development of a child after a divorce Overall protective factors facilitating positive child development after a divorce are maternal warmth positive fatherchild relationship and cooperation between parents Crosscultural A way to improve developmental psychology is a representation of crosscultural studies The psychology field in general assumes that basic human developments are represented in any population specifically the WesternEducatedIndustrializedRich and Democratic WEIRD subjects that are relied on for a majority of their studies Previous research generalizes the findings done with WEIRD samples because many in the Psychological field assume certain aspects of development are exempted from or are not affected by life experiences However many of the assumptions have been proven incorrect or are not supported by empirical research For example according to Kohlberg moral reasoning is dependent on cognitive abilities While both analytical and holistic cognitive systems do have the potential to develop in any adult the West is still on the extreme end of analytical thinking and the nonWest tend to use holistic processes Furthermore moral reasoning in the West only considers aspects that support autonomy and the individual whereas nonWestern adults emphasize moral behaviors supporting the community and maintaining an image of holiness or divinity Not all aspects of human development are universal and we can learn a lot from observing different regions and subjects Indian model of human development An example of a nonWestern model for development stages is the Indian model focusing a large amount of its psychological research on morality and interpersonal progress The developmental stages in Indian models are founded by Hinduism which primarily teaches stages of life in the process of someone discovering their fate or Dharma This crosscultural model can add another perspective to psychological development in which the West behavioral sciences have not emphasized kinship ethnicity or religion Indian psychologists study the relevance of attentive families during the early stages of life The early life stages conceptualize a different parenting style from the West because it does not try to rush children out of dependency The family is meant to help the child grow into the next developmental stage at a particular age This way when children finally integrate into society they are interconnected with those around them and reach renunciation when they are older Children are raised in joint families so that in early childhood ages 6 months to 2 years the other family members help gradually wean the child from its mother During ages 2 to 5 the parents do not rush toilet training Instead of training the child to perform this behavior the child learns to do it as they mature at their own pace This model of early human development encourages dependency unlike Western models that value autonomy and independence By being attentive and not forcing the child to become independent they are confident and have a sense of belonging by late childhood and adolescence This stage in life 515 years is also when children start education and increase their knowledge of Dharma It is within early and middle adulthood that we see moral development progress Early middle and late adulthood are all concerned with caring for others and fulfilling Dharma The main distinction between early adulthood to middle or late adulthood is how far their influence reaches Early adulthood emphasizes the importance of fulfilling the immediate family needs until later adulthood when they broaden their responsibilities to the general public The oldage life stage development reaches renunciation or a complete understanding of Dharma The current mainstream views in the psychological field are against the Indian model for human development The criticism against such models is that the parenting style is overly protective and encourages too much dependency It focuses on interpersonal instead of individual goals Also there are some overlaps and similarities between Eriksons stages of human development and the Indian model but both of them still have major differences The West prefers Ericksons ideas over the Indian model because they are supported by scientific studies The life cycles based on Hinduism are not as favored because it is not supported with research and it focuses on the ideal human development See also Journals References Further reading External links Media related to Developmental psychology at Wikimedia Commons The Society for Research in

    title: "Sports psychology",
    originalContent:
      "Sport psychology is defined as the study of the psychological basis processes and effects of sport Sport is defined as any physical activity where the individuals engage for competition and health Sport psychology is recognized as an interdisciplinary science that draws on knowledge from many related fields including biomechanics physiology kinesiology and psychology It involves the study of how psychological factors affect performance and how participation in sport and exercise affect psychological social and physical factors Sport psychologists teach cognitive and behavioral strategies to athletes in order to improve their experience and performance in sports A sport psychologist does not focus solely on athletes This type of professional also helps nonathletes and everyday exercisers learn how to enjoy sports and stick to an exercise program A psychologist is someone that helps with the mental and emotional aspects of someones state so a sport psychologist would help people in regales to sports but also just physical activity In addition to instruction and training of psychological skills for performance improvement applied sport psychology may include work with athletes coaches and parents regarding injury rehabilitation communication team building and postathletic career transitions A sport psychologist would also work on helping athletes and nonathletes alike to cope manage and improve their overall health not only related to performance but also in how these events and their exercise or sport affects the different areas of their lives social interactions relationships mental illnesses and other relevant areas History of sport psychology Early history In its formation sport psychology was primarily the domain of physical educators not researchers which can explain the lack of a consistent history Nonetheless many instructors sought to explain the various phenomena associated with physical activity and developed sport psychology laboratories The history of sport psychology dates back to almost 200 years ago with Carl Friedrich Kochs 1830 publication of Calisthenics from the Viewpoint of Dietetics and Psychology The first psychology laboratory was established back in 1879 by Wilhelm Wundt this is where the first experiments of sport psychology were first conducted In 1884 early research on muscular endurance and hypnosis was conduct by Konrad Rieger Angelo Moss also worked on mental fatigue and physical performance in 1891 The term sport psychology was first used back in 1900 by Pierre de Coubertin The field saw notably contributions from the pioneers in Wundt and de Coubertin in the early 1900s The birth of sport psychology in Europe happened largely in Germany The first sport psychology laboratory was founded by Dr Carl Diem in Berlin in the early 1920s The early years of sport psychology were also highlighted by the formation of the Deutsche Hochschule fr Leibesbungen College of Physical Education in Berlin Germany by Robert Werner Schulte in 1920 The lab measured physical abilities and aptitude in sport and in 1921 Schulte published Body and Mind in Sport In Russia sport psychology experiments began as early as 1925 at institutes of physical culture in Moscow and Leningrad and formal sport psychology departments were formed around 1930 However it was a bit later during the Cold War period 19461989 that numerous sport science programs were formed due to the military competitiveness between the Soviet Union and the United States and as a result of attempts to increase the Olympic medal numbers The Americans felt that their sport performances were inadequate and very disappointing compared to the ones of the Soviets so this led them to invest more in the methods that could ameliorate their athletes performance and made them have a greater interest on the subject The advancement of sport psychology was more deliberate in the Soviet Union and the Eastern countries due to the creation of sports institutes where sport psychologists played an important role In North America early years of sport psychology included isolated studies of motor behavior social facilitation and habit formation During the 1890s E W Scripture conducted a range of behavioral experiments including measuring the reaction time of runners thought time in school children and the accuracy of an orchestra conductors baton Despite Scriptures previous experiments the first recognized sport psychology study was carried out by an American psychologist Norman Triplett in 1898 The work of Norman Triplett demonstrated that bicyclists were more likely to cycle faster with a pacemaker or a competitor which has been foundational in the literature of social psychology and social facilitation He wrote about his findings in what was regarded as the first scientific paper on sport psychology titled The Dynamogenic Factors in Pacemaking and Competition which was published in 1898 in the American Journal of Psychology Lashley and Watson pertaining to the learning curve present in archery provided a template for future habit forming research as their work proved that humans have a higher level of motivation to achieve a task such as archery in comparison to a mundane task Researchers Albert Johanson and Joseph Holmes tested baseball player Babe Ruth in 1921 as reported by sportswriter Hugh S Fullerton Ruths swing speed his breathing right before hitting a baseball his coordination and rapidity of wrist movement and his reaction time were all measured with the researchers concluding that Ruths talent could be attributed in part to motor skills and reflexes that were well above those of the average person The field of sport psychology in general began in the 1960s with the formation of the International Society of Sport Psychology in 1965 The North American Society for the Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity in 1967 and The Canadian Society for Psychomotor Learning and Sport Psychology in 1969 Sport psychology started in 1890 when Norman Triplett performed the first experiment in sport psychology and the social facilitation phenomenon Then 1925 Coleman Griffith created the Athletic Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois Later in 1930 the Soviet Union employed sport psychology during the Cold War In 1960 sport psychology becomes part of the US and expanded to the whole world In 1986 the American Psychological Association recognized Sport psychology as a branch of Psychology and in 1993 British Psychology Society formed a sport and exercise psychology section Studies such as Johanson and Holmes test on Ruth were foundational in the establishment of the importance of sport psychology as a field both in the eye of the public and the scientific community Characteristics of behavioral sport psychology The first characteristic of behavioral sport psychology involves identifying target behaviors of athletes and coaches to be improved defining those behaviors in a way so that they can be reliably measured and using changes in the behavioral measure as the best indicator of the extent to which the recipient of an intervention is being helped Martin 2011 A second characteristic is that behavioral psychology treatment procedures and techniques are based on the principles and procedures of Pavlovian or respondent and operant conditioning and are ways of rearranging the stimuli that occur as antecedents and consequences of an athletes behavior The third characteristic is that many of the interventions with athletes have been developed by practitioners with a cognitivebehavioral orientation Cognitivebehavior therapy typically focuses on cognitive processes frequently referred to as believing thinking expecting and perceiving The fourth characteristic is that researchers have relied heavily on the use of singlesubject research designs to evaluate interventions in sport settings including the following a a focus on individual athletic performance across several practices and competitions b acceptability by athletes and coaches because no control group is needed few participants are needed and sooner or later all participants receive the intervention c easy adaptability to assess a variety of interventions in practices and competitions and d effectiveness assessed through direct measures of sportspecific behaviors or outcomes of behaviors The fifth characteristic of a behavioral approach is to place a high value on accountability for everyone involved in the design implementation and evaluation of an intervention Martin Pear 2011 Social validation in sport psychology In ABA the term social validation refers to procedures to ensure that the techniques employed by a practitioner are selected and applied in the best interests of the clients In behavioral sport psychology social validation requires that the practitioner constantly seek answers to three questions a What do the athletes and perhaps the coach and parents think about the goals of the intervention b What do they think about the procedures recommended by the practitioner c What do they think about the results produced by those procedures Behavior sport psychologists need to be aware of and behave consistently with the set of ethical principles to guide the actions of sport psychologists published in 1995 by the Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology which in 2006 became the Association for Applied Sport Psychology AASP These principles of ethics exist with the primary goal of the welfare and protection of individuals groups and the public with which the AASP members work The AASP members make a lifelong commitment to act ethically themselves encourage ethical behavior in others and consult with others as needed on ethical concerns Skill acquisition Each sport requires different range of skills Knapp 1963 defined skills as the learned ability to bring predetermined results with maximum certainty often with the minimum outlay of time energy or both As we develop a skill the error is diminished An ability describes our innate physical attributes that determine our potential for a given sport Skill acquisition engages experts of their fields neuroscience physiology biomechanics etc to conduct research on how the neuromuscular system functions to activate and coordinate the muscles in the performance of a motor skill Skill acquisition has evolved from a subfield of psychology to taking on its own interpretation of the brainbehavior theories Coleman Griffith Americas first sport psychologist Coleman Griffith worked as an American professor of educational psychology at the University of Illinois where he first performed comprehensive research and applied sport psychology He performed causal studies on vision and attention of basketball and soccer players and was interested in their reaction times muscular tension and relaxation and mental awareness Griffith began his work in 1925 studying the psychology of sport at the University of Illinois funded by the Research in Athletics Laboratory Until the laboratorys closing in 1932 he conducted research and practiced sport psychology in the field The laboratory was used for the study of sport psychology where different factors that influence athletic performance and the physiological and psychological requirements of sport competitions were investigated He then transmitted his findings to coaches and helped advance the knowledge of psychology and physiology on sports performance Griffith also published two major works during this time The Psychology of Coaching 1926 and The Psychology of Athletics 1928 Coleman Griffith was also the first person to describe the job of sport psychologists and talk about the main tasks that they should be capable of carrying out He mentioned this in his work Psychology and its relation to athletic competition which was published in 1925 One of the tasks was to teach the younger and unskilled coaches the psychological principles that were used by the more successful and experienced coaches The other task was to adapt psychological knowledge to sport and the last task was to use the scientific method and the laboratory for the purpose of discovering new facts and principles that can aid other professionals in the domain In 1938 Griffith returned to the sporting world to serve as a sport psychologist consultant for the Chicago Cubs Hired by Philip Wrigley for 1500 Griffith examined a range of factors such as ability personality leadership skill learning and social psychological factors related to performance Griffith made rigorous analyses of players while also making suggestions for improving practice effectiveness Griffith also made several recommendations to Mr Wrigley including a psychology clinic for managers coaches and senior players Wrigley offered a fulltime position as a sport psychologist to Griffith but he declined the offer to focus on his sons high school education Coleman Griffith made numerous contributions to the field of sport psychology but most notable was his belief that field studies such as athlete and coach interviews could provide a more thorough understanding of how psychological principles play out in competitive situations Griffith devoted himself to rigorous research and also published for both applied and academic audiences noting that the applicability of sport psychology research was equally important with the generation of knowledge Finally Griffith recognized that sport psychology promoted performance enhancement and personal growth In 1923 Griffith developed and taught the first sport psychology university courses Psychology and Athletics at the University of Illinois and he came to be known as The Father of Sport Psychology in the United States as a result of his pioneering achievements in that area However he is also known as The prophet without disciples since none of his students continued with sport psychology and his work started to receive attention only from the 1960s Renewed growth and emergence as a discipline Early researchers Franklin M Henry was a researcher who had a positive influence on sport psychology In 1938 he began to study how different factors in sport psychology can affect athletes motor skills He also investigated how high altitudes can have an effect on exercise and performance aeroembolism and decompression sickness and studies on kinesthetic perception learning of motor skills and neuromuscular reaction were carried out in his laboratory In 1964 he wrote a paper Physical Education An Academic Discipline that helped further advance sport psychology and began to give it its scholarly and scientific shape Additionally he published over 120 articles was a board member of various journals and received many awards and acclaims for his contributions In 1979 Rainer Martens published an article entitled About Smocks and Jocks in which he contended that it was difficult to apply specific laboratory research to sporting situations For instance how can the pressure of shooting a foul shot in front of 12000 screaming fans be duplicated in the lab Martens contended I have grave doubts that isolated psychological studies which manipulate a few variables attempting to uncover the effects of X on Y can be cumulative to form a coherent picture of human behavior I sense that the elegant control achieved in laboratory research is such that all meaning is drained from the experimental situation The external validity of laboratory studies is at best limited to predicting behavior in other laboratories Martens urged researchers to get out of the laboratory and onto the field to meet athletes and coaches on their own turf Martens article spurred an increased interest in qualitative research methods in sport psychology such as the seminal article Mental Links to Excellence The first sport psychology organizations Given the relatively free travel of information amongst European practitioners sport psychology flourished first in Europe where in 1965 a meeting was organized by Ferruccio Antonelli a sport psychologist living in Italy The meeting was held in Rome Italy and some 450 professionals primarily from Europe Australia and the Americas attended It became known as the First World Congress of Sport Psychology and gave rise to the International Society of Sport Psychology ISSP The ISSP became a prominent sport psychology organization after the Third World Congress of Sport Psychology in 1973 and still exists today as the only international organization that is focused solely on the promotion of sport psychology Additionally the European Federation of Sport Psychology or FEPSAC Fdration Europenne de Psychologie des Sports et des Activits Corporelles was formed following a similar meeting known as the first European Congress of sport in 1969 and has since held 15 congresses to discuss the future of sport psychology in Europe In North America support for sport psychology grew out of physical education and In 1973 The North American Society for the Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity NASPSPA grew from being an interest group to a fullfledged organization whose mission included promoting the research and teaching of motor behavior and the psychology of sport and exercise In Canada the Canadian Society for Psychomotor Learning and Sport Psychology SCAPPS was founded in 1977 to promote the study and exchange of ideas in the fields of motor behavior and sport psychology These two organizations would go on to be the leading sources of collaboration among scientists in sport psychology and in 1985 the NASPSPA became the first organization in North America to sponsor a journal in sport psychology when the previously unaffiliated The Journal of Sport Psychology which was founded in 1979 became The Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology Also during this same time period over 500 members of the American Psychological Association APA signed a petition to create Division 47 in 1986 which is focused on the collaboration between researchers in the field of Exercise and Sport Psychology In 1985 several applied sport psychology practitioners headed by John Silva believed an organization was needed to focus on professional issues in sport psychology and therefore formed the Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology AAASP This was done in response to NASPSPA voting not to address applied issues and to keep their focus on research Following its stated goal of promoting the science and practice of applied sport psychology AAASP quickly worked to develop uniform standards of practice highlighted by the development of an ethical code for its members in the 1990s The development of the AAASP Certified Consultant CCAAASP program helped bring standardization to the training required to practice applied sport psychology and in 2007 AAASP dropped Advancement from its name to become the Association for Applied Sport Psychology AASP as it is currently known AASP AASP aims to provide leadership for the development of theory research and applied practice in sport exercise and health psychology However in 2010 a rift developed between members who would like the organization to function as a trade group that promotes the CCAASP certificate and pushes for job development and those who would prefer the organization to remain as a professional society and a forum to exchange research and practice ideas These problems were illustrated in AASP founding president John Silvas address at the 2010 conference Silva highlighted five points necessary for AASP and the greater field of applied sport psychology to address in the near future Orderly development and advancement of the practice of sport psychology Embrace and enhance interdisciplinary nature of sport psychology Advance development of graduate education and training in sport psychology Advance job opportunities for practice in collegiate Olympic and pro sports Be memberdriven and service its membership Silva then suggested that AASP advance the legal standing of the term sport psychology consultant and adopt one educative model for the collegiate and postgraduate training of sport psychology consultants While the AASP Certified Consultant CCAASP certification provides a legitimate pathway to postgraduate training it does not legally bar an individual without the CCAASP credentials from practicing sport psychology Silva contended that future sport psychology professionals should have degrees in both psychology and the sport sciences and that their training ultimately conclude in the obtainment of a legal title It was argued this should increase the likelihood of clients receiving competent service as practitioners will have received training in both the sport and psychology pieces of sport psychology Silva concluded that AASP and APA work together to create legal protection for the term sport psychology consultant and in 2018 the AASP updated its certification program and launched the Certified Mental Performance Consultant CMPC However as of 2020 no legal status for the required training to practice sport psychology has been obtained by either the AASP or APA Debate over the professionalization of sport psychology Although the AASP has recently dealt with problems regarding the legal requirements for practicing sport psychology there has been debate over the professionalization of sport psychology for quite some time The professionalization of the discipline started to become visible at the Olympic games in 1984 when the Olympic teams began to hire sport psychologists for their athletes and in 1985 when the US team employed their first permanent sport psychologist For the Summer Olympics in 1996 the US already had over 20 sport psychologists working with their athletes Psychological research into sport and exercise was being used to enhance the training regiments of highlevel athletes for the first time As Rainer Martens argued for applied methods in sport psychology research the increasing emergence of practitioners of sport psychology including sport psychology consultants who taught sport psychology skills and principles to athletes and coaches and clinical and counseling psychologists who provided counseling and therapy to athletes brought into focus two key questions and a debate which continues to the present day under what category does the discipline of sport psychology fall and who governs the accepted practices for sport psychology Is sport psychology a branch of kinesiology or sport and exercise science like exercise physiology and athletic training Is it a branch of psychology or counseling Or is it an independent discipline Danish and Hale 1981 contended that many clinical psychologists were using medical models of psychology to problematize sport problems as signs of mental illness instead of drawing upon the empirical knowledge base generated by sport psychology researchers which in many cases indicated that sport problems were not signs of mental illness Danish and Hale proposed that a human development model be used to structure research and applied practice Heyman 1982 urged tolerance for multiple models educative motivational developmental of research and practice while Dishman 1983 countered that the field needed to develop unique sport psychology models instead of borrowing from educational and clinical psychology As the practice of sport psychology expanded throughout the 1980s and 1990s some practitioners expressed concern that the field lacked uniformity and needed consistency to become a good profession The issues of graduate program accreditation and the uniform training of graduate students in sport psychology were considered by some to be necessary to promote the field of sport psychology educate the public on what a sport psychologist does and ensure an open job market for practitioners However Hale and Danish 1999 argued that accreditation of graduate programs was not necessary and did not guarantee uniformity Instead these authors proposed a special practicum in applied sport psychology that included greater contact hours with clients and closer supervision Applied sport psychology today Applied sport and exercise psychology consists of instructing athletes coaches teams exercisers parents fitness professionals groups and other performers on the psychological aspects of their sport or activity The goal of applied practice is to optimize performance and enjoyment through the use of psychological skills and the use of psychometrics and psychological assessment The practice of applied sport psychology is not legally restricted to individuals who possess one type of certification or licensure The subject of what exactly constitutes applied sport psychology and who can practice it has been debated amongst sport psychology professionals and to this day still lacks formal legal resolution in the United States Some question the ability of professionals who possess only sport science or kinesiology training to practice psychology with clients while others counter that clinical and counseling psychologists without training in sport science do not have the professional competency to work with athletes However this debate should not overshadow the reality that many professionals express the desire to work together to promote best practices among all practitioners regardless of training or academic background There are different approaches that a sport psychologist can use while working with his clients For example the socialpsychological approach focuses on the social environment and the individuals personality and on how complex interactions between the two influence behavior The psychophysiological approach focuses on the processes of the brain and their influence on physical activity and the cognitivebehavioral approach analyzes the ways in which individual thoughts determine behavior Generally there are two different types of sport psychologists that focus on athletes with emotional conditions educational and clinical Sport psychology A repeatable process The sport psychology consultation process can be overwhelming However the benefit to great processes is that they are structured and repeatable With the result of sport psychologist generally is a performance improvement This methodology has behaviorist roots and formulates performance as an interactive effect of behavior and the environment Below is a general outline of the Sport Psychology as a repeatable process that prompts behavior modification in the form of performance improvement This general process is tailored based on the specific needs of the athlete and methodology used by the sport psychologist Initial assessment As with all things the beginning sets the stage for success Thus the initial assessment is an important step in the consultation process This is where the sport psychologist meets with the athlete or athletic team to understand the needs and goals Various techniques used during this stage include interviews observations psychological tests Goal setting Based on the assessment the sport psychologist and athlete will collaborate to set achievable goals The goals can be performance related or focused on improving mental skills Goals can even focus on processes the actions strategies and techniques surrounding excellent performance Intervention implementation Although sport psychologist interventions are not standardized there are a few that are common in the field Some of the common interventions include but are not limited to visualization relaxation and breathing selftalk preperformance routines resilience training and team cohesion Resilience training has had some positive experimental outcomes Due to the pressure of competitive nature of sports and the amount of energy it takes to excel ensuring healthy mental wellbeing is paramount Several studies suggest that mental resilience is increased via a reduction of psychological distress Cognitive therapy also has applications related to behavior modification with reference to sports and exercise Cognitive interventions has been suggested to be important in the maintenance of results Becoming aware of negative thought patterns even if not does not bring about significant change is an important preliminary step to improvement Monitoring and adjustment In order to substantiate an athletes or teams improvements progress must be monitored During the monitoring step feedback is provided and the necessary adjustments follow thereafter It is important to remember that this process is a feedback loop operating in a manner that the feedback feeds into adjustments made and vice versa Follow up It is essential that progress or improvements are maintained after changes are implemented and goals are reached up can be a way to end the consultation process but it can also serve as a basis to repeat the consultation process This is a general outline Based on the source and background the above process could vary This process demonstrates the essence of sport psychology its method and how it is used today Four key aspects of sport psychology Social identity is the basis for four specific aspects of sport psychology These aspects are identified below 1 Sports group behavior A persons sense of self adapts and is shaped by the interaction with group behaviors Sense of self is therefore not entirely defined by the individual but the interactions within the group which is a key feature of the sport team dynamic Defining this role of self then is used to assert a place within the success of the group 2 Sports group formation and development Kindship and group membership exists in all sports even running Solidarity comradery and group formation help satisfy peoples social development 3 Sports group support and stress appraisal Social identity is structured within social selfcategorization processes which are developed within support and stress appraisal structures Sport and team stress can be a significant straincausing or copingmechanism development tool 4 Sports group leadership Social identity with the previous three aspects contributes to social leadership development and interactions Advancing beyond transactional theories of leadership sport interactions more intersectional leadership styles Educational sport psychologists Educational sport psychologists emphasize the use of psychological skills training eg goal setting imagery energy management selftalk when working with clients by educating and instructing them on how to use these skills effectively during performance situations The common goal of an educational sport psychologist is performance enhancement by teaching skills to athletes on how to manage the mental factors of sports to maximize potential Sport psychologists also contribute to the performance of athletes by assisting them with challenges they may face as a result of participating in sports These can include recovery from injury plans for sticking to a training regimen or help with dealing with the emotional strain of being in the public eye Clinical sport psychologist Clinical psychologists obtain a doctoral degree in clinical or counseling psychology They meet with athletes that have mental health issues and work to provide the mental health solutions they need both individually and in group settings Areas of expertise are mainly clinical issues which include but are not limited to depression eating disorders and substance abuse If they possess a medical degree they are also able to prescribe medications or other forms of treatment to address clinical issues A nonclinical sport psychologist might refer one of their clients to a clinical psychologist if it is thought that the athlete might need additional help regarding their mental health Many clinical sport psychologists simply apply their clinical expertise to athletes and are limited in their abilities to enhance performance Common areas of study Listed below are broad areas of research in the field This is not a complete list of all topics but rather an overview of the types of issues and concepts sport psychologists study Criticism of the quality assumptions and methods of sport psychology stress research has drawn increasing attention and a flourishing academic debate has evolved regarding the quality of sport research its limitations and future directions Personality One common area of study within sport psychology is the relationship between personality and performance This research focuses on specific personality characteristics and how they are related to performance or other psychological variables There are various personality characteristics that have been found to be consistent among elite athletes These include but are not limited to mental toughness selfefficacy arousal motivation commitment competitiveness and control Mental toughness is a psychological edge that helps one perform at a high level consistently Mentally tough athletes exhibit four characteristics a strong selfbelief confidence in their ability to perform well an internal motivation to be successful the ability to focus ones thoughts and feelings without distraction and composure under pressure Along with mental toughness is the ability to battle adversity and keep striving when performance or results are not always going ones way Adversity measures an individuals ability to navigate loss or misfortune while mental toughness is the capacity to handle stressors or challenges Selfefficacy is a belief that one can successfully perform a specific task In sport selfefficacy has been conceptualized as sportconfidence However efficacy beliefs are specific to a certain task eg I believe I can successfully make both free throws whereas confidence is a more general feeling eg I believe I will have a good game today Arousal refers to ones physiological and cognitive activation While many researchers have explored the relationship between arousal and performance one unifying theory has not yet been developed However research does suggest perception of arousal ie as either good or bad is related to performance Motivation can be defined broadly as the will to perform a given task People who play or perform for internal reasons such as enjoyment and satisfaction are said to be intrinsically motivated while people who play for external reasons such as money or attention from others are extrinsically motivated Commitment refers to the dedication to continuing a sport from early development into a high level of sport expertise Competitiveness is the ability to challenge opponents with an aim of success Control is the ability to separate and focus on different events occurring in ones life both within and outside of athletics Additionally there are specific psychological skills that are ingrained in personality that are possessed at higher levels in elite athletes than the typical person These include arousal regulation goal setting imagery preperformance routines and selftalk According to Hollanders Model 1971 it is thought that personality is made up of three dimensions rolerelated behavior typical responses and psychological core Rolerelated behaviors are the actions that a person exhibits when they are in a certain situation These behaviors change frequently so they are external and dynamic Typical responses are the way a person usually acts as the result of an event A persons psychological core refers to the morals beliefs and values they hold This is not changed under various circumstances so it is internal and constant There are multiple approaches personality and how it is shaped The psychodynamic approach theory explores how the subconscious interacts with the conscience of an individual It proposes that the underlying thoughts feelings and emotions influence how we think and act The subconscious is closely related to experiences of resolution of conflict as a child This theory emphasizes understanding the individual as a whole rather than by each trait This theory does not consider environmental factors that influence behavior The trait approach focuses on the traits that are commonly attributed to an individual and how they influence the way one will act on a normal basis Traits are helpful in predicting usual behavior however they cannot always predispose situational behavior Situational approach suggests that how an individual will act entirely depends on the environment For example if a player acts aggressively on the playing field they might not be this way off the field This theory neglects individual traits and does not consider differences among people Interactional approach theory is a combination of trait and situational approach It suggests that the traits commonly attributed to an individual predispose behavior however these traits will not influence behavior unless the situation calls for it This theory is most commonly used by sport psychologists because it takes into consideration the components of each person and the situation at hand The method of measuring personality involves assessing the traits or typical style of behavior versus state the immediate emotion or behavior in the moment Athletic performance Sport psychology remains influential to athletic performance at all levels The goal of this area of study is to explore what makes athletes perform the way the way they do Athletic performance can be measured by selfreport or objective data eg playerteam statistics Scholars currently prefer the use of selfreports or a combination of subjective and objective measurements due to the many factors which go into athletic performance For example Athletes Subjective Performance Scale ASPS has been developed and validated with objective data players statistics and found to be a reliable tool for assessing athletic performance in team sports Much of the research done on athletic performance has been through metaanalysis reviews These metaanalysis reviews have shown that there is a benefit to using sport psychology techniques to improve an athletes performance Some influences that have been found to be largely beneficial include taskcohesion and selfefficacy Being mentally prepared has proven to help athletes performance however research has shown that elite athletes and coaches will be hesitant to seek out help from a sport psychologist even if they believed it could help There are multiple key recommendations for mental practice which improve sport performance such as practicing imagery and increasing mental and physical repetitions Youth sport Youth sport refers to organized sports programs for children less than 18 years old Researchers in this area focus on the benefits or drawbacks of youth sport participation and how parents impact their childrens experiences of sporting activities There are multiple factors as to why youth sport is studied when researching sport psychology such as life skills burnout parenting behavior and coachs behavior These factors influence whether athletes in youth sport are affected mentally whether that be a positive or a negative Life skills refer to the mental emotional behavioral and social skills and resources developed through sport participation Research in this area focuses on how life skills are developed and transferred from sports to other areas in life eg from tennis to school and on program development and implementation Burnout in sport is typically characterized as having three dimensions emotional exhaustion depersonalization and a reduced sense of accomplishment Athletes who experience burnout may have different contributing factors but the more frequent reasons include perfectionism boredom injuries excessive pressure and overtraining Burnout is studied in many different athletic populations eg coaches but it is a major problem in youth sports and contributes to withdrawal from sport Parenting in youth sport is necessary and critical for young athletes Research on parenting explores behaviors that contribute to or hinder childrens participation For example research suggests children want their parents to provide support and become involved but not give technical advice unless they are wellversed in the sport Excessive demands from parents may also contribute to burnout Coach behavior is a major contributor to how youth athletes experience sports In research directed at coding behavioral styles of coaches it has been found that children are more accurate at perceiving coaching behaviors than the coach This lack of awareness contributes heavily to negative athlete behaviors and burnout Coaching While sport psychologists primarily work with athletes and focus their research on improving athletic performance coaches are another population where intervention can take place Researchers in this area focus on the things coaches can say or do to improve their coaching technique and their athletes performance Motivational climate refers to the situational and environmental factors that influence individuals goals The two major types of motivational climates coaches can create are taskoriented and egooriented While winning is the overall goal of sports competitions regardless of the motivational climate a taskorientation emphasizes building skill improvement giving complete effort and mastering the task at hand ie selfreferenced goals while an egoorientation emphasizes demonstrating superior ability competition and does not promote effort or individual improvement ie otherreferenced goals A taskoriented climate has been found to develop a greater intrinsic selfdetermined motivation in athletes compared to an egooriented climate Additionally an environment with selfimprovement as the primary focus creates greater intrinsic motivation than one with winning as the focus Effective coaching practices explore the best ways coaches can lead and teach their athletes For examples researchers may study the most effective methods for giving feedback rewarding and reinforcing behavior communicating and avoiding selffulfilling prophecies in their athletes Coaches influence motivation of athletes mainly through interactional behavior with athletes Coaches can be perceived by their athletes as autonomysupporting or controlling Autonomysupporting coaches provide structure as well as being involved and caring towards the athletes Coaches that are perceived to be controlling instill less intrinsic motivation in their athletes Motivation is maximized when a coach is perceived to be autonomysupporting while providing a high level of training and instruction Due to these findings interventions that sport psychologist implement are focused in increasing autonomysupportive behaviors of coaches Coaching philosophy refers to a set of beliefs intrinsic to a coach that guide his or her behavior and experience The philosophy should facilitate selfawareness prioritize coaching objectives and be athletecentered Having a philosophy central to the individual will allow a coach to react more efficiently to fastpaced decisions during sports in a systematic and thoughtful way A coach must be selfaware of their own values in order to monitor if these values align with their thoughts and actions Often getting feedback from trusted outside sources is helpful in developing this selfawareness A coach must also determine and prioritize coaching objectives between winning athlete wellbeing and time outside of the sport An athletecentered philosophy emphasizes learning and improvement over winning which puts the athlete development first This philosophy should be dynamic as both societal and coaching experiences occur and change Mental Coaching is the most used technic to raise performance achievements by enhancing mental toughness It is predominantly used with elite athletes and high achievers The Global Performance Index is a tool developed to support this approach This holistic philosophy Mind Body Heart Spirit assesses quickly the mental Health of athletes while measuring their performance progresses Communication style is an important concept for sport psychologists to develop with coaches Communication is a constant role for coaches directed towards athletes parents administrators other coaches media and supporters It mainly comes in the forms of speaking writing body language and listening Verbal communication occurs through spoken word however nonverbal communication contributes hugely to how people perceive a coaches communication Nonverbal communication comes through actions facial expressions body position and gestures Coaches must be aware of the words tone and behaviors that they use Research has found that athletes respond best to positive feedback specific technical instruction and general encouragement Sport psychologists focus on developing coaching communication styles that are direct complete immediate and clear while also being supportive specific to the athlete and verbally and nonverbally congruent Coaches have become more open to the idea of having a good professional athletecoach relationship This relationship is the basis for an effective performance setting Team processes Sport psychologists may do consulting work or conduct research with entire teams This research focuses on team tendencies issues and beliefs at the group level not at the individual level Team cohesion can be defined as a groups tendency to stick together while pursuing its objectives Team cohesion has two components social cohesion how well teammates like one another and task cohesion how well teammates work together to achieve their goal Collective efficacy is a teams shared belief that they can or cannot accomplish a given task In other words this is the teams belief about the level of competency they have to perform a task Collective efficacy is an overall shared belief amongst team members and not merely the sum of individual selfefficacy beliefs Leadership can be thought of as a behavioral process that influences team members towards achieving a common goal Leadership in sports is pertinent because there are always leaders on a team ie team captains coaches trainers Research on leadership studies characteristics of effective leaders and leadership development Organizational sport psychology Since the early 2000s there has been a growing trend toward research and practice that better acknowledges the importance of creating sporting environments which enable people to thrive Organizational sport psychology is a subfield of sport psychology that is dedicated to better understanding individual behavior and social processes in sport organizations to promote organizational functioning The focus of organizational sport psychology is to develop knowledge that supports the development of optimally functioning sport organizations though the enhancement of daytoday experiences for those that operate within their sphere of influence This knowledge can be used in a variety of ways through interventions at the individual group or organizational level and thus organizational sport psychology reflects a systems perspective for academic study and an increasingly necessary aspect of practitioner competency Motivation in sport Motivation in field of psychology is loosely defined as the intensity and direction in which effort is applied The direction of motivation refers to how one seeks out situations or if they avoid things that might be challenging Intensity refers to how much effort one puts into any challenge or situation Motivation is tied closely to personality and can be categorized as a personality trait There are three general theories of motivation participanttrait theory situational theory and interactional theory These theories are similar to those of personality Participanttrait theory says motivation consists of the personality traits desires and goals of an athlete For example some athletes might be extremely competitive and have the desire to improve and win constantly These athletes would be motivated by competition with themselves and others Other theories state motivation depends on the situation and environment For example some athletes might not feel the desire to work hard when they are on their own but are motivated by others watching them Their motivation would be dependent on whether or not there are other people around Selfdetermination theory is based on a number of motives including but not limited to amotivation external regulation introjected regulation identified regulation integrated regulation and intrinsic motivation Amotivation is a lack of intention to engage in a behavior often accompanied by feelings of incompetence and a lack of connection between a behavior and the expected outcome External and introjected regulations showcase a nonselfdetermined type of extrinsic motivation due to the athlete lacking the feeling that their behavior is choiceful and therefore feeling as though their behavior is a result of psychological pressure Identified and integrated regulations represent selfdetermined types of extrinsic motivation because behavior is initiated out of choice but not necessarily perceived as enjoyable Intrinsic motivation comes from within is fully selfdetermined and characterized by interest in and enjoyment derived from the sport The Interactional theory combines the ideas of participanttrait and situational where the level of motivation of an individual depends on hisher traits and the situation at hand For example if an athlete is intrinsically competitive they may feel most motivated when participating in a match against many other people Depending on traits and situations it can be easier for some individuals to find motivation than others That being said those who are able to find motivation more easily are not guaranteed success and athletes who struggle can adjust some things to improve their drive Motivation can be facilitated by coaching or leaders changing the environment finding multiple reasons or motives to do something and being realistic about what is achievable High achieving athletes are more likely to be motivated to achieve success rather than being motivated to avoid failure Reversal theory of motivation states that all human behavior is experienced in eight states four sets of two A motivational state from each of the four pairs is present at any time Reversal theory has supporting research connecting psychological and physiological phenomena to these states Purposeful reversals from a less desired or useful state can increase performance and endurance Arousal and stress may be utilized in a unique and helpful way with the use of this theoretical framework The theory has been well supported in studies on several continents and in a variety of sports Image Visualization has recently gained attention as a popular approach to improving sport performance the concept was first introduced in the 1970s by Galway Galway says the most powerful opponent a player faces is their own mind Visualization is intense imagination in the mind without any action Athletes often create images in their mind about their competition They imagining themselves playing good or poorly technical skills analyze their mistakes worry about the competition etc Recovery from injury Sport psychologists may also deal with helping athletes recover from the psychological consequences resulting from injury Because athletes especially professionals are more at risk to injury than other kinds of exercisers the process of recovering from injury and the varying effects of different kinds of injuries are an important component of sport psychology research Additionally sport psychologist are interested in the differences between athletes that may elicit a stronger psychological reaction to an injury and who is most at risk for injury For example research has found men may be less likely to report concussions than women and could be at higher risk of injury due to their physiology Regarding psychological outcomes researchers are interested if the type of sport a person plays how closely they identify with being an athlete or the amount of time they have spent playing a sport can influence their mental health and research also explores what types of mental health outcomes are associated with injury fear depression stress etc As of 2013 sport psychologists have also began to explore the effectiveness of various techniques such as setting goals during rehabilitation selftalk or biofeedback techniques Injury among athletes has also been proven to negatively impact their mental health Especially with elite athletes whose job is to play a certain sport there is a proven negative mental impact to having an injury and not being able to play the sport There has been limited research in the past on how athletes deal with the burden of getting injured and not being able to play their sport however the recent research which has been done has shown that injury has caused athletes to have worsening mental health such as depression and anxiety Burnout Research on athlete burnout has historically been focused on the physical load from training and competitions in addition to the psychological stress associated with situational pressure to justify the occurrence of the burnout Traditionally burnout in athletes is explained by a strenuous work load that is needed to become competitive in sports with the flip side of this strenuous work being the danger of failing to adapt to training loads being injured or ill and therefore experiencing performance issues Research also claims that occurrence of burnout among athletes are rising and an athletes mental health is challenged when experiencing performance issues injuries or are ill These result in potential situational stressors that result in stress related responses such as negative thoughts and emotions Athlete burnout is explained as a result from an athletes experienced or believed inability to meet demands in training and competitions in which the distress is related to the discrepancy between the athletes expectations to achieve goals and cope with demands The concept of athlete burnout is made up of three parts physical and emotional exhaustion reduced performance accomplishment and sport devaluation The core element physical and emotional exhaustion is characterized by fatigue from training and competitions Reduced performance accomplishment is defined as focusing on the feeling of being unable to reach goals and succeed with training and competitions Sport devaluation the third aspect is characterized by loss of interest and care for sports which further results in reduced quality of performance Burnout can also be caused by continuous training and sport attention stress without physical or mental rest and recovery It results in staleness overtraining and eventually burnout Staleness is defined as a clear drop in athlete motivation and a plateau in performance Overtrained athletes often show psychophysiological malfunctions and performance declines Another factor that adds to burnout could be the feeling of being trapped by circumstances within a sport which perpetuates the cycles of this burnout Coaches and athletes are also very dependent on not only results but each other If athletes believe that they are not being pushed or the opposite being pushed too hard burnout is very possible and the drive to continue playing lowers Also because athletes are always striving to get to that next level in a sport once an athlete reaches that level it is shown that these athletes are more prone to becoming complacent and not feel the need to work as hard or burning out This can also happen to coaches at any level The repetitions which coaches face and similarly to athletes once they get to the highest level and win at the highest level they are more prone to burning out because there is nothing in the sport which they have not achieved Identity beyond sports Identity is built off of ones selfperception of their physical psychological and interpersonal characteristics which are rooted in personal experiences memories and social influences Athletic identity is defined as the degree to which an individual identifies with the athlete role and looks to others for acknowledgement of that role Athletic identity is developed through acquisition of skills confidence and social interaction during sport Cognitively it provides a framework for processing information how an individual copes with careerthreatening situations and inspires behavior consistent with an athlete The social role can be determined by the perceptions close to the athlete like family friends and teammates As a form of selfconcept athletic identity provides a way to evaluate competence or worth which can influence selfesteem and motivation After spending a majority of their lives training earning recognition for athletic accomplishments and integrating in the sports environment the athletic identity becomes a key component of an individuals identity as a whole Sport psychologists help empower athletes to explore and access other nonsports related identities in times of transition after the life as an athlete Some benefits of an athletic identity include a strong sense of self increased selfconfidence discipline and social interactions There are also health and fitness benefits Some consequences of a strong athletic identity include having emotional difficulties dealing with injuries because it usually results in inability to play or perform at peak performance which could result in loss of confidence and increase feelings of helplessness There can also be difficulty adjusting to life after the end of an athletic career Since sports is often a source of self worth it can become difficult to adjust to a life without sports for many athletes especially those who peak at a young age This can also lead to alternate career or educational options being considered because individuals with a strong athletic identity do not associate their identities with other activities Having an overly strong athletic identity can also result in burnout due to overcommitment towards an individuals role as an athlete Having a strong athletic identity can have a very positive impact on athletes during their athletic career as this allows them to focus solely on their career and bettering themselves When athletes who have a very strong athletic identity get injured and are sidelined away from the game it can lead to anxiety stress and depression because these athletes do not know who they are outside of the game they have been playing This is the same with athletes who have retired and not known what to do because there whole lives have been about sports Inversely athletes can be optimistic about their future postsports because they will have time to do activities which they never have been able to do before Selfesteem Selfesteem is the confidence someone has in themselves and their abilities Selfesteem is very important when it comes to sports This is why sport and physical activity as a whole has been proven to provide positive mental health benefits such as more confidence and higher selfesteem When athletes succeed in sport they are more confident in their abilities and their selfworth as a result Sport can also work inversely with selfesteem and cause athletes to feel worse about themselves If someone is playing poorly then it is possible the athlete will end up thinking less of themselves and having lower selfworth Playing sports in general and doing some form of physical activity already immediately makes people think of themselves as more than which is shown by research Stress Stress is the process by which people perceive and respond to certain events called stressors that they find difficult or threatening Stress is perceived as an interaction between a person and their environmentStress can be observed in athletes under the influence of external and internal factors of the sport environment Some identified stressors included excessive amounts of pressure spectators training competition environment injuries physical errors abilities selfdoubt watching the opponent etc These are just a few of the many stressors an athlete can face in their environment Research in this context is increasing every day and multiple studies have shown the importance of sport psychology has plays in improving the performance of coaches and athletes Role of psychology in studentathletes Pursuing a dual career in sport and school aka studentathletes are more at risk for overall wellbeing With decreased mental health and increased stress levels due to needing to cope with multiple demands When studentathletes experience higher weekly sporttoschool conflict than usual they have higher sportrelated stress than usual Studentathletes that experienced higher levels of stress also reported greater sport anxiety while in game of their respective sports These students must handle the stressors associated with being a student while juggling their sport practices and game experiences A study conducted by Kegelaers et al in 2022 examined the mental health of studentathletes The study included a comprehensive review of 159 studies spanning three decades mostly conducted in North America The majority of studentathletes in these studies 625 reported illhealth outcomes eg disordered eating anxiety depression with 226 of studentathletes reporting positive health outcomes eg subjective wellbeing psychological wellbeing Most variables contributing to mental health issues were related to generic or sportspecific factors with a limited number of studies examining dualcareer specific factors such as enrolling in collegiate sports and academics at the same time Professional sports In professional sports the role of a sport psychologist is subject to change Roles can changed based on the employment of staff within the organization from management to coaching staff Examples of services performed include performance enhancement services clinical or counseling services psychological testing and mindfulness training Through performance enhancement services psychologists help professional athletes with selfregulation to enhancing team cohesion Sport psychologists in professional sports organizations also must be well trained in clinical or counseling psychology to help professional athletes deal with personal issues that occur off the field Sport psychologists must also be trained in psychological testing which is generally used in predrafting situations as professional sports teams want to identify psychological factors that could negatively influence a draft candidates potential Mindfulness techniques are also a useful too for sport psychologists to utilize as mindfulness training has been linked with better performance in professional competition Commonly used techniques Below are some of the more common techniques or skills sport psychologists teach to athletes for improving their performance and along with their mental health Arousal regulation Arousal regulation refers to entering into and maintaining an optimal level of cognitive and physiological activation in order to maximize performance This may include relaxation if one becomes too anxious or stressed through methods such as progressive muscle relaxation deep breathing exercises and meditation or the use of energizing techniques eg listening to music energizing cues if one is not alert enough This may also include cognitive strategies of relaxation through methods of psychological preparation and positive selftalk Progressive muscle relaxation PMR refers to the progressive tensing and relaxing of target muscle groups which can help lower blood pressure reduce state anxiety improve performance and decrease stress hormones This technique was developed by Edmund Jacobson who found that people under stress typically displayed increased muscle tension This technique requires athletes to feel the tension in a muscle group in order to recognize the subsequent relaxation To successfully use this technique athletes must allot about twenty to thirty minutes to the activity tense each muscle group for about four to eight seconds and ensure that controlled and deep breathing is also applied It is important to note that this technique can increase feelings of fatigue Although this technique is not wellsuited as a preperformance method of arousal regulation it has been found that longterm regular practice can reduce state anxiety and sportsrelated pain which is often exacerbated by anxiety Deep breathing exercises involve the awareness of ones rhythm of breath and the conscious effort to take slow deep breaths Slow deep breathing is a traditional practice in Eastern culture yoga and meditation It is used to activate the parasympathetic nervous system which helps reduce blood pressure and heart rate The medically accepted respiratory rate in humans is between 10 and 20 breaths per minute while slow breathing is between the range of 410 breaths per minute There are various methods to apply slow breathing such as the 478 technique The simplest form is deeply breathing for 15 minutes at a slow pace To enhance the effects individuals may utilize diaphragmatic breathing simultaneously To do so an individual inhales through the nose allowing his or her belly to rise as the lungs fill Then after a momentary pause release the breath slowly through the mouth or nose Along with its physiological use there is evidence that deep breathing can increase a sense of relaxation and reduce anxiety A study on competitive swimmers found that regular practice of deep breathing exercises can improve lung functions by increasing respiratory endurance The use of meditation and specifically mindfulness is a growing practice in the field of arousal recognition The MindfulnessAcceptanceCommitment MAC Theory is the most common form of mindfulness in sport and was formed in 2001 The aim of MAC is to maximize human potential for a rich full and meaningful life It includes specific protocol that involve meditation and acceptance practices on a regular basis as well as before and during competition These protocol have been tested various times using NCAA mens and womens basketball players In a study done by Frank L Gardner an NCAA womens basketball player increased her personal satisfaction in her performances from 24 out of 10 to 92 out of 10 after performing the specific MAC protocol for several weeks Also the effect of mental barriers on her game decreased from 8 out of 8 to 22 out of 8 during that same time period as a result of the MAC protocol Another study of the MAC protocol performed by Frank Gardner and Zella Moore on an adolescent competitive diver showed that when the MAC protocol is tailored to a specific population it has the potential to provide performance enhancement In this case the vocabulary and examples in the protocol were tailored to be more practical for a 12yearold After performed the MAC protocol for several weeks the diver showed between a 13 to 14 percent increase in his diving scores This finding is important because previously the majority of tests performed using the MAC protocol had been on world class athletes Arousal anxiety and stress Although anxiety or stress are often believed to a negative thing they are actually a necessary response for the body to survive It is natural for the body to exhibit certain levels of anxiety and stress however it becomes a problem when it begins to inhibit activity Arousal is the physiological and psychological activation of the body in response to an event Trait anxiety exists in an individual when they experience unusually high response levels to a wide spread of situations that are not threatening State anxiety is the momentary feeling of nervousness or worry that accompanies the arousal of the body State anxiety can be defined cognitively where nervous thoughts and worries occur for a moment There is also somatic state anxiety where the body experiences a physiological response to arousal This sometimes manifests momentarily as a fluttering in the stomach or an elevated pulse There are four major theories of arousal and anxiety Drive theory is an approach that considers anxiety to be a positive asset In situations where anxiety is high performance increases proportionally This theory is not well accepted because it is thought that athletes can be psyched up but they can also be psyched out This simply means anxiety can work to motivated some but it can inhibit others It is entirely dependent on the individuals personality so it can not be broadly applied to all athletes Inverted U theory is an approach that proposes that the best performance occurs when stress is moderate not too high or low This idea is demonstrated in a graph where physiological arousal is plotted against performance The curve resembles and inverted U because the performance is at its highest value where the arousal is at half of its highest value The zone of optimal functioning theory looks at each type each athlete and what level of arousal they need to perform best This suggests that each athlete requires their own level of stress and arousal to feel motivated and perform well This theory is specific but difficult to quantify One proposed model for optimal functioning was proposed by Yuri Hanin This model focuses on the interaction between natural emotional experience and the repetition of athletics The combination of these concepts creates an emotional pattern that is stable to each individual It takes into account positive negative optimal and dysfunctional emotional experiences and how they effect athletic performance Peak performance is when an athlete experiences this zone of optimal functioning This stage is described as including dissociation and intense concentration to the point of being unaware of ones surroundings lack of fatigue and pain perceptual timeslowing and feeling power and control This state cannot be forced to happen although athletes can develop control over several psychological variables that contribute to achieving peak performance Sport psychologists try to give athletes the tools to have more control over reaching this peak performance level These interventions targets controlling state anxiety and arousal level for the individual and task needs to maximize performance abilities Some of the strategies used include cognitive reappraisal breathing and relaxation and hypnosis Practicespecificitybased model of arousal The PracticeSpecificityBased Model of Arousal Movahedi 2007 holds that for best and peak performances to occur athletes need only to create an arousal level similar to the one they have experienced throughout training sessions For peak performance athletes do not need to have high or low arousal levels It is important that they create the same level of arousal throughout training sessions and competition In other words high levels of arousal can be beneficial if athletes experience such heightened levels of arousal during some consecutive training sessions Similarly low levels of arousal can be beneficial if athletes experience such low levels of arousal during some consecutive training sessions Goal setting Goal setting is the process of systematically planning ways to achieve specific accomplishments within a certain amount of time Research suggests that goals should be specific measurable difficult but attainable timebased written down and a combination of shortterm and longterm goals A metaanalysis of goal setting in sport suggests that when compared to setting no goals or do your best goals setting the above types of goals is an effective method for improving performance According to Dr Eva V Monsma shortterm goals should be used to help achieve longterm goals Dr Monsma also states that it is important to set goals in positive terms by focusing on behaviors that should be present rather than those that should be absent Each longterm goal should also have a series of shortterm goals that progress in difficulty For instance shortterm goals should progress from those that are easy to achieve to those that are more challenging Having challenging shortterm goals will remove the repetitiveness of easy goals and will give one an edge when striving for their longterm goals There are three major types of goals within sport psychology outcome goals performance goals and process goals Types of goals Outcome goals describe how an individual or team aim to compare to the other competitors This type of goal is unique because of its nature being ingrained in social comparison Winning is the most common outcome goal This type of goal is the least effective because it depends on so many factors that are extrinsic to the individual Performance goals are subjective goals that are concerned with personal achievement in a result These products of performance are based on standard that is subjective for the individual and usually based on numeric measurements Examples include finishing a race in a certain time jumping a certain height or completing a specific number of repetitions Process goals are focused on the process of performance These include execution of behaviors used in the activity of getting to the final product of performance Examples include breathing control maintaining body posture or use of imagery Imagery Imagery or motor imagery can be defined as using multiple senses to create or recreate experiences in ones mind Additionally the more vivid images are the more likely they are to be interpreted by the brain as identical to the actual event which increases the effectiveness of mental practice with imagery Good imagery therefore attempts to create as lifelike an image as possible through the use of multiple senses eg sight smell kinesthetic proper timing perspective and accurate portrayal of the task Both anecdotal evidence from athletes and research findings suggest imagery is an effective tool to enhance performance and psychological states relevant to performance eg confidence This is a concept commonly used by coaches and athletes the day before an event There are two perspectives one can take when using imagery first person where one pictures doing the skill hisher self and third person imagery where one pictures watching the skill be done by hisher self or another athlete Athletes can use whichever perspective is most comfortable for them There are multiple theories of how athletes use imagery Psychoneuromuscular theory proposes that athletes activate the muscles associated with an action by picturing themselves doing the action Activating the neurons that provide input to the muscles is similar to actually practicing the motion Symbolic learning theory proposes that athletes recognize patterns in activities and performance The patterns are then used to create a mental map or model of how to do completes a series of actions Vividness theory suggests that athletes use the five senses to take in information while completing an action and then using the memories of these stimuli to make their mental recreation of the event as realistic as possible Controllability theory focuses on the ability of athletes to manipulate images in their mind This way they are able to picture themselves correcting a mistake or doing something properly This is thought to make goals seem more attainable to athletes This type of imagery can also be harmful where athletes visualize themselves making a mistake repeatedly All strategies of imagery are functional but each athlete might find one more effective than others Each strategy can be utilized based on the individual needs and goals of the athlete In order to be effective the practice of imagery needs to be inculcated into regular routines as a supplement to physical training Athletes must learn how to use imagery in a quiet nondistracting place while picturing realistic and attainable images Using trigger words can facilitate imagery and bring the athlete closer to the pictured goal Pre performance routines Pre performance routines refer to the actions and behaviors athletes use to prepare for a game or performance This includes pregame routines warm up routines and actions an athlete will regularly do mentally and physically before they execute the performance Frequently these will incorporate other commonly used techniques such as imagery or selftalk Examples would be visualizations done by skiers dribbling by basketball players at the foul line and preshot routines golfers or baseball players use prior to a shot or pitch These routines help to develop consistency and predictability for the player This allows the muscles and mind to develop better motor control Pre performance routines allow an athletes mind to relax and go back to something which they know to calm them down This has resulted in lowering athletes anxiety and increase their selfbelief which as a result will increase athletic performance because of the lowered anxiety and stress prior to the actual event For example when a batter in baseball is up to bat a lot of the athletes will regrip their batting gloves and take a couple of practice swings not because they need the practice but because that routine is familiar and will allow them to clear their mind and relax their anxiety Selftalk Selftalk refers to the thoughts and words athletes and performers say to themselves usually in their minds Selftalk phrases or cues are used to direct attention towards a particular thing in order to improve focus or are used alongside other techniques to facilitate their effectiveness These uses are typically fit into two categories of selftalk instructional and motivational Instructional selftalk refers to cues that an athlete might use to focus and remind oneself of proper technique For example a softball player may think release point when at bat to direct her attention while a golfer may say smooth stroke before putting to stay relaxed Motivational selftalk signifies cues that might build confidence maximize effort or reaffirm ones abilities For example one might tell themselves to give it all or that I can do it Research suggests either positive or negative selftalk may improve performance suggesting the effectiveness of selftalk phrases depends on how the phrase is interpreted by the individual However the use of positive selftalk is considered to be more efficacious and is consistent with the associative network theory of Gordon Bower and the selfefficacy tenet within the broader social cognitive theory of Albert Bandura The use of words in sport has been widely utilized The ability to bombard the unconscious mind with one single positive phrase is one of the most effective and easy to use psychological skills available to any athlete Biofeedback Biofeedback uses external technology to measure and make an individual aware of internal physiological processes There is some evidence that physiological measures such as heart rate or brain waves appear to be different in elite athletes than that of the typical person This is a field that should be further looked into however it could have beneficial implications for athletes to be able to monitor and control these physiological measures to maximize performance Biofeedback has become increasingly prevalent as the field progresses It has proven success in peak performance training such as the psychophysiological preparation of athletes for highstakes sports competitions eg the Olympic games In a 2015 study athletes were subjected to stress tests and given training in biofeedback techniques One year following the completion of the study participants were contacted and asked if the techniques learned during the study were still used All participants indicated that they were still using the biofeedbackpsychoregulation skills and that they believed these skills enhanced both their athletic performance and general wellbeing Modeling Modeling is a form of observational learning where an athlete observes another individual around the same level of skill learning perform sport related movements and receive feedback This has been shown help modify athletes thoughts emotions and behaviors in beneficial ways In order for this form of learning to work the athlete must be motivated attentive able to recall and willing to try to mimic their observation of the model Music Music can be used a valuable strategy to help athletes manage arousal levels to increase performance outcomes Music can be sedative or stimulating First music can be sedative by mitigating somatic state anxiety For instance unfamiliar relaxing music unfamiliar arousing music and familiar arousing music were all shown to have an effect on physiological parameters galvanic skin response peripheral temperature and heart rate However in a particular study unfamiliar relaxing music decreased arousal levels more than the other two types of selected music Music can be used as a stimulant as well Athletes will listen to music to get them to an optimal arousal level Additionally athletes listen to music to prepare for or get into the mood of events Music influences arousal levels through the activation of the prefrontal cortex which has a direct influence on the emotional state of an individual Moreover it was found that listening to music increases the release of dopamine which illustrates a rewarding component of listening to music If athletes want to impact arousal levels they should be aware of the effect tempo has on arousal levels For instance athletes should listen to fast tempo music instead of slow tempo music to achieve higher arousal levels Lastly music is effective in managing arousal by shifting athletes attention inward preventing the athlete from giving into outside distractions that could lead to higher arousal and impact performance negatively Sportspecific differences Personality characteristics It is beneficial for sport psychologists to understand how athlete personalities systematically vary depending on type of sport played Research on athlete personalities allows professionals to put in the maximum investment and select specific sports due to a background understanding of the dynamic that they are intervening in Personality characteristics differ between team versus individual sports as well as different types of sports Big five personality traits Research on the big five personality traits openness conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism as well as some other characteristics have differentiated personalities of athletes in individual sports compared to team sports Athletes in individual sports scored higher on measures of conscientiousness and autonomy Teamsport athletes scored higher on measures of agreeableness and sociotropy These characteristics can be explained by the demands of each sport type Individual sports require athletes to be selfreliant while team sports require group cohesion in order to be successful Athletes participating in both team and individual sports score equally on measures of neuroticism extraversion and openness These traits help provide a personality profile for sport psychologist seeking to work with certain types of sports Sensation seeking Sensation seeking is a phenomenon where an individual seeks to participate in novel complex or intense activities with higher amounts of thrill in order to satisfy their personal need for arousal This is one area where personalities in different types of sports can be differentiated High sensation seekers tend to participate in the highthrill extreme sports such as sky diving car racing scuba diving whitewater sports and skiing Sensation seeking is not a motive for other highrisk sports such as mountaineering and Ocean rowing The highthrill sports involve intense speed and excitement as well as a perception of risk Individuals with a moderate level of sensation seeking tend to participate in common sports that are unpredictable but also minimally risky Some examples are basketball baseball volleyball and golf Low sensation seekers participate in sports that require large amounts of training and consistency such as longdistance running gymnastics or swimming This is one area of personality type that differs for different sports Psychopathology Different categories of sports display different mental health profiles Overall female athletes are more likely to develop a psychopathology specifically anxiety depression or eating disorders Up to 70 of female athletes struggle with two specific eating disorders anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa with up to 42 of the original 70 consisting of athletes at a higher competition level These are consistent with the general public as well Anxiety depression and sleep problems are most prevalent in highly aesthetic sports such as ballet or gymnastics These are least prevalent in high risk sports and team ball sports Eating disorders are more prevalent in athletes than the general public For women eating disorders are highly prevalent in aesthetic racing and fine motor sports and least prevalent in team ball sports Eating disorders are most prevalent for men in high combat and contact sports There are more problematic eating behaviors in sports that place and emphasis on thinness and weightdependence Exercise psychology Exercise psychology can be defined as the study of psychological issues and theories related to exercise Exercise psychology is a subdiscipline within the field of psychology and is typically grouped with sport psychology For example Division 47 of the APA is for exercise and sport psychology not just one or the other while organizations like AASP encompass both exercise and sport psychology However Division 47 also recognizes that it is important to distinguish between sport and exercise psychology as any definition that encompasses both disciplines would be too broad to account for the nuances in each The link between exercise and psychology has long been recognized In 1899 William James discussed the importance of exercise writing it was needed to furnish the background of sanity serenityand make us goodhumored and easy of approach Other researchers noted the connection between exercise and depression concluding a moderate amount of exercise was more helpful than no exercise in symptom improvement Additionally meeting exercise requirements can also aid in alleviating symptoms of avoidance disorders and anxiety while also providing a higher quality of life for the patient in terms of physical health As a subdiscipline the amount of research in exercise psychology increased in the 1950s and 1960s leading to several presentations at the second gathering of the International Society of Sport Psychology in 1968 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s William Morgan wrote several pieces on the relationship between exercise and various topics such as mood anxiety and adherence to exercise programs Morgan also went on to found APA Division 47 in 1986 As an interdisciplinary subject exercise psychology draws on several different scientific fields ranging from psychology to physiology to neuroscience Major topics of study are the relationship between exercise and mental health eg stress affect selfesteem interventions that promote physical activity exploring exercise patterns in different populations eg the elderly the obese theories of behavior change and problems associated with exercise eg injury eating disorders exercise addiction Recent evidence also suggests that besides mental health and wellbeing sport practice can improve general cognitive abilities When requiring sufficient cognitive demands physical activity seems to be an optimal way to improve cognition possibly more efficiently than cognitive training or physical exercise alone Mental health in sport psychology Mental health plays a big role in an athletes performance Sport organizations are advised to recognize athlete mental health as not only a core component of a healthy elite sport system but also as a key indicator of the athletes effectiveness Some common stressors that affect an athletes mental health are injuries underperforming and environmental factors With these stressors plus others the athletes are now prone to deeper mental health issues including anxiety and depression However some athletes use the sport as a way of escape somewhere to hide from the mental issues they are currently facing whether that be depression and anxiety or a more complex diagnosis It is difficult to find evidence pertaining to mental health in athletes because many studies on mental health do not generally focus on mental health in athletes specifically See also Athletic training Clinical psychology Counseling

    originalContent:
      "A mental disorder also referred to as a mental illness a mental health condition or a psychiatric disability is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning A mental disorder is also characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individuals cognition emotional regulation or behavior often in a social context Such disturbances may occur as single episodes may be persistent or may be relapsingremitting There are many different types of mental disorders with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health The causes of mental disorders are often unclear Theories incorporate findings from a range of fields Disorders may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain Disorders are usually diagnosed or assessed by a mental health professional such as a clinical psychologist psychiatrist psychiatric nurse or clinical social worker using various methods such as psychometric tests but often relying on observation and questioning Cultural and religious beliefs as well as social norms should be taken into account when making a diagnosis Services for mental disorders are usually based in psychiatric hospitals outpatient clinics or in the community Treatments are provided by mental health professionals Common treatment options are psychotherapy or psychiatric medication while lifestyle changes social interventions peer support and selfhelp are also options In a minority of cases there may be involuntary detention or treatment Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression In 2019 common mental disorders around the globe include depression which affects about 264 million people dementia which affects about 50 million bipolar disorder which affects about 45 million and schizophrenia and other psychoses which affect about 20 million people Neurodevelopmental disorders include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD autism spectrum disorder ASD and intellectual disability of which onset occurs early in the developmental period Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion Definition The definition and classification of mental disorders are key issues for researchers as well as service providers and those who may be diagnosed For a mental state to be classified as a disorder it generally needs to cause dysfunction Most international clinical documents use the term mental disorder while illness is also common It has been noted that using the term mental ie of the mind is not necessarily meant to imply separateness from the brain or body According to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSMIV published in 1994 a mental disorder is a psychological syndrome or pattern that is associated with distress eg via a painful symptom disability impairment in one or more important areas of functioning increased risk of death or causes a significant loss of autonomy however it excludes normal responses such as the grief from loss of a loved one and also excludes deviant behavior for political religious or societal reasons not arising from a dysfunction in the individual DSMIV predicates the definition with caveats stating that as in the case with many medical terms mental disorder lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations noting that different levels of abstraction can be used for medical definitions including pathology symptomology deviance from a normal range or etiology and that the same is true for mental disorders so that sometimes one type of definition is appropriate and sometimes another depending on the situation In 2013 the American Psychiatric Association APA redefined mental disorders in the DSM5 as a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individuals cognition emotion regulation or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning The final draft of ICD11 contains a very similar definition The terms mental breakdown or nervous breakdown may be used by the general population to mean a mental disorder The terms nervous breakdown and mental breakdown have not been formally defined through a medical diagnostic system such as the DSM5 or ICD10 and are nearly absent from scientific literature regarding mental illness Although nervous breakdown is not rigorously defined surveys of laypersons suggest that the term refers to a specific acute timelimited reactive disorder involving symptoms such as anxiety or depression usually precipitated by external stressors Many health experts today refer to a nervous breakdown as a mental health crisis Nervous illness In addition to the concept of mental disorder some people have argued for a return to the oldfashioned concept of nervous illness In How Everyone Became Depressed The Rise and Fall of the Nervous Breakdown 2013 Edward Shorter a professor of psychiatry and the history of medicine says About half of them are depressed Or at least that is the diagnosis that they got when they were put on antidepressants They go to work but they are unhappy and uncomfortable they are somewhat anxious they are tired they have various physical painsand they tend to obsess about the whole business There is a term for what they have and it is a good oldfashioned term that has gone out of use They have nerves or a nervous illness It is an illness not just of mind or brain but a disorder of the entire body We have a package here of five symptomsmild depression some anxiety fatigue somatic pains and obsessive thinking We have had nervous illness for centuries When you are too nervous to function it is a nervous breakdown But that term has vanished from medicine although not from the way we speak The nervous patients of yesteryear are the depressives of today That is the bad news There is a deeper illness that drives depression and the symptoms of mood We can call this deeper illness something else or invent a neologism but we need to get the discussion off depression and onto this deeper disorder in the brain and body That is the point In eliminating the nervous breakdown psychiatry has come close to having its own nervous breakdown Nerves stand at the core of common mental illness no matter how much we try to forget them Nervous breakdown is a pseudomedical term to describe a wealth of stressrelated feelings and they are often made worse by the belief that there is a real phenomenon called nervous breakdown Classifications There are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders ICD11 Chapter 06 Mental behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders part of the International Classification of Diseases produced by the WHO in effect since 1 January 2022 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM5 produced by the APA since 1952 Both of these list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis They have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable although significant differences remain Other classification schemes may be used in nonwestern cultures for example the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders and other manuals may be used by those of alternative theoretical persuasions such as the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual In general mental disorders are classified separately from neurological disorders learning disabilities or intellectual disability Unlike the DSM and ICD some approaches are not based on identifying distinct categories of disorder using dichotomous symptom profiles intended to separate the abnormal from the normal There is significant scientific debate about the relative merits of categorical versus such noncategorical or hybrid schemes also known as continuum or dimensional models A spectrum approach may incorporate elements of both In the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements including of what is normal while another proposes that it is or could be entirely objective and scientific including by reference to statistical norms Common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective even if only a fuzzy prototype that can never be precisely defined or conversely that the concept always involves a mixture of scientific facts and subjective value judgments Although the diagnostic categories are referred to as disorders they are presented as medical diseases but are not validated in the same way as most medical diagnoses Some neurologists argue that classification will only be reliable and valid when based on neurobiological features rather than clinical interview while others suggest that the differing ideological and practical perspectives need to be better integrated The DSM and ICD approach remains under attack both because of the implied causality model and because some researchers believe it better to aim at underlying brain differences which can precede symptoms by many years Dimensional models The high degree of comorbidity between disorders in categorical models such as the DSM and ICD have led some to propose dimensional models Studying comorbidity between disorders have demonstrated two latent unobserved factors or dimensions in the structure of mental disorders that are thought to possibly reflect etiological processes These two dimensions reflect a distinction between internalizing disorders such as mood or anxiety symptoms and externalizing disorders such as behavioral or substance use symptoms A single general factor of psychopathology similar to the g factor for intelligence has been empirically supported The p factor model supports the internalizingexternalizing distinction but also supports the formation of a third dimension of thought disorders such as schizophrenia Biological evidence also supports the validity of the internalizingexternalizing structure of mental disorders with twin and adoption studies supporting heritable factors for externalizing and internalizing disorders A leading dimensional model is the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology Disorders There are many different categories of mental disorder and many different facets of human behavior and personality that can become disordered Anxiety disorder An anxiety disorder is anxiety or fear that interferes with normal functioning may be classified as an anxiety disorder Commonly recognized categories include specific phobias generalized anxiety disorder social anxiety disorder panic disorder agoraphobia obsessivecompulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Mood disorder Other affective emotionmood processes can also become disordered Mood disorder involving unusually intense and sustained sadness melancholia or despair is known as major depression also known as unipolar or clinical depression Milder but still prolonged depression can be diagnosed as dysthymia Bipolar disorder also known as manic depression involves abnormally high or pressured mood states known as mania or hypomania alternating with normal or depressed moods The extent to which unipolar and bipolar mood phenomena represent distinct categories of disorder or mix and merge along a dimension or spectrum of mood is subject to some scientific debate Psychotic disorder Patterns of belief language use and perception of reality can become dysregulated eg delusions thought disorder hallucinations Psychotic disorders in this domain include schizophrenia and delusional disorder Schizoaffective disorder is a category used for individuals showing aspects of both schizophrenia and affective disorders Schizotypy is a category used for individuals showing some of the characteristics associated with schizophrenia but without meeting cutoff criteria Personality disorder Personalitythe fundamental characteristics of a person that influence thoughts and behaviors across situations and timemay be considered disordered if judged to be abnormally rigid and maladaptive Although treated separately by some the commonly used categorical schemes include them as mental disorders albeit on a separate axis II in the case of the DSMIV A number of different personality disorders are listed including those sometimes classed as eccentric such as paranoid schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders types that have described as dramatic or emotional such as antisocial borderline histrionic or narcissistic personality disorders and those sometimes classed as fearrelated such as anxiousavoidant dependent or obsessivecompulsive personality disorders Personality disorders in general are defined as emerging in childhood or at least by adolescence or early adulthood The ICD also has a category for enduring personality change after a catastrophic experience or psychiatric illness If an inability to sufficiently adjust to life circumstances begins within three months of a particular event or situation and ends within six months after the stressor stops or is eliminated it may instead be classed as an adjustment disorder There is an emerging consensus that personality disorders similar to personality traits in general incorporate a mixture of acute dysfunctional behaviors that may resolve in short periods and maladaptive temperamental traits that are more enduring Furthermore there are also noncategorical schemes that rate all individuals via a profile of different dimensions of personality without a symptombased cutoff from normal personality variation for example through schemes based on dimensional models Eating disorder An eating disorder is a serious mental health condition that involves an unhealthy relationship with food and body image They can cause severe physical and psychological problems Eating disorders involve disproportionate concern in matters of food and weight Categories of disorder in this area include anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa exercise bulimia or binge eating disorder Sleep disorder Sleep disorders are associated with disruption to normal sleep patterns A common sleep disorder is insomnia which is described as difficulty falling andor staying asleep Other sleep disorders include narcolepsy sleep apnea REM sleep behavior disorder chronic sleep deprivation and restless leg syndrome Narcolepsy is a condition of extreme tendencies to fall asleep whenever and wherever People with narcolepsy feel refreshed after their random sleep but eventually get sleepy again Narcolepsy diagnosis requires an overnight stay at a sleep center for analysis during which doctors ask for a detailed sleep history and sleep records Doctors also use actigraphs and polysomnography Doctors will do a multiple sleep latency test which measures how long it takes a person to fall asleep Sleep apnea when breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep can be a serious sleep disorder Three types of sleep apnea include obstructive sleep apnea central sleep apnea and complex sleep apnea Sleep apnea can be diagnosed at home or with polysomnography at a sleep center An ear nose and throat doctor may further help with the sleeping habits Sexuality related Sexual disorders include dyspareunia and various kinds of paraphilia sexual arousal to objects situations or individuals that are considered abnormal or harmful to the person or others Other Impulse control disorder People who are abnormally unable to resist certain urges or impulses that could be harmful to themselves or others may be classified as having an impulse control disorder and disorders such as kleptomania stealing or pyromania firesetting Various behavioral addictions such as gambling addiction may be classed as a disorder Obsessivecompulsive disorder can sometimes involve an inability to resist certain acts but is classed separately as being primarily an anxiety disorder Substance use disorder This disorder refers to the use of drugs legal or illegal including alcohol that persists despite significant problems or harm related to its use Substance dependence and substance abuse fall under this umbrella category in the DSM Substance use disorder may be due to a pattern of compulsive and repetitive use of a drug that results in tolerance to its effects and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped Dissociative disorder People with severe disturbances of their selfidentity memory and general awareness of themselves and their surroundings may be classified as having these types of disorders including depersonalization derealization disorder or dissociative identity disorder which was previously referred to as multiple personality disorder or split personality Cognitive disorder These affect cognitive abilities including learning and memory This category includes delirium and mild and major neurocognitive disorder previously termed dementia Developmental disorder These disorders initially occur in childhood Some examples include autism spectrum disorder oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD which may continue into adulthood Conduct disorder if continuing into adulthood may be diagnosed as antisocial personality disorder dissocial personality disorder in the ICD Popular labels such as psychopath or sociopath do not appear in the DSM or ICD but are linked by some to these diagnoses Somatoform disorders may be diagnosed when there are problems that appear to originate in the body that are thought to be manifestations of a mental disorder This includes somatization disorder and conversion disorder There are also disorders of how a person perceives their body such as body dysmorphic disorder Neurasthenia is an old diagnosis involving somatic complaints as well as fatigue and low spiritsdepression which is officially recognized by the ICD10 but no longer by the DSMIV Factitious disorders are diagnosed where symptoms are thought to be reported for personal gain Symptoms are often deliberately produced or feigned and may relate to either symptoms in the individual or in someone close to them particularly people they care for There are attempts to introduce a category of relational disorder where the diagnosis is of a relationship rather than on any one individual in that relationship The relationship may be between children and their parents between couples or others There already exists under the category of psychosis a diagnosis of shared psychotic disorder where two or more individuals share a particular delusion because of their close relationship with each other There are a number of uncommon psychiatric syndromes which are often named after the person who first described them such as Capgras syndrome De Clerambault syndrome Othello syndrome Ganser syndrome Cotard delusion and Ekbom syndrome and additional disorders such as the Couvade syndrome and Geschwind syndrome Signs and symptoms Course The onset of psychiatric disorders usually occurs from childhood to early adulthood Impulsecontrol disorders and a few anxiety disorders tend to appear in childhood Some other anxiety disorders substance disorders and mood disorders emerge later in the midteens Symptoms of schizophrenia typically manifest from late adolescence to early twenties The likely course and outcome of mental disorders vary and are dependent on numerous factors related to the disorder itself the individual as a whole and the social environment Some disorders may last a brief period of time while others may be longterm in nature All disorders can have a varied course Longterm international studies of schizophrenia have found that over a half of individuals recover in terms of symptoms and around a fifth to a third in terms of symptoms and functioning with many requiring no medication While some have serious difficulties and support needs for many years late recovery is still plausible The World Health Organization WHO concluded that the longterm studies findings converged with others in relieving patients carers and clinicians of the chronicity paradigm which dominated thinking throughout much of the 20th century A followup study by Tohen and coworkers revealed that around half of people initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve symptomatic recovery no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis within six weeks and nearly all achieve it within two years with nearly half regaining their prior occupational and residential status in that period Less than half go on to experience a new episode of mania or major depression within the next two years Disability Some disorders may be very limited in their functional effects while others may involve substantial disability and support needs In this context the terms psychiatric disability and psychological disability are sometimes used instead of mental disorder The degree of ability or disability may vary over time and across different life domains Furthermore psychiatric disability has been linked to institutionalization discrimination and social exclusion as well as to the inherent effects of disorders Alternatively functioning may be affected by the stress of having to hide a condition in work or school etc by adverse effects of medications or other substances or by mismatches between illnessrelated variations and demands for regularity It is also the case that while often being characterized in purely negative terms some mental traits or states labeled as psychiatric disabilities can also involve aboveaverage creativity nonconformity goalstriving meticulousness or empathy In addition the public perception of the level of disability associated with mental disorders can change Nevertheless internationally people report equal or greater disability from commonly occurring mental conditions than from commonly occurring physical conditions particularly in their social roles and personal relationships The proportion with access to professional help for mental disorders is far lower however even among those assessed as having a severe psychiatric disability Disability in this context may or may not involve such things as Basic activities of daily living Including looking after the self health care grooming dressing shopping cooking etc or looking after accommodation chores DIY tasks etc Interpersonal relationships Including communication skills ability to form relationships and sustain them ability to leave the home or mix in crowds or particular settings Occupational functioning Ability to acquire an employment and hold it cognitive and social skills required for the job dealing with workplace culture or studying as a student In terms of total disabilityadjusted life years DALYs which is an estimate of how many years of life are lost due to premature death or to being in a state of poor health and disability psychiatric disabilities rank amongst the most disabling conditions Unipolar also known as Major depressive disorder is the third leading cause of disability worldwide of any condition mental or physical accounting for 655 million years lost The first systematic description of global disability arising in youth in 2011 found that among 10 to 24yearolds nearly half of all disability current and as estimated to continue was due to psychiatric disabilities including substance use disorders and conditions involving selfharm Second to this were accidental injuries mainly traffic collisions accounting for 12 percent of disability followed by communicable diseases at 10 percent The psychiatric disabilities associated with most disabilities in highincome countries were unipolar major depression 20 and alcohol use disorder 11 In the eastern Mediterranean region it was unipolar major depression 12 and schizophrenia 7 and in Africa it was unipolar major depression 7 and bipolar disorder 5 Suicide which is often attributed to some underlying mental disorder is a leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under 35 There are an estimated 10 to 20 million nonfatal attempted suicides every year worldwide Risk factors The predominant view as of 2018 is that genetic psychological and environmental factors all contribute to the development or progression of mental disorders Different risk factors may be present at different ages with risk occurring as early as during prenatal period Genetics A number of psychiatric disorders are linked to a family history including depression narcissistic personality disorder and anxiety Twin studies have also revealed a very high heritability for many mental disorders especially autism and schizophrenia Although researchers have been looking for decades for clear linkages between genetics and mental disorders that work has not yielded specific genetic biomarkers yet that might lead to better diagnosis and better treatments Statistical research looking at eleven disorders found widespread assortative mating between people with mental illness That means that individuals with one of these disorders were two to three times more likely than the general population to have a partner with a mental disorder Sometimes people seemed to have preferred partners with the same mental illness Thus people with schizophrenia or ADHD are seven times more likely to have affected partners with the same disorder This is even more pronounced for people with Autism spectrum disorders who are 10 times more likely to have a spouse with the same disorder Environment During the prenatal stage factors like unwanted pregnancy lack of adaptation to pregnancy or substance use during pregnancy increases the risk of developing a mental disorder Maternal stress and birth complications including prematurity and infections have also been implicated in increasing susceptibility for mental illness Infants neglected or not provided optimal nutrition have a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment Social influences have also been found to be important including abuse neglect bullying social stress traumatic events and other negative or overwhelming life experiences Aspects of the wider community have also been implicated including employment problems socioeconomic inequality lack of social cohesion problems linked to migration and features of particular societies and cultures The specific risks and pathways to particular disorders are less clear however Nutrition also plays a role in mental disorders In schizophrenia and psychosis risk factors include migration and discrimination childhood trauma bereavement or separation in families recreational use of drugs and urbanicity In anxiety risk factors may include parenting factors including parental rejection lack of parental warmth high hostility harsh discipline high maternal negative affect anxious childrearing modelling of dysfunctional and drugabusing behavior and child abuse emotional physical and sexual Adults with imbalance work to life are at higher risk for developing anxiety For bipolar disorder stress such as childhood adversity is not a specific cause but does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness Drug use Mental disorders are associated with drug use including cannabis alcohol and caffeine use of which appears to promote anxiety For psychosis and schizophrenia usage of a number of drugs has been associated with development of the disorder including cannabis cocaine and amphetamines There has been debate regarding the relationship between usage of cannabis and bipolar disorder Cannabis has also been associated with depression Adolescents are at increased risk for tobacco alcohol and drug use Peer pressure is the main reason why adolescents start using substances At this age the use of substances could be detrimental to the development of the brain and place them at higher risk of developing a mental disorder Chronic disease People living with chronic conditions like HIV and diabetes are at higher risk of developing a mental disorder People living with diabetes experience significant stress from the biological impact of the disease which places them at risk for developing anxiety and depression Diabetic patients also have to deal with emotional stress trying to manage the disease Conditions like heart disease stroke respiratory conditions cancer and arthritis increase the risk of developing a mental disorder when compared to the general population Personality traits Risk factors for mental illness include a propensity for high neuroticism or emotional instability In anxiety risk factors may include temperament and attitudes eg pessimism Causal models Mental disorders can arise from multiple sources and in many cases there is no single accepted or consistent cause currently established An eclectic or pluralistic mix of models may be used to explain particular disorders The primary paradigm of contemporary mainstream Western psychiatry is said to be the biopsychosocial model which incorporates biological psychological and social factors although this may not always be applied in practice Biological psychiatry follows a biomedical model where many mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience A common assumption is that disorders may have resulted from genetic and developmental vulnerabilities exposed by stress in life for example in a diathesisstress model although there are various views on what causes differences between individuals Some types of mental disorders may be viewed as primarily neurodevelopmental disorders Evolutionary psychology may be used as an overall explanatory theory while attachment theory is another kind of evolutionarypsychological approach sometimes applied in the context of mental disorders Psychoanalytic theories have continued to evolve alongside and cognitivebehavioral and systemicfamily approaches A distinction is sometimes made between a medical model or a social model of psychiatric disability Diagnosis Psychiatrists seek to provide a medical diagnosis of individuals by an assessment of symptoms signs and impairment associated with particular types of mental disorder Other mental health professionals such as clinical psychologists may or may not apply the same diagnostic categories to their clinical formulation of a clients difficulties and circumstances The majority of mental health problems are at least initially assessed and treated by family physicians in the UK general practitioners during consultations who may refer a patient on for more specialist diagnosis in acute or chronic cases Routine diagnostic practice in mental health services typically involves an interview known as a mental status examination where evaluations are made of appearance and behavior selfreported symptoms mental health history and current life circumstances The views of other professionals relatives or other third parties may be taken into account A physical examination to check for ill health or the effects of medications or other drugs may be conducted Psychological testing is sometimes used via paperandpen or computerized questionnaires which may include algorithms based on ticking off standardized diagnostic criteria and in rare specialist cases neuroimaging tests may be requested but such methods are more commonly found in research studies than routine clinical practice Time and budgetary constraints often limit practicing psychiatrists from conducting more thorough diagnostic evaluations It has been found that most clinicians evaluate patients using an unstructured openended approach with limited training in evidencebased assessment methods and that inaccurate diagnosis may be common in routine practice In addition comorbidity is very common in psychiatric diagnosis where the same person meets the criteria for more than one disorder On the other hand a person may have several different difficulties only some of which meet the criteria for being diagnosed There may be specific problems with accurate diagnosis in developing countries More structured approaches are being increasingly used to measure levels of mental illness HoNOS is the most widely used measure in English mental health services being used by at least 61 trusts In HoNOS a score of 04 is given for each of 12 factors based on functional living capacity Research has been supportive of HoNOS although some questions have been asked about whether it provides adequate coverage of the range and complexity of mental illness problems and whether the fact that often only 3 of the 12 scales vary over time gives enough subtlety to accurately measure outcomes of treatment Criticism Since the 1980s Paula Caplan has been concerned about the subjectivity of psychiatric diagnosis and people being arbitrarily slapped with a psychiatric label Caplan says because psychiatric diagnosis is unregulated doctors are not required to spend much time interviewing patients or to seek a second opinion The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders can lead a psychiatrist to focus on narrow checklists of symptoms with little consideration of what is actually causing the persons problems So according to Caplan getting a psychiatric diagnosis and label often stands in the way of recovery In 2013 psychiatrist Allen Frances wrote a paper entitled The New Crisis of Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis which said that psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests Frances was also concerned about unpredictable overdiagnosis For many years marginalized psychiatrists such as Peter Breggin Thomas Szasz and outside critics such as Stuart A Kirk have been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality More recently these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the American Psychiatric Association eg Robert Spitzer Allen Frances A 2002 editorial in the British Medical Journal warned of inappropriate medicalization leading to disease mongering where the boundaries of the definition of illnesses are expanded to include personal problems as medical problems or risks of diseases are emphasized to broaden the market for medications Gary Greenberg a psychoanalyst in his book the Book of Woe argues that mental illness is really about suffering and how the DSM creates diagnostic labels to categorize peoples suffering Indeed the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz in his book the Medicalization of Everyday Life also argues that what is psychiatric illness is not always biological in nature ie social problems poverty etc and may even be a part of the human condition Potential routine use of MRIfMRI in diagnosis in 2018 the American Psychological Association commissioned a review to reach a consensus on whether modern clinical MRIfMRI will be able to be used in the diagnosis of mental health disorders The criteria presented by the APA stated that the biomarkers used in diagnosis should have a sensitivity of at least 80 for detecting a particular psychiatric disorder should have a specificity of at least 80 for distinguishing this disorder from other psychiatric or medical disorders should be reliable reproducible and ideally be noninvasive simple to perform and inexpensive proposed biomarkers should be verified by 2 independent studies each by a different investigator and different population samples and published in a peerreviewed journal The review concluded that although neuroimaging diagnosis may technically be feasible very large studies are needed to evaluate specific biomarkers which were not available Prevention The 2004 WHO report Prevention of Mental Disorders stated that Prevention of these disorders is obviously one of the most effective ways to reduce the disease burden The 2011 European Psychiatric Association EPA guidance on prevention of mental disorders states There is considerable evidence that various psychiatric conditions can be prevented through the implementation of effective evidencebased interventions A 2011 UK Department of Health report on the economic case for mental health promotion and mental illness prevention found that many interventions are outstandingly good value for money low in cost and often become selffinancing over time saving public expenditure In 2016 the National Institute of Mental Health reaffirmed prevention as a research priority area Parenting may affect the childs mental health and evidence suggests that helping parents to be more effective with their children can address mental health needs Universal prevention aimed at a population that has no increased risk for developing a mental disorder such as school programs or mass media campaigns need very high numbers of people to show effect sometimes known as the power problem Approaches to overcome this are 1 focus on highincidence groups eg by targeting groups with high risk factors 2 use multiple interventions to achieve greater and thus more statistically valid effects 3 use cumulative metaanalyses of many trials and 4 run very large trials Management Treatment and support for mental disorders are provided in psychiatric hospitals clinics or a range of community mental health services In some countries services are increasingly based on a recovery approach intended to support individuals personal journey to gain the kind of life they want There is a range of different types of treatment and what is most suitable depends on the disorder and the individual Many things have been found to help at least some people and a placebo effect may play a role in any intervention or medication In a minority of cases individuals may be treated against their will which can cause particular difficulties depending on how it is carried out and perceived Compulsory treatment while in the community versus noncompulsory treatment does not appear to make much of a difference except by maybe decreasing victimization Lifestyle Lifestyle strategies including dietary changes exercise and quitting smoking may be of benefit Therapy There is also a wide range of psychotherapists including family therapy counselors and public health professionals In addition there are peer support roles where personal experience of similar issues is the primary source of expertise A major option for many mental disorders is psychotherapy There are several main types Cognitive behavioral therapy CBT is widely used and is based on modifying the patterns of thought and behavior associated with a particular disorder Other psychotherapies include dialectic behavioral therapy DBT and interpersonal psychotherapy IPT Psychoanalysis addressing underlying psychic conflicts and defenses has been a dominant school of psychotherapy and is still in use Systemic therapy or family therapy is sometimes used addressing a network of significant others as well as an individual Some psychotherapies are based on a humanistic approach There are many specific therapies used for particular disorders which may be offshoots or hybrids of the above types Mental health professionals often employ an eclectic or integrative approach Much may depend on the therapeutic relationship and there may be problems with trust confidentiality and engagement Medication A major option for many mental disorders is psychiatric medication and there are several main groups Antidepressants are used for the treatment of clinical depression as well as often for anxiety and a range of other disorders Anxiolytics including sedatives are used for anxiety disorders and related problems such as insomnia Mood stabilizers are used primarily in bipolar disorder Antipsychotics are used for psychotic disorders notably for positive symptoms in schizophrenia and also increasingly for a range of other disorders Stimulants are commonly used notably for ADHD Despite the different conventional names of the drug groups there may be considerable overlap in the disorders for which they are actually indicated and there may also be offlabel use of medications There can be problems with adverse effects of medication and adherence to them and there is also criticism of pharmaceutical marketing and professional conflicts of interest However these medications in combination with nonpharmacological methods such as cognitivebehavioral therapy CBT are seen to be most effective in treating mental disorders Other Electroconvulsive therapy ECT is sometimes used in severe cases when other interventions for severe intractable depression have failed ECT is usually indicated for treatment resistant depression severe vegetative symptoms psychotic depression intense suicidal ideation depression during pregnancy and catatonia Psychosurgery is considered experimental but is advocated by some neurologists in certain rare cases Counseling professional and cocounseling between peers may be used Psychoeducation programs may provide people with the information to understand and manage their problems Creative therapies are sometimes used including music therapy art therapy or drama therapy Lifestyle adjustments and supportive measures are often used including peer support selfhelp groups for mental health and supported housing or supported employment including social firms Some advocate dietary supplements Reasonable accommodations adjustments and supports might be put in place to help an individual cope and succeed in environments despite potential disability related to mental health problems This could include an emotional support animal or specifically trained psychiatric service dog As of 2019 cannabis is specifically not recommended as a treatment Epidemiology Mental disorders are common Worldwide more than one in three people in most countries report sufficient criteria for at least one at some point in their life In the United States 46 qualify for a mental illness at some point An ongoing survey indicates that anxiety disorders are the most common in all but one country followed by mood disorders in all but two countries while substance disorders and impulsecontrol disorders were consistently less prevalent Rates varied by region A review of anxiety disorder surveys in different countries found average lifetime prevalence estimates of 166 with women having higher rates on average A review of mood disorder surveys in different countries found lifetime rates of 67 for major depressive disorder higher in some studies and in women and 08 for Bipolar I disorder In the United States the frequency of disorder is anxiety disorder 288 mood disorder 208 impulsecontrol disorder 248 or substance use disorder 146 A 2004 crossEurope study found that approximately one in four people reported meeting criteria at some point in their life for at least one of the DSMIV disorders assessed which included mood disorders 139 anxiety disorders 136 or alcohol disorder 52 Approximately one in ten met the criteria within a 12month period Women and younger people of either gender showed more cases of the disorder A 2005 review of surveys in 16 European countries found that 27 of adult Europeans are affected by at least one mental disorder in a 12month period An international review of studies on the prevalence of schizophrenia found an average median figure of 04 for lifetime prevalence it was consistently lower in poorer countries Studies of the prevalence of personality disorders PDs have been fewer and smallerscale but one broad Norwegian survey found a fiveyear prevalence of almost 1 in 7 134 Rates for specific disorders ranged from 08 to 28 differing across countries and by gender educational level and other factors A US survey that incidentally screened for personality disorder found a rate of 1479 Approximately 7 of a preschool pediatric sample were given a psychiatric diagnosis in one clinical study and approximately 10 of 1 and 2yearolds receiving developmental screening have been assessed as having significant emotionalbehavioral problems based on parent and pediatrician reports While rates of psychological disorders are often the same for men and women women tend to have a higher rate of depression Each year 73 million women are affected by major depression and suicide is ranked 7th as the cause of death for women between the ages of 2059 Depressive disorders account for close to 419 of the psychiatric disabilities among women compared to 293 among men History Ancient civilizations Ancient civilizations described and treated a number of mental disorders Mental illnesses were well known in ancient Mesopotamia where diseases and mental disorders were believed to be caused by specific deities Because hands symbolized control over a person mental illnesses were known as hands of certain deities One psychological illness was known as Qt Itar meaning Hand of Ishtar Others were known as Hand of Shamash Hand of the Ghost and Hand of the God Descriptions of these illnesses however are so vague that it is usually impossible to determine which illnesses they correspond to in modern terminology Mesopotamian doctors kept detailed record of their patients hallucinations and assigned spiritual meanings to them The royal family of Elam was notorious for its members often being insane The Greeks coined terms for melancholy hysteria and phobia and developed the humorism theory Mental disorders were described and treatments developed in Persia Arabia and in the medieval Islamic world Europe Middle Ages Conceptions of madness in the Middle Ages in Christian Europe were a mixture of the divine diabolical magical and humoral and transcendental In the early modern period some people with mental disorders may have been victims of the witchhunts While not every witch and sorcerer accused were mentally ill all mentally ill were considered to be witches or sorcerers Many terms for mental disorders that found their way into everyday use first became popular in the 16th and 17th centuries Eighteenth century By the end of the 17th century and into the Enlightenment madness was increasingly seen as an organic physical phenomenon with no connection to the soul or moral responsibility Asylum care was often harsh and treated people like wild animals but towards the end of the 18th century a moral treatment movement gradually developed Clear descriptions of some syndromes may be rare before the 19th century Nineteenth century Industrialization and population growth led to a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country in the 19th century Numerous different classification schemes and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities and the term psychiatry was coined 1808 though medical superintendents were still known as alienists Twentieth century The turn of the 20th century saw the development of psychoanalysis which would later come to the fore along with Kraepelins classification scheme Asylum inmates were increasingly referred to as patients and asylums were renamed as hospitals Europe and the United States Early in the 20th century in the United States a mental hygiene movement developed aiming to prevent mental disorders Clinical psychology and social work developed as professions World War I saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed shell shock World War II saw the development in the US of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders The International Classification of Diseases ICD also developed a section on mental disorders The term stress having emerged from endocrinology work in the 1930s was increasingly applied to mental disorders Electroconvulsive therapy insulin shock therapy lobotomies and the neuroleptic chlorpromazine came to be used by midcentury In the 1960s there were many challenges to the concept of mental illness itself These challenges came from psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz who argued that mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts from sociologists such as Erving Goffman who said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls nonconformists from behavioral psychologists who challenged psychiatrys fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena and from gay rights activists who criticised the APAs listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder A study published in Science by Rosenhan received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis Deinstitutionalization gradually occurred in the West with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of community mental health services A consumersurvivor movement gained momentum Other kinds of psychiatric medication gradually came into use such as psychic energizers later antidepressants and lithium Benzodiazepines gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression until dependency problems curtailed their popularity Advances in neuroscience genetics and psychology led to new research agendas Cognitive behavioral therapy and other psychotherapies developed The DSM and then ICD adopted new criteriabased classifications and the number of official diagnoses saw a large expansion Through the 1990s new SSRItype antidepressants became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world as later did antipsychotics Also during the 1990s a recovery approach developed Africa and Nigeria Most Africans view mental disturbances as external spiritual attack on the person Those who have a mental illness are thought to be under a spell or bewitched Often than usual People view a mentally ill person as possessed of an evil spirit and is seen as more of sociological perspective than a psychological order The WHO estimated that fewer than 10 of mentally ill Nigerians have access to a psychiatrist or health worker because there is a low ratio of mentalhealth specialists available in a country of 200 million people WHO estimates that the number of mentally ill Nigerians ranges from 40 million to 60 million Disorders such as depression anxiety schizophrenia personality disorder old agerelated disorder and substanceabuse disorder are common in Nigeria as in other countries in Africa Nigeria is still nowhere near being equipped to solve prevailing mental health challenges With little scientific research carried out coupled with insufficient mentalhealth hospitals in the country traditional healers provide specialized psychotherapy care to those that require their services and pharmacotherapy Society and culture Different societies or cultures even different individuals in a subculture can disagree as to what constitutes optimal versus pathological biological and psychological functioning Research has demonstrated that cultures vary in the relative importance placed on for example happiness autonomy or social relationships for pleasure Likewise the fact that a behavior pattern is valued accepted encouraged or even statistically normative in a culture does not necessarily mean that it is conducive to optimal psychological functioning People in all cultures find some behaviors bizarre or even incomprehensible But just what they feel is bizarre or incomprehensible is ambiguous and subjective These differences in determination can become highly contentious The process by which conditions and difficulties come to be defined and treated as medical conditions and problems and thus come under the authority of doctors and other health professionals is known as medicalization or pathologization Mental illness in the Latin American community There is a perception in Latin American communities especially among older people that discussing problems with mental health can create embarrassment and shame for the family This results in fewer people seeking treatment Latin Americans from the US are slightly more likely to have a mental health disorder than firstgeneration Latin American immigrants although differences between ethnic groups were found to disappear after adjustment for place of birth From 2015 to 2018 rates of serious mental illness in young adult Latin Americans increased by 60 from 4 to 64 The prevalence of major depressive episodes in young and adult Latin Americans increased from 84 to 113 More than a third of Latin Americans reported more than one bad mental health day in the last three months The rate of suicide among Latin Americans was about half the rate of nonLatin American white Americans in 2018 and this was the secondleading cause of death among Latin Americans ages 15 to 34 However Latin American suicide rates rose steadily after 2020 in relation to the COVID19 pandemic even as the national rate declined Family relations are an integral part of the Latin American community Some research has shown that Latin Americans are more likely rely on family bonds or familismo as a source of therapy while struggling with mental health issues Because Latin Americans have a high rate of religiosity and because there is less stigma associated with religion than with psychiatric services religion may play a more important therapeutic role for the mentally ill in Latin American communities However research has also suggested that religion may also play a role in stigmatizing mental illness in Latin American communities which can discourage community members from seeking professional help Religion Religious spiritual or transpersonal experiences and beliefs meet many criteria of delusional or psychotic disorders A belief or experience can sometimes be shown to produce distress or disabilitythe ordinary standard for judging mental disorders There is a link between religion and schizophrenia a complex mental disorder characterized by a difficulty in recognizing reality regulating emotional responses and thinking in a clear and logical manner Those with schizophrenia commonly report some type of religious delusion and religion itself may be a trigger for schizophrenia Movements Controversy has often surrounded psychiatry and the term antipsychiatry was coined by the psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 The antipsychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients and psychiatrys history involves what may now be seen as dangerous treatments Electroconvulsive therapy was one of these which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s Lobotomy was another practice that was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal Diazepam and other sedatives were sometimes overprescribed which led to an epidemic of dependence There was also concern about the large increase in prescribing psychiatric drugs for children Some charismatic psychiatrists came to personify the movement against psychiatry The most influential of these was RD Laing who wrote a series of bestselling books including The Divided Self Thomas Szasz wrote The Myth of Mental Illness Some expatient groups have become militantly antipsychiatric often referring to themselves as survivors Giorgio Antonucci has questioned the basis of psychiatry through his work on the dismantling of two psychiatric hospitals in the city of Imola carried out from 1973 to 1996 The consumersurvivor movement also known as usersurvivor movement is made up of individuals and organizations representing them who are clients of mental health services or who consider themselves survivors of psychiatric interventions Activists campaign for improved mental health services and for more involvement and empowerment within mental health services policies and wider society Patient advocacy organizations have expanded with increasing deinstitutionalization in developed countries working to challenge the stereotypes stigma and exclusion associated with psychiatric conditions There is also a carers rights movement of people who help and support people with mental health conditions who may be relatives and who often work in difficult and timeconsuming circumstances with little acknowledgement and without pay An antipsychiatry movement fundamentally challenges mainstream psychiatric theory and practice including in some cases asserting that psychiatric concepts and diagnoses of mental illness are neither real nor useful Alternatively a movement for global mental health has emerged defined as the area of study research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide Cultural bias Diagnostic guidelines of the 2000s namely the DSM and to some extent the ICD have been criticized as having a fundamentally EuroAmerican outlook Opponents argue that even when diagnostic criteria are used across different cultures it does not mean that the underlying constructs have validity within those cultures as even reliable application can prove only consistency not legitimacy Advocating a more culturally sensitive approach critics such as Carl Bell and Marcello Maviglia contend that the cultural and ethnic diversity of individuals is often discounted by researchers and service providers Crosscultural psychiatrist Arthur Kleinman contends that the Western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the DSMIV Disorders or concepts from nonWestern or nonmainstream cultures are described as culturebound whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever revealing to Kleinman an underlying assumption that Western cultural phenomena are universal Kleinmans negative view towards the culturebound syndrome is largely shared by other crosscultural critics Common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented nonWestern mental disorders still left out and frustration that even those included are often misinterpreted or misrepresented Many mainstream psychiatrists are dissatisfied with the new culturebound diagnoses although for partly different reasons Robert Spitzer a lead architect of the DSMIII has argued that adding cultural formulations was an attempt to appease cultural critics and has stated that they lack any scientific rationale or support Spitzer also posits that the new culturebound diagnoses are rarely used maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved In general mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid crosscultural factors are either irrelevant or are significant only to specific symptom presentations Clinical conceptions of mental illness also overlap with personal and cultural values in the domain of morality so much so that it is sometimes argued that separating the two is impossible without fundamentally redefining the essence of being a particular person in a society In clinical psychiatry persistent distress and disability indicate an internal disorder requiring treatment but in another context that same distress and disability can be seen as an indicator of emotional struggle and the need to address social and structural problems This dichotomy has led some academics and clinicians to advocate a postmodernist conceptualization of mental distress and wellbeing Such approaches along with crosscultural and heretical psychologies centered on alternative cultural and ethnic and racebased identities and experiences stand in contrast to the mainstream psychiatric communitys alleged avoidance of any explicit involvement with either morality or culture In many countries there are attempts to challenge perceived prejudice against minority groups including alleged institutional racism within psychiatric services There are also ongoing attempts to improve professional cross cultural sensitivity Laws and policies Threequarters of countries around the world have mental health legislation Compulsory admission to mental health facilities also known as involuntary commitment is a controversial topic It can impinge on personal liberty and the right to choose and carry the risk of abuse for political social and other reasons yet it can potentially prevent harm to self and others and assist some people in attaining their right to healthcare when they may be unable to decide in their own interests Because of this it is a concern of medical ethics All human rights oriented mental health laws require proof of the presence of a mental disorder as defined by internationally accepted standards but the type and severity of disorder that counts can vary in different jurisdictions The two most often used grounds for involuntary admission are said to be serious likelihood of immediate or imminent danger to self or others and the need for treatment Applications for someone to be involuntarily admitted usually come from a mental health practitioner a family member a close relative or a guardian Humanrightsoriented laws usually stipulate that independent medical practitioners or other accredited mental health practitioners must examine the patient separately and that there should be regular timebound review by an independent review body The individual should also have personal access to independent advocacy For involuntary treatment to be administered by force if necessary it should be shown that an individual lacks the mental capacity for informed consent ie to understand treatment information and its implications and therefore be able to make an informed choice to either accept or refuse Legal challenges in some areas have resulted in supreme court decisions that a person does not have to agree with a psychiatrists characterization of the issues as constituting an illness nor agree with a psychiatrists conviction in medication but only recognize the issues and the information about treatment options Proxy consent also known as surrogate or substituted decisionmaking may be transferred to a personal representative a family member or a legally appointed guardian Moreover patients may be able to make when they are considered well an advance directive stipulating how they wish to be treated should they be deemed to lack mental capacity in the future The right to supported decisionmaking where a person is helped to understand and choose treatment options before they can be declared to lack capacity may also be included in the legislation There should at the very least be shared decisionmaking as far as possible Involuntary treatment laws are increasingly extended to those living in the community for example outpatient commitment laws known by different names are used in New Zealand Australia the United Kingdom and most of the United States The World Health Organization reports that in many instances national mental health legislation takes away the rights of persons with mental disorders rather than protecting rights and is often outdated In 1991 the United Nations adopted the Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care which established minimum human rights standards of practice in the mental health field In 2006 the UN formally agreed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of disabled people including those with psychiatric disabilities The term insanity sometimes used colloquially as a synonym for mental illness is often used technically as a legal term The insanity defense may be used in a legal trial known as the mental disorder defence in some countries Perception and discrimination Stigma The social stigma associated with mental disorders is a widespread problem The US Surgeon General stated in 1999 that Powerful and pervasive stigma prevents people from acknowledging their own mental health problems much less disclosing them to others Additionally researcher Wulf Rssler in 2016 in his article The Stigma of Mental Disorders stated For millennia society did not treat persons suffering from depression autism schizophrenia and other mental illnesses much better than slaves or criminals they were imprisoned tortured or killed In the United States racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to experience mental health disorders often due to low socioeconomic status and discrimination In Taiwan people with mental disorders often face misconceptions from the general public These misconceptions include the belief that mental health issues stem from excessive worry having too much free time a lack of progress or ambition not taking life seriously neglecting reallife responsibilities mental weakness unwillingness to be resilient perfectionism or a lack of courage Employment discrimination is reported to play a significant part in the high rate of unemployment among those with a diagnosis of mental illness An Australian study found that having a psychiatric disability is a bigger barrier to employment than a physical disability The mentally ill are stigmatized in Chinese society and can not legally marry Efforts are being undertaken worldwide to eliminate the stigma of mental illness although the methods and outcomes used have sometimes been criticized Media and general public Media coverage of mental illness comprises predominantly negative and pejorative depictions for example of incompetence violence or criminality with far less coverage of positive issues such as accomplishments or human rights issues Such negative depictions including in childrens cartoons are thought to contribute to stigma and negative attitudes in the public and in those with mental health problems themselves although more sensitive or serious cinematic portrayals have increased in prevalence In the United States the Carter Center has created fellowships for journalists in South Africa the US and Romania to enable reporters to research and write stories on mental health topics Former US First Lady Rosalynn Carter began the fellowships not only to train reporters in how to sensitively and accurately discuss mental health and mental illness but also to increase the number of stories on these topics in the news media There is also a World Mental Health Day which in the United States and Canada falls within a Mental Illness Awareness Week The general public have been found to hold a strong stereotype of dangerousness and desire for social distance from individuals described as mentally ill A US national survey found that a higher percentage of people rate individuals described as displaying the characteristics of a mental disorder as likely to do something violent to others compared to the percentage of people who are rating individuals described as being troubled In the article Discrimination Against People with a Mental Health Diagnosis Qualitative Analysis of Reported Experiences an individual who has a mental disorder revealed that If people dont know me and dont know about the problems theyll talk to me quite happily Once theyve seen the problems or someones told them about me they tend to be a bit more wary In addition in the article Stigma and its Impact on HelpSeeking for Mental Disorders What Do We Know by George Schomerus and Matthias Angermeyer it is affirmed that Family doctors and psychiatrists have more pessimistic views about the outcomes for mental illnesses than the general public Jorm et al 1999 and mental health professionals hold more negative stereotypes about mentally ill patients but reassuringly they are less accepting of restrictions towards them Recent depictions in media have included leading characters successfully living with and managing a mental illness including in bipolar disorder in Homeland 2011 and posttraumatic stress disorder in Iron Man 3 2013 Violence Despite public or media opinion national studies have indicated that severe mental illness does not independently predict future violent behavior on average and is not a leading cause of violence in society There is a statistical association with various factors that do relate to violence in anyone such as substance use and various personal social and economic factors A 2015 review found that in the United States about 4 of violence is attributable to people diagnosed with mental illness and a 2014 study found that 75 of crimes committed by mentally ill people were directly related to the symptoms of their mental illness The majority of people with serious mental illness are never violent In fact findings consistently indicate that it is many times more likely that people diagnosed with a serious mental illness living in the community will be the victims rather than the perpetrators of violence In a study of individuals diagnosed with severe mental illness living in a US innercity area a quarter were found to have been victims of at least one violent crime over the course of a year a proportion eleven times higher than the innercity average and higher in every category of crime including violent assaults and theft People with a diagnosis may find it more difficult to secure prosecutions however due in part to prejudice and being seen as less credible However there are some specific diagnoses such as childhood conduct disorder or adult antisocial personality disorder or psychopathy which are defined by or are inherently associated with conduct problems and violence There are conflicting findings about the extent to which certain specific symptoms notably some kinds of psychosis hallucinations or delusions that can occur in disorders such as schizophrenia delusional disorder or mood disorder are linked to an increased risk of serious violence on average The mediating factors of violent acts however are most consistently found to be mainly sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors such as being young male of lower socioeconomic status and in particular substance use including alcohol use to which some people may be particularly vulnerable Highprofile cases have led to fears that serious crimes such as homicide have increased due to deinstitutionalization but the evidence does not support this conclusion Violence that does occur in relation to mental disorder against the mentally ill or by the mentally ill typically occurs in the context of complex social interactions often in a family setting rather than between strangers It is also an issue in health care settings and the wider community Mental health The recognition and understanding of mental health conditions have changed over time and across cultures and there are still variations in definition assessment and classification although standard guideline criteria are widely used In many cases there appears to be a continuum between mental health and mental illness making diagnosis complex 39 According to the World Health Organization over a third of people in most countries report problems at some time in their life which meet the criteria for diagnosis of one or more of the common types of mental disorder Corey M Keyes has created a two continua model of mental illness and health which holds that both are related but distinct dimensions one continuum indicates the presence or absence of mental health the other the presence or absence of mental illness For example people with optimal mental health can also have a mental illness and people who have no mental illness can also have poor mental health Other animals Psychopathology in nonhuman primates has been studied since the mid20th century Over 20 behavioral patterns in captive chimpanzees have been documented as statistically abnormal for frequency severity or oddnesssome of which have also been observed in the wild Captive great apes show gross behavioral abnormalities such as stereotypy of movements selfmutilation disturbed emotional reactions mainly fear or aggression towards companions lack of speciestypical communications and generalized learned helplessness In some cases such behaviors are hypothesized to be equivalent to symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in humans such as depression anxiety disorders eating disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder Concepts of antisocial borderline and schizoid personality disorders have also been applied to nonhuman great apes The risk of anthropomorphism is often raised concerning such comparisons and assessment of nonhuman animals cannot incorporate evidence from linguistic communication However available evidence may range from nonverbal behaviorsincluding physiological responses and homologous facial displays and acoustic utterancesto neurochemical studies It is pointed out that human psychiatric classification is often based on statistical description and judgment of behaviors especially when speech or language is impaired and that the use of verbal selfreport is itself problematic and unreliable Psychopathology has generally been traced at least in captivity to adverse rearing conditions such as early separation of infants from mothers early sensory deprivation and extended periods of social isolation Studies have also indicated individual variation in temperament such as sociability or impulsiveness Particular causes of problems in captivity have included integration of strangers into existing groups and a lack of individual space in which context some pathological behaviors have also been seen as coping mechanisms Remedial interventions have included careful individually tailored resocialization programs behavior therapy environment enrichment and on rare occasions psychiatric drugs Socialization has been found to work 90 of the time in disturbed chimpanzees although restoration of functional sexuality and caregiving is often not achieved Laboratory researchers sometimes try to develop animal models of human mental disorders including by inducing or treating symptoms in animals through genetic neurological chemical or behavioral manipulation but this has been criticized on empirical grounds and opposed on animal rights grounds See also 50 Signs of Mental Illness List of mental disorders Mental disorders and LGBTQ Mental

    title: "Autism spectrum disorder",
    originalContent:
      "Autism or autism spectrum disorder ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive restricted and inflexible patterns of behavior interests and activities deficits in social communication and social interaction and the presence of high or low sensory sensitivity A formal diagnosis requires that symptoms cause significant impairment in multiple functional domains in addition to being atypical or excessive for the individuals age and sociocultural context Autism manifests in a variety of ways with its severity and support needs varying widely across the underlying spectrum For example some autistic people are nonverbal while others have proficient spoken language Public health authorities classify autism as a neurodevelopmental disorder but the autism rights movement and some researchers disagree with the classification From their point of view autistic people may be diagnosed with a disability of some sort but that disability may be rooted in the systemic structures of a society rather than in the person On the contrary other scientists argue that autism impairs functioning in many ways that are inherent to the disorder itself and unrelated to society The neurodiversity perspective has led to significant controversy among those who are autistic and advocates practitioners and charities The precise causes of autism are unknown in most individual cases Research shows that the disorder is highly heritable and polygenic and neurobiological risks from the environment are also relevant Autism frequently cooccurs with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD epilepsy and intellectual disability and research indicates that autistic people have significantly higher rates of LGBTQ identities and feelings than the general population Disagreements persist about what should be included as part of the diagnosis whether there are meaningful subtypes or stages of autism and the significance of autismassociated traits in the wider population The combination of broader criteria increased awareness and the potential increase of actual prevalence has led to considerably increased estimates of autism prevalence since the 1990s The WHO estimates about 1 in 100 children had autism between 2012 and 2021 as that was the average estimate in studies during that period with a trend of increasing prevalence over time This increasing prevalence has reinforced the myth perpetuated by antivaccine activists that autism is caused by vaccines Boys are also significantly far more frequently diagnosed than girls There is no known cure for autism and some advocates dispute the need to find one Interventions such as applied behavior analysis ABA speech therapy and occupational therapy aim to teach children selfcare social and communicative skills Guidelines from the Centres for Disease Control CDC and European Society for Child Adolescent Psychiatry endorse the use of ABA on the grounds that it reduces symptoms impairing daily functioning and quality of life although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence cites a lack of highquality evidence to support its use Additionally some in the autism rights movement oppose its application due to a perception that it emphasises normalisation No medication has been shown to reduce ASDs core symptoms but some can alleviate comorbid issues Classification Spectrum model Before the DSM5 2013 and ICD11 2022 diagnostic manuals were adopted ASD was found under the diagnostic category pervasive developmental disorder The previous system relied on a set of closely related and overlapping diagnoses such as Asperger syndrome and the syndrome formerly known as Kanner syndrome This created unclear boundaries between the terms so for the DSM5 and ICD11 a spectrum approach was taken The new system is also more restrictive meaning fewer people qualify for diagnosis The DSM5 and ICD11 use different categorization tools to define this spectrum DSM5 uses a level system which ranks how in need of support the patient is level 1 being the mildest and level 3 the severest while the ICD11 system has two axes intellectual impairment and language impairment as these are seen as the most crucial factors Autism is currently defined as a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that is generally thought to cover a broad and deep spectrum manifesting very differently from one person to another Some have high support needs may be nonspeaking and experience developmental delays this is more likely with other coexisting diagnoses Others have relatively low support needs they may have more typical speechlanguage and intellectual skills but atypical socialconversation skills narrowly focused interests and wordy pedantic communication They may still require significant support in some areas of their lives The spectrum model should not be understood as a continuum running from mild to severe but instead means that autism can present very differently in each person How it presents in a person can depend on context and may vary over time While the DSM and ICD greatly influence each other there are also differences For example Rett syndrome was included in ASD in the DSM5 but in the ICD11 it was excluded and placed in the chapter on Developmental Anomalies The ICD and the DSM change over time and there has been collaborative work toward a convergence of the two since 1980 when DSMIII was published and ICD9 was current including more rigorous biological assessmentin place of historical experienceand a simplification of the classification system As of 2023 empirical and theoretical research is leading to a growing consensus among researchers that the established ASD criteria are ineffective descriptors of autism as a whole and that alternative research approaches must be encouraged such as going back to autism prototypes exploring new causal models of autism or developing transdiagnostic endophenotypes Proposed alternatives to the current disorderfocused spectrum model deconstruct autism into at least two separate phenomena 1 a nonpathological spectrum of behavioral traits in the population and 2 the neuropathological burden of rare genetic mutations and environmental risk factors potentially leading to neurodevelopmental and psychological disorders 3 governed by an individuals cognitive ability to compensate ICD The World Health Organizations International Classification of Diseases 11th revision ICD11 was released in June 2018 and came into full effect as of January 2022 It describes ASD as follows Autism spectrum disorder is characterised by persistent deficits in the ability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication and by a range of restricted repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour interests or activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individuals age and sociocultural context The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period typically in early childhood but symptoms may not become fully manifest until later when social demands exceed limited capacities Deficits are sufficiently severe to cause impairment in personal family social educational occupational or other important areas of functioning and are usually a pervasive feature of the individuals functioning observable in all settings although they may vary according to social educational or other context Individuals along the spectrum exhibit a full range of intellectual functioning and language abilities ICD11 was produced by professionals from 55 countries out of the 90 involved and is the most widely used reference worldwide DSM The American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition Text Revision DSM5TR released in 2022 is the current version of the DSM It is the predominant mental health diagnostic system used in the United States and Canada and is often used in Anglophone countries Its fifth edition DSM5 released in May 2013 was the first to define ASD as a single diagnosis which is still the case in the DSM5TR ASD encompasses previous diagnoses including the four traditional diagnoses of autismclassic autism Asperger syndrome childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified PDDNOSand the range of diagnoses that included the word autism Rather than distinguishing among these diagnoses the DSM5 and DSM5TR adopt a dimensional approach with one diagnostic category for disorders that fall under the autism spectrum umbrella Within that category the DSM5 and the DSM include a framework that differentiates each person by dimensions of symptom severity as well as by associated features ie the presence of other disorders or factors that likely contribute to the symptoms other neurodevelopmental or mental disorders intellectual disability or language impairment The symptom domains are a social communication and b restricted repetitive behaviors and there is the option of specifying a separate severitythe negative effect of the symptoms on the personfor each domain rather than just overall severity Before the DSM5 the DSM separated social deficits and communication deficits into two domains Further the DSM5 changed to an onset age in the early developmental period with a note that symptoms may manifest later when social demands exceed capabilities rather than the previous more restricted three years of age These changes remain in the DSM5TR Signs and symptoms Prediagnosis For many autistic people characteristics first appear during infancy or childhood and follow a steady course without remission different developmental timelines are described in more detail below Autistic people may be severely impaired in some respects but average or even superior in others Clinicians consider assessment for ASD when a patient shows Regular difficulties in social interaction or communication Restricted or repetitive behaviors often called stimming Resistance to changes or restricted interests These features are typically assessed with the following when appropriate Problems in obtaining or sustaining employment or education Difficulties in initiating or sustaining social relationships Connections with mental health or learning disability services A history of neurodevelopmental conditions including learning disabilities and ADHD or mental health conditions There are many signs associated with autism the presentation varies widely Common signs and symptoms include Abnormalities in eye contact Little or no babbling as an infant Not showing interest in indicated objects Delayed language skills eg having a smaller vocabulary than peers or difficulty expressing themselves in words Reduced interest in other children or caretakers possibly with more interest in objects Difficulty playing reciprocal games eg peekaboo Hyper or hyposensitivity to or unusual response to the smell texture sound taste or appearance of things Resistance to changes in routine Repetitive limited or otherwise unusual usage of toys eg lining up toys Repetition of words or phrases including echolalia Repetitive motions or movements including stimming Broader autism phenotype The broader autism phenotype describes people who may not have ASD but do have autistic traits such as abnormalities in eye contact and stimming Social and communication skills According to the medical model autistic people experience social communications impairments Until 2013 deficits in social function and communication were considered two separate symptom domains The current social communication domain criteria for autism diagnosis require people to have deficits across three social skills socialemotional reciprocity nonverbal communication and developing and sustaining relationships A deficitbased view predicts that autisticautistic interaction would be less effective than autisticnonautistic interactions or even nonfunctional But recent research has found that autisticautistic interactions are as effective in information transfer as interactions between nonautistics are and that communication breaks down only between autistics and nonautistics Also contrary to social cognitive deficit interpretations recent 2019 research recorded similar social cognitive performances in autistic and nonautistic adults with both of them rating autistic individuals less favorably than nonautistic individuals however autistic individuals showed more interest in engaging with autistic people than nonautistic people did and learning of a persons ASD diagnosis did not influence their interest level Thus there has been a recent shift to acknowledge that autistic people may simply respond and behave differently than people without ASD So far research has identified two unconventional features by which autistic people create shared understanding intersubjectivity a generous assumption of common ground that when understood led to rapid rapport and when not understood resulted in potentially disruptive utterances and a low demand for coordination that ameliorated many challenges associated with disruptive turns Autistic interests and thus conversational topics seem to be largely driven by an intense interest in specific topics monotropism Historically autistic children were said to be delayed in developing a theory of mind and the empathizingsystemizing theory has argued that while autistic people have compassion affective empathy for others with similar presentation of symptoms they have limited though not necessarily absent cognitive empathy This may present as social navety lower than average intuitive perception of the utility or meaning of body language social reciprocity or social expectations including the habitus social cues and some aspects of sarcasm which to some degree may also be due to comorbid alexithymia But recent research has increasingly questioned these findings as the double empathy problem theory 2012 argues that there is a lack of mutual understanding and empathy between both nonautistic persons and autistic individuals As communication is bidirectional research on communication difficulties has since also begun to study nonautistic behavior with researcher Catherine Crompton writing in 2020 that nonautistic people struggle to identify autistic mental states identify autistic facial expressions overestimate autistic egocentricity and are less willing to socially interact with autistic people Thus although nonautistic people are generally characterised as socially skilled these skills may not be functional or effectively applied when interacting with autistic people Any previously observed communication deficits of autistic people may thus have been constructed through a neurotypical bias in autism research which has come to be scrutinized for dehumanization objectification and stigmatization Recent research has proposed that autistics lack of readability and a neurotypical lack of effort to interpret atypical signals may cause a negative interaction loop increasingly driving both groups apart into two distinct groups with different social interaction styles Differences in verbal communication begin to be noticeable in childhood as many autistic children develop language skills at an uneven pace Verbal communication may be delayed or never developed nonverbal autism while reading ability may be present before school age hyperlexia Reduced joint attention seem to distinguish autistic from nonautistic infants Infants may show delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver In the second and third years autistic children may have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia The CDC estimated in 2015 that around 40 of autistic children do not speak at all Autistic adults verbal communication skills largely depend on when and how well speech is acquired during childhood Autistic people display atypical nonverbal behaviors or show differences in nonverbal communication They may make infrequent eye contact even when called by name or avoid it altogether This may be due to the high amount of sensory input received when making eye contact Autistic people often recognize fewer emotions and their meaning from others facial expressions and may not respond with facial expressions expected by their nonautistic peers Temple Grandin an autistic woman involved in autism activism described her inability to understand neurotypicals social communication as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on Mars Autistic people struggle to understand the social context and subtext of neurotypical conversational or printed situations and form different conclusions about the content Autistic people may not control the volume of their voice in different social settings At least half of autistic children have atypical prosody What may look like selfinvolvement or indifference to nonautistic people stems from autistic differences in recognizing how other people have their own personalities perspectives and interests Most published research focuses on the interpersonal relationship difficulties between autistic people and their nonautistic counterparts and how to solve them through teaching neurotypical social skills but newer research has also evaluated what autistic people want from friendships such as a sense of belonging and good mental health Children with ASD are more frequently involved in bullying situations than their nonautistic peers and predominantly experience bullying as victims rather than perpetrators or victimperpetrators especially after controlling for comorbid psychopathology Prioritizing dependability and intimacy in friendships during adolescence coupled with lowered friendship quantity and quality often lead to increased loneliness in autistic people As they progress through life autistic people observe and form a model of social patterns and develop coping mechanisms referred to as masking which have recently been found to come with psychological costs and a higher increased risk of suicidality Restricted and repetitive behaviors ASD includes a wide variety of characteristics Some of these include behavioral characteristics which widely range from slow development of social and learning skills to difficulties creating connections with other people Autistic people may experience these challenges with forming connections due to anxiety or depression which they are more likely to experience and as a result isolate themselves Other behavioral characteristics include abnormal responses to sensations such as sights sounds touch taste and smell and problems keeping a consistent speech rhythm The latter problem influences social skills leading to potential problems in understanding for interlocutors Autistic peoples behavioral characteristics typically influence development language and social competence Their behavioral characteristics can be observed as perceptual disturbances disturbances of development rate relating speech and language and motility The second core symptom of autism spectrum is a pattern of restricted and repetitive behaviors activities and interests In order to be diagnosed with ASD under the DSM5TR a person must have at least two of the following behaviors Repetitive behaviors Repetitive behaviors such as rocking hand flapping finger flicking head banging or repeating phrases or sounds These behaviors may occur constantly or only when the person gets stressed anxious or upset These behaviors are also known as stimming Resistance to change A strict adherence to routines such as eating certain foods in a specific order or taking the same path to school every day The person may become distressed if there is a change or disruption to their routine Restricted interests An excessive interest in a particular activity topic or hobby and devoting all their attention to it For example young children might completely focus on things that spin and ignore everything else Older children might try to learn everything about a single topic such as the weather or sports and perseverate or talk about it constantly Sensory reactivity An unusual reaction to certain sensory inputs such as negative reaction to specific sounds or textures fascination with lights or movements or apparent indifference to pain or heat Autistic people can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the Repetitive Behavior ScaleRevised RBSR categorizes as follows Stereotyped behaviors Repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking Compulsive behaviors Timeconsuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that a person feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in a specific order checking things or handwashing Sameness Resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted Ritualistic behavior Unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors Selfinjurious behaviors Behaviors such as eyepoking skinpicking handbiting and headbanging Selfinjury and suicide Selfinjurious behaviors are relatively common in autistic people and can include headbanging selfcutting selfbiting and hairpulling Some of these can result in serious injury or death Autistic people are about three times as likely as nonautistic people to engage in selfinjury Theories about the cause of selfinjurious behavior in children with developmental delay including autistic children include Frequency or continuation of selfinjurious behavior can be influenced by environmental factors eg reward in return for halting selfinjurious behavior This theory does not apply to younger children with autism There is some evidence that frequency of selfinjurious behavior can be reduced by removing or modifying environmental factors that reinforce the behavior 1012 Higher rates of selfinjury are noted in socially isolated autistic people Studies have shown that socialization skills are related factors to selfinjurious behavior for autistic people Selfinjury could be a response to modulate pain perception when chronic pain or other health problems that cause pain are present 1213 Abnormal basal ganglia connectivity may predispose to selfinjurious behavior 13 Risk factors for selfharm and suicidality include circumstances that could affect anyone such as mental health problems eg anxiety disorder and social problems eg unemployment and social isolation plus factors that affect only autistic people such as actively trying to behave like like a neurotypical person which is called masking Rates of suicidality vary significantly depending upon what is being measured This is partly because questionnaires developed for neurotypical subjects are not always valid for autistic people As of 2023 the Suicidal Behaviours QuestionnaireAutism Spectrum Conditions SBQASC is the only test validated for autistic people According to some estimates about a quarter of autistic youth and a third of all autistic people have experienced suicidal ideation at some point Rates of suicidal ideation are the same for people formally diagnosed with autism and people who have typical intelligence and are believed to have autism but have not been diagnosed Although most people who attempt suicide are not autistic autistic people are about three times as likely as nonautistic people to make a suicide attempt Less than 10 of autistic youth have attempted suicide but 15 to 25 autistic adults have The rates of suicide attempts are the same among people formally diagnosed with autism and those who have typical intelligence and are believed to have autism but have not been diagnosed The suicide risk is lower among cisgender autistic males and autistic people with intellectual disabilities The rate of suicide results in a global excess mortality among autistic people equal to approximately 2 of all suicide deaths each year Burnout Studies have supported the common belief that autistic people become exhausted or burnt out in some situations Other features Autistic people may have symptoms that do not contribute to the official diagnosis but that can affect the person or the family Some autistic people show unusual or notable abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to rare talents in mathematics music or artistic reproduction which in exceptional cases are considered a part of the savant syndrome One study describes how some autistic people show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of autistic people and are considered core features by some More generally autistic people tend to show a spiky skills profile with strong abilities in some areas contrasting with much weaker abilities in others Differences between the previously recognized disorders under the autism spectrum are greater for underresponsivity for example walking into things than for overresponsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements An estimated 6080 of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper Pathological demand avoidance can occur People with this set of autistic symptoms are more likely to refuse to do what is asked or expected of them even to activities they enjoy Unusual or atypical eating behavior occurs in about threequarters of children with ASD to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator Selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur Problematic digital media use Possible causes Exactly what causes autism remains unknown It was long mostly presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for the social and nonsocial components of ASDs symptoms described as a triad in the classic autism criteria But it is increasingly suspected that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often cooccur It is unlikely that ASD has a single cause many risk factors identified in the research literature may contribute to ASD These include genetics prenatal and perinatal factors meaning factors during pregnancy or very early infancy neuroanatomical abnormalities and environmental factors It is possible to identify general factors but much more difficult to pinpoint specific ones Given the current state of knowledge prediction can only be of a global nature and so requires the use of general markers Biological subgroups Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior Syndromic autism and nonsyndromic autism Autism spectrum disorder ASD can be classified into two categories syndromic autism and nonsyndromic autism Syndromic autism refers to cases where ASD is one of the characteristics associated with a broader medical condition or syndrome representing about 25 of ASD cases The causes of syndromic autism are often known and monogenic disorders account for approximately 5 of these cases Nonsyndromic autism also known as classic or idiopathic autism represents the majority of cases and its cause is typically polygenic and unknown Genetics Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected people and their parents But most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified Typically autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian singlegene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASD have been shown to selectively cause ASD Numerous genes have been found with only small effects attributable to any particular gene Most loci individually explain less than 1 of cases of autism As of 2018 it appeared that between 74 and 93 of ASD risk is heritable After an older child is diagnosed with ASD 7 to 20 of subsequent children are likely to be as well If parents have one autistic child they have a 2 to 8 chance of having a second child who is autistic If the autistic child is an identical twin the other will be affected 36 to 95 of the time A fraternal twin is affected up to 31 of the time The large number of autistic people with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis Hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome As of 2018 understanding of genetic risk factors had shifted from a focus on a few alleles to an understanding that genetic involvement in ASD is probably diffuse depending on a large number of variants some of which are common and have a small effect and some of which are rare and have a large effect The most common gene disrupted with large effect rare variants appeared to be CHD8 but less than 05 of autistic people have such a mutation The gene CHD8 encodes the protein chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 which is a chromatin regulator enzyme that is essential during fetal development CHD8 is an adenosine triphosphate ATPdependent enzyme The protein contains an Snf2 helicase domain that is responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate ADP CHD8 encodes a DNA helicase that functions as a repressor of transcription remodeling chromatin structure by altering the position of nucleosomes CHD8 negatively regulates Wnt signaling Wnt signaling is important in the vertebrate early development and morphogenesis It is believed that CHD8 also recruits the linker histone H1 and causes the repression of catenin and p53 target genes The importance of CHD8 can be observed in studies where CHD8knockout mice died after 55 embryonic days because of widespread p53induced apoptosis Some studies have determined the role of CHD8 in autism spectrum disorder ASD CHD8 expression significantly increases during human midfetal development The chromatin remodeling activity and its interaction with transcriptional regulators have shown to play an important role in ASD aetiology The developing mammalian brain has conserved CHD8 target regions that are associated with ASD risk genes The knockdown of CHD8 in human neural stem cells results in dysregulation of ASD risk genes that are targeted by CHD8 Recently CHD8 has been associated with the regulation of long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs and the regulation of X chromosome inactivation XCI initiation via regulation of Xist long noncoding RNA the master regulator of XCI though competitive binding to Xist regulatory regions Some ASD is associated with clearly genetic conditions like fragile X syndrome but only around 2 of autistic people have fragile X Hypotheses from evolutionary psychiatry suggest that these genes persist because they are linked to human inventiveness intelligence or systemising Current research suggests that genes that increase susceptibility to ASD are ones that control protein synthesis in neuronal cells in response to cell needs activity and adhesion of neuronal cells synapse formation and remodeling and excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitter balance Therefore although up to 1000 different genes are thought to increase the risk of ASD all of them eventually affect normal neural development and connectivity between different functional areas of the brain in a similar manner that is characteristic of an ASD brain Some of these genes are known to modulate production of the GABA neurotransmitter the nervous systems main inhibitory neurotransmitter These GABArelated genes are underexpressed in an ASD brain On the other hand genes controlling expression of glial and immune cells in the brain eg astrocytes and microglia respectively are overexpressed which correlates with increased number of glial and immune cells found in postmortem ASD brains Some genes under investigation in ASD pathophysiology are those that affect the mTOR signaling pathway which supports cell growth and survival All these genetic variants contribute to the development of the autism spectrum but it cannot be guaranteed that they are determinants for the development ASD may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and X linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often such as the imprinted brain hypothesis and the extreme male brain theory Early life Several prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors for autism These risk factors include maternal gestational diabetes maternal and paternal age over 30 bleeding during pregnancy after the first trimester use of certain prescription medication eg valproate during pregnancy and meconium in the amniotic fluid Research is not conclusive on the relation of these factors to autism but each of them has been identified more frequently in children with autism compared to their siblings who do not have autism and other typically developing youth While it is unclear if any single factors during the prenatal phase affect the risk of autism complications during pregnancy may be a risk There are also studies being done to test whether certain types of regressive autism have an autoimmune basis Maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with ASD in both term and preterm infants Maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system Systematic reviews and metaanalyses have found that maternal prenatal infections prenatal antibiotic exposure and postterm pregnancies are associated with increased risk of ASD in children Exposure to air pollution during child pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism Environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents PCBs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress Some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven Disproven vaccine hypothesis Parents may first become aware of ASD symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination This has led to unsupported and disproven theories blaming vaccine overload the vaccine preservative thiomersal or the MMR vaccine for causing autism spectrum disorder In 1998 British physician and academic Andrew Wakefield led a fraudulent litigationfunded study that suggested that the MMR vaccine may cause autism Two versions of the vaccine causation hypothesis were that autism results from brain damage caused by either the MMR vaccine itself or by mercury used as a vaccine preservative No convincing scientific evidence supports these claims They are biologically implausible and further evidence continues to refute them including the observation that the rate of autism continues to climb despite elimination of thimerosal from most routine vaccines given to children from birth to 6 years of age A 2014 metaanalysis examined ten major studies on autism and vaccines involving 125 million children worldwide it concluded that neither the vaccine preservative thimerosal mercury nor the MMR vaccine which has never contained thimerosal lead to the development of ASDs Despite this misplaced parental concern has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children Etiological hypotheses Several hypotheses have been presented that try to explain how and why autism develops by integrating known causes genetic and environmental effects and findings neurobiological and somatic Some are more comprehensive such as the Pathogenetic Triad which proposes and operationalizes three core features an autistic personality cognitive compensation neuropathological burden that interact to cause autism and the Intense World Theory which explains autism through a hyperactive neurobiology that leads to an increased perception attention memory and emotionality There are also simpler hypotheses that explain only individual parts of the neurobiology or phenotype of autism such as mindblindness a decreased ability for theory of mind the weak central coherence theory or the extreme male brain and empathisingsystemising theory Evolutionary hypotheses Research exploring the evolutionary benefits of autism and associated genes has suggested that autistic people may have played a unique role in technological spheres and understanding of natural systems in the course of human development It has been suggested that autism may have arisen as a slight trade off for other traits that are seen as highly advantageous providing advantages in tool making and mechanical thinking with speculation that the condition may reveal itself to be the result of a balanced polymorphism like sickle cell anemia that is advantageous in a certain mixture of genes and disadvantageous in specific combinations In 2011 a paper in Evolutionary Psychology proposed that autistic traits including increased spatial intelligence concentration and memory could have been naturally selected to enable selfsufficient foraging in a more although not completely solitary environment This is called the Solitary Forager Hypothesis A 2016 paper examines Asperger syndrome as an alternative prosocial adaptive strategy that may have developed as a result of the emergence of collaborative morality in the context of smallscale huntergathering ie where a positive social reputation for making a contribution to group wellbeing and survival becomes more important than complex social understanding Some multidisciplinary research suggests that recent human evolution may be a driving force in the rise of a number of medical conditions including autism in recent human populations Studies in evolutionary medicine indicate that as cultural evolution outpaces biological evolution disorders linked to bodily dysfunction increase in prevalence due to lack of contact with pathogens and negative environmental conditions that once widely affected ancestral populations Because natural selection favors reproduction over health and longevity the lack of this impetus to adapt to certain harmful circumstances creates a tendency for genes in descendant populations to overexpress themselves which may cause a wide array of maladies ranging from mental disorders to autoimmune diseases Conversely noting the failure to find specific alleles that reliably cause autism or rare mutations that account for more than 5 of the heritable variation in autism established by twin and adoption studies research in evolutionary psychiatry has concluded that it is unlikely that there is selection pressure for autism when considering that like schizophrenics autistic people and their siblings tend to have fewer offspring on average than nonautistic people and instead that autism is probably better explained as a byproduct of adaptive traits caused by antagonistic pleiotropy and by genes that are retained due to a fitness landscape with an asymmetric distribution Pathophysiology Diagnosis Conditions correlated or comorbid to autism Autism is correlated or comorbid with several personality traitsdisorders Comorbidity may increase with age and may worsen the course of youth with ASDs and make intervention and treatment more difficult Distinguishing between ASDs and other diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of ASDs often overlap with symptoms of other disorders and the characteristics of ASDs make traditional diagnostic procedures difficult Correlations Research indicates that autistic people are significantly more likely to be LGBT than the general population There is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria occurs more frequently in autistic people A 2021 anonymized online survey of 16 to 90yearolds revealed that autistic males are more likely to identify as bisexual than their nonautistic peers while autistic females are more likely to identify as homosexual than nonautistic females do People on the autism spectrum are significantly more likely to be nontheistic than members of the general population Comorbidities The most common medical condition occurring in autistic people is seizure disorder or epilepsy which occurs in 1139 of autistic people The risk varies with age cognitive level and type of language disorder Tuberous sclerosis an autosomal dominant genetic condition in which nonmalignant tumors grow in the brain and on other vital organs is present in 14 of autistic people Intellectual disabilities are some of the most common comorbid disorders with ASDs As diagnosis is increasingly being given to people with higher functioning autism there is a tendency for the proportion with comorbid intellectual disability to decrease over time In a 2019 study it was estimated that approximately 3040 of people diagnosed with ASD also have intellectual disability Recent research has suggested that autistic people with intellectual disability tend to have rarer more harmful genetic mutations than those found in people solely diagnosed with autism A number of genetic syndromes causing intellectual disability may also be comorbid with ASD including fragile X Down PraderWilli Angelman Williams syndrome branchedchain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase deficiency and SYNGAP1related intellectual disability Learning disabilities are also highly comorbid in people with an ASD Approximately 2575 of people with an ASD also have some degree of a learning disability In particular attention deficit disorder which is generally more prevalent than autism ca 8 vs 1 is not directly related though it is sometimes comorbid with autism Various anxiety disorders tend to cooccur with ASDs with overall comorbidity rates of 784 They are common among children with ASD there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11 to 84 Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself or are hard to distinguish from ASDs symptoms Rates of comorbid depression in people with an ASD range from 458 The relationship between ASD and schizophrenia remains a controversial subject under continued investigation and recent metaanalyses have examined genetic environmental infectious and immune risk factors that may be shared between the two conditions Oxidative stress DNA damage and DNA repair have been postulated to play a role in the aetiopathology of both ASD and schizophrenia Deficits in ASD are often linked to behavior problems such as difficulties following directions being cooperative and doing things on other peoples terms Symptoms similar to those of ADHD can be part of an ASD diagnosis Sensory processing disorder is also comorbid with ASD with comorbidity rates of 4288 Starting in adolescence some people with Asperger syndrome 26 in one sample fall under the criteria for the similar condition schizoid personality disorder which is characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle secretiveness emotional coldness detachment and apathy Asperger syndrome was traditionally called schizoid disorder of childhood Genetic disorders about 1015 of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian singlegene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndromes Several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms Gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly cooccurring medical conditions in autistic people These are linked to greater social impairment irritability language impairments mood changes and behavior and sleep problems A 2015 review proposed that immune gastrointestinal inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction A 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain Sleep problems affect about twothirds of autistic people at some point in childhood These most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis Dysautonomia is common in ASD affecting heart rate and blood pressure and causing symptoms such as brain fog blurry vision and bowel dysfunction It can be diagnosed through a Tilt table test The frequency of ASD is 10 times higher in mast cell activation syndrome patients than in the general population This immunological condition causes cardiovascular dermatological gastrointestinal neurological and respiratory problems Management There is no treatment as such for autism and many sources advise that this is not an appropriate goal although treatment of cooccurring conditions remains an important goal There is no cure for autism nor can any of the known treatments significantly reduce brain mutations caused by autism although those who require little to no support are more likely to experience a lessening of symptoms over time Several interventions can help children with autism and no single treatment is best with treatment typically tailored to the childs needs Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy but the development of evidencebased interventions has advanced The main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence In general higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes Behavioral psychological education and skillbuilding interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently as well as other social communication and language skills Therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths Intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life may help children acquire selfcare language and job skills Although evidencebased interventions for autistic children vary in their methods many adopt a psychoeducational approach to enhancing cognitive communication and social skills while minimizing problem behaviors While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability inattention or repetitive behavior patterns Nonpharmacological interventions Intensive sustained special education or remedial education programs and behavior therapy early in life may help children acquire selfcare social and job skills Available approaches include applied behavior analysis developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy cognitive behavioral therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy Among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focus treatment on a specific area of deficit Generally when educating those with autism specific tactics may be used to effectively relay information to these people Using as much social interaction as possible is key in targeting the inhibition autistic people experience concerning persontoperson contact Additionally research has shown that employing semantic groupings which involves assigning words to typical conceptual categories can be beneficial in fostering learning There has been increasing attention to the development of evidencebased interventions for autistic young children Three theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavior analysis ABA the developmental socialpragmatic model DSP and cognitive behavioral therapy CBT Although ABA therapy has a strong evidence base particularly in regard to early intensive homebased therapy ABAs effectiveness may be limited by diagnostic severity and IQ of the person affected by ASD The Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology has published a paper deeming two early childhood interventions wellestablished individual comprehensive ABA and focused teacherimplemented ABA combined with DSP Many people including autistic adults have criticized ABA calling it unhelpful unethical and even abuse Autistic scholar Nick Walker who experienced ABA as a child has said that through ABA autistic children are abused coerced and traumatized into imitating the outward behavior of neurotypical children at the expense of their longterm psychological wellbeing SandovalNorton et al also discuss the unintended but damaging consequences such as prompt dependency psychological abuse and compliance that result in autistic people facing challenges as they transition into adulthood Some ABA advocates have responded to such critiques that instead of stopping ABA there should be movement to increase protections and ethical compliance when working with autistic children Another evidencebased intervention that has demonstrated efficacy is a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques themselves Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through athome parent implementation In October 2015 the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP proposed new evidencebased recommendations for early interventions in ASD for children under 3 These recommendations emphasize early involvement with both developmental and behavioral methods support by and for parents and caregivers and a focus on both the core and associated symptoms of ASD But a Cochrane review found no evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention EIBI is effective in reducing behavioral problems associated with autism in most autistic children though it did improve IQ and language skills The Cochrane review acknowledged that this may be due to the low quality of studies available on EIBI and therefore providers should recommend EIBI based on their clinical judgment and the familys preferences No adverse effects of EIBI treatment were found A metaanalysis in that same database indicates that due to the heterology in ASD children progress to differing early intervention modalities based on ABA ASD treatment generally focuses on behavioral and educational interventions to target its two core symptoms social communication deficits and restricted repetitive behaviors If symptoms continue after behavioral strategies have been implemented some medications can be recommended to target specific symptoms or coexisting problems such as restricted and repetitive behaviors RRBs anxiety depression hyperactivityinattention and sleep disturbance Melatonin for example can be used for sleep problems Several parentmediated behavioral therapies target social communication deficits in children with autism but their efficacy in treating RRBs is uncertain Education Educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis ABA developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy and social skills therapy Among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention EIBIa treatment procedure incorporating over 30 hours per week of the structured type of ABA that is carried out with very young childrenis low more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic ABA interventions and developmental social pragmatic models DSP One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through athome parent implementation Despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment Early intensive ABA therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children it is also wellestablished for improving the intellectual performance of that age group In 2018 a Cochrane metaanalysis database concluded that some recent research is beginning to suggest that because of the heterology of ASD there are two different ABA teaching approaches to acquiring spoken language children with higher receptive language skills respond to 25 to 20 hours per week of the naturalistic approach whereas children with lower receptive language skills require 25 hours per week of discrete trial trainingthe structured and intensive form of ABA A 2023 randomized control trial study of 164 participants showed similar findings Similarly a teacherimplemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving socialcommunication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers Pharmacological interventions Medications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails They may also be used for associated health problems such as ADHD anxiety or if the person is hurting themself or aggressive with others but their routine prescription for ASDs core features is not recommended More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics The atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are FDAapproved for treating associated aggressive and selfinjurious behaviors But their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and autistic people may respond atypically Side effects may include weight gain tiredness drooling and paradoxical aggression Some emerging data show positive effects of aripiprazole and risperidone on restricted and repetitive behaviors ie stimming eg flapping twisting complex wholebody movements but due to the small sample size and different focus of these studies and the concerns about their side effects antipsychotics are not recommended as primary treatment of RRBs SSRI antidepressants such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with comorbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD No known medication is approved for treating autisms core symptoms of social and communication impairments although animal models indicate that postnatal administration of MDMA may be effective MDMA has also been investigated alongside psychotherapy to treat social anxiety in autistic adults Alternative medicine A multitude of alternative therapies have been researched and implemented and many have resulted in harm to autistic people A 2020 systematic review on adults with autism provided evidence that mindfulnessbased interventions may decrease stress anxiety ruminating thoughts anger and aggression and improve mental health Although popularly used as an alternative treatment for autistic people as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a gluten and caseinfree diet as a standard treatment A 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism such as those with known food intolerances or allergies or with food intolerance markers The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten and caseinfree diet in children with ASD 4 in total All of them compared gluten and caseinfree diet versus normal diet with a control group 2 doubleblind randomized controlled trials 1 doubleblind crossover trial 1 singleblind trial In two of the studies whose duration was 12 and 24 months a significant improvement in ASD symptoms efficacy rate 50 was identified In the other two studies whose duration was 3 months no significant effect was observed The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet small sample size the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect In the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a glutenfree diet may improve some autistic behaviors The preference that autistic children have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this risk being greater in those on caseinfree diets as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin D however suboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders In 2005 botched chelation therapy killed a fiveyearold child with autism Chelation is not recommended for autistic people since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is CEASE therapy a pseudoscientific mixture of homeopathy supplements and vaccine detoxing Results of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulnessbased interventions for improving mental health This includes decreasing stress anxiety ruminating thoughts anger and aggression An updated Cochrane review 2022 found evidence that music therapy likely improves social interactions verbal communication and nonverbal communication skills There has been early research on hyperbaric treatments in children with autism Studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects Prevention While infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1 of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases Prognosis There is no evidence of a cure for autism The degree of symptoms can decrease occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of ASD this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not It is not known how often this outcome happens with reported rates in unselected samples ranging from 3 to 25 Although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age Acquiring language before age six having an IQ above 50 and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely in autistic people with higher support needs Among others academic Temple Grandin has advised against striving to cure autism saying that if a cure were found she would choose to stay the way she is She wrote The skills that people with autism bring to the table should be nurtured for their benefit and for the benefit of society adding If you totally get rid of autism youd have nobody to fix your computer in the future The prognosis of autism describes the developmental course gradual autism development regressive autism development differential outcomes academic performance and employment Epidemiology The World Health Organization estimates about 1 in 100 children had autism during the period from 2012 to 2021 as that was the average estimate in studies published during that period with a trend of increasing prevalence over time However the studys 1 figure may reflect an underestimate of prevalence in low and middleincome countries The number of people diagnosed has increased considerably since the 1990s which may be partly due to increased recognition of the condition While rates of ASD are consistent across cultures they vary greatly by gender with boys diagnosed far more frequently than girls 1 in 70 boys but only 1 in 315 girls at eight years of age Girls however are more likely to have associated cognitive impairment suggesting that less severe forms of ASD are likely being missed in girls and women Prevalence differences may be a result of gender differences in expression of clinical symptoms with women and girls with autism showing less atypical behaviors and therefore less likely to receive an ASD diagnosis Using DSM5 criteria 92 of the children diagnosed per DSMIV with one of the disorders which is considered part of ASD will still meet the diagnostic criteria of ASD However if both ASD and the social pragmatic communication disorder categories of DSM5 are combined the prevalence of autism is mostly unchanged from the prevalence per the DSMIV criteria The best estimate for prevalence of ASD is 07 or 1 child in 143 children Relatively mild forms of autism such as Aspergers as well as other developmental disorders are included in the DSM5 diagnostic criteria ASD rates were constant between 2014 and 2016 but twice the rate compared to the time period between 2011 and 2014 125 vs 247 A Canadian metaanalysis from 2019 confirmed these effects as the profiles of autistic people became less and less different from the profiles of the general population In the US the rates for diagnosed ASD have been steadily increasing since 2000 when records began being kept While it remains unclear whether this trend represents a true rise in incidence it likely reflects changes in ASD diagnostic criteria improved detection and increased public awareness of autism In 2012 the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 11 A 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1000 children for ASD Rates of autism are poorly understood in many low and middleincome countries which affects the accuracy of global ASD prevalence estimates but it is thought that most autistic people live in low and middleincome countries In 2020 the Centers for Disease Controls Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring ADDM Network reported that approximately 1 in 54 children in the United States 1 in 34 boys and 1 in 144 girls is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder ASD based on data collected in 2016 This estimate is a 10 increase from the 1 in 59 rate in 2014 a 105 increase from the 1 in 110 rate in 2006 and a 176 increase from the 1 in 150 rate in 2000 Diagnostic criteria for ASD have changed significantly since the 1980s for example US specialeducation autism classification was introduced in 1994 In the UK from 1998 to 2018 the autism diagnoses increased by 787 This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness particularly among women though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autisms true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward psychosocial factors and changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics It has been established that vaccination is not a risk factor for autism and is not a cause of any increase in autism prevalence rates if any change in the rate of autism exists at all Males have higher likelihood of being diagnosed with ASD than females The sex ratio averages 431 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to 21 with intellectual disability and more than 551 without Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed The risk of developing autism is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism Most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism History Society and culture An autistic culture has emerged accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements that argues autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured although a minority of autistic people might still accept a cure Worldwide events related to autism include World Autism Awareness Day Autism Sunday Autistic Pride Day Autreat and others Socialscience scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements Many autistic people have been successful in their fields Special interests are commonly found in autistic people sometimes leading to hobbies vast collections and activism Environmental activist Greta Thunberg has spoken favorably about her autism diagnosis saying that autism can be a source of life purpose as well as forming the basis of careers hobbies and friendships Neurodiversity movement Some autistic people as well as a growing number of researchers have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference rather than a disease that must be treated or cured Critics have bemoaned the entrenchment of some of these groups opinions The neurodiversity movement and the autism rights movement are social movements within the context of disability rights emphasizing the concept of neurodiversity which describes the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured The autism rights movement advocates including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors therapies that focus on coping skills rather than imitating the behaviors of those without autism and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural variation in the human genome These movements are not without detractors a common argument against neurodiversity activists is that most of them have relatively low support needs or are selfdiagnosed and do not represent the views of autistic people with higher support needs Jacquiline den Houting explores this critique determining that the voices of lowsupport needs autistics are some of the most influential within the neurodiversity movement although admittedly these voices are a minority within the advocacy community she suggests this is in part a shortcoming of the wider neurotypical community referencing nonspeaking selfadvocate Amy Sequenzias writing Pier Jaarsma and Stellan Welin make the argument that only highfunctioning autistic people should be included under the neurodiversity banner as lowfunctioning autists condition may rightfully be viewed as a disability The concept of neurodiversity is contentious in autism advocacy and research groups and has led to infighting Events Since 2011 the Autistic Self Advocacy Network has celebrated April as Autism Acceptance Month In 2021 the Autism Society of America urged organizations to retitle Autism Awareness Day as Autism Acceptance Day to focus on more fully integrating those 1 in 54 Americans living with autism into our social fabric Symbols and flags Puzzle piece In 1963 the British National Autistic Society chose a puzzle piece as its logo due to its view of autistic people as suffering from a puzzling condition The logo designed by board member Gerald Gasson consisted of a green and black puzzle piece with four knobs with a crying child at its center Other organizations and advocates adopted the puzzle piece as a symbol of autism including American organization Autism Speaks which uses a puzzle piece with one knob two holes one edge In 1999 the Autism Society designed the puzzle ribbon an awareness ribbon patterned with red yellow cyan and blue puzzle pieces as a symbol of autism awareness The puzzle symbol is controversial among autism advocates and rejected by many It has been criticized as outdated now that autism is better understood as well as implying that autistic people are mysterious or incomplete and for its association with Autism Speaks The autism rights movement and neurodiversity advocates have criticized Autism Speaks for its view of autism as a disease to be cured Rainbow infinity In 2004 neurodiversity advocates Amy and Gwen Nelson designed the rainbow infinity symbol originally as the logo for their advocacy group Aspies For Freedom Many adopted the infinity symbol as a symbol for the autism spectrum The prismatic colors are often associated with the neurodiversity movement in general In 2018 Julian Morgan wrote the article Light It Up Gold a response to the Light It Up Blue awareness campaign Autism Speaks launched in 2007 Morgan pushed to use gold to symbolize autism due its chemical symbol Au from the Latin Aurum Flags An autistic pride flag was created in 2005 by Aspies For Freedom for the first Autistic Pride Day featuring a rainbow infinity symbol on a white background As the rainbow infinity on a white background has become increasingly viewed as representative of neurodiversity in general several designs have been proposed for an autisticspecific flag In 2023 the Peoples History Museum featured a 2015 autistic pride design by Joseph Redford featuring a rainbow infinity symbol a green background for being true to ones nature and a purple background for neurodiversity Caregivers Families who care for an autistic child face added stress from a number of different causes Parents may struggle to understand the diagnosis and to find appropriate care options They often take a negative view of the diagnosis and may struggle emotionally More than half of parents over age 50 are still living with their child as about 85 of autistic people have difficulties living independently Some studies also find decreased earnings among parents who care for autistic children Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children like siblings of children with Down syndrome But they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome siblings of autistic people have a greater risk of negative wellbeing and poorer sibling relationships as adults See also Notes

    title: "Eating disorders",
    originalContent:
      "An eating disorder is a mental disorder defined by abnormal eating behaviors that adversely affect a persons physical or mental health These behaviors include eating either too much or too little Types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder where the patient keeps eating large amounts in a short period of time typically while not being hungry anorexia nervosa where the person has an intense fear of gaining weight and restricts food or overexercises to manage this fear bulimia nervosa where individuals eat a large quantity binging then try to rid themselves of the food purging pica where the patient eats nonfood items rumination syndrome where the patient regurgitates undigested or minimally digested food avoidantrestrictive food intake disorder ARFID where people have a reduced or selective food intake due to some psychological reasons and a group of other specified feeding or eating disorders Anxiety disorders depression and substance abuse are common among people with eating disorders These disorders do not include obesity People often experience comorbidity between an eating disorder and OCD It is estimated 2060 of patients with an ED have a history of OCD The causes of eating disorders are not clear although both biological and environmental factors appear to play a role Cultural idealization of thinness is believed to contribute to some eating disorders Individuals who have experienced sexual abuse are also more likely to develop eating disorders Some disorders such as pica and rumination disorder occur more often in people with intellectual disabilities Treatment can be effective for many eating disorders Treatment varies by disorder and may involve counseling dietary advice reducing excessive exercise and the reduction of efforts to eliminate food Medications may be used to help with some of the associated symptoms Hospitalization may be needed in more serious cases About 70 of people with anorexia and 50 of people with bulimia recover within five years Only 10 of people with eating disorders receive treatment and of those approximately 80 do not receive the proper care Many are sent home weeks earlier than the recommended stay and are not provided with the necessary treatment Recovery from binge eating disorder is less clear and estimated at 20 to 60 Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death When people experience comorbidity with an eating disorder and OCD certain aspects of treatment can be negatively impacted OCD can make it harder to recover from obsession over weight and shape body dissatisfaction and body checking This is in part because ED cognitions serve a similar purpose to OCD obsessions and compulsions eg safety behaviors as temporary relief from anxiety Research shows OCD does not have an impact on the BMI of patients during treatment Estimates of the prevalence of eating disorders vary widely reflecting differences in gender age and culture as well as methods used for diagnosis and measurement In the developed world anorexia affects about 04 and bulimia affects about 13 of young women in a given year Binge eating disorder affects about 16 of women and 08 of men in a given year According to one analysis the percent of women who will have anorexia at some point in their lives may be up to 4 or up to 2 for bulimia and binge eating disorders Rates of eating disorders appear to be lower in less developed countries Anorexia and bulimia occur nearly ten times more often in females than males The typical onset of eating disorders is in late childhood to early adulthood Rates of other eating disorders are not clear Classification ICD and DSM diagnoses These eating disorders are specified as mental disorders in standard medical manuals including the ICD10 and the DSM5 Anorexia nervosa AN is the restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to significantly low body weight in the context of age sex developmental trajectory and physical health It is accompanied by an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat as well as a disturbance in the way one experiences and appraises their body weight or shape There are two subtypes of AN the restricting type and the bingeeatingpurging type The restricting type describes presentations in which weight loss is attained through dieting fasting andor excessive exercise with an absence of bingepurge behaviors The bingeeatingpurging type describes presentations in which the individual with the condition has engaged in recurrent episodes of bingeeating and purging behavior such as selfinduced vomiting misuse of laxatives and diuretics Pubertal and postpubertal females with anorexia often experience amenorrhea that is the loss of menstrual periods due to the extreme weight loss these individuals face Although amenorrhea was a required criterion for a diagnosis of anorexia in the DSMIV it was dropped in the DSM5 due to its exclusive nature as male postmenopause women or individuals who do not menstruate for other reasons would fail to meet this criterion Females with bulimia may also experience amenorrhea although the cause is not clear Bulimia nervosa BN is characterized by recurrent binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as purging selfinduced vomiting eating to the point of vomiting excessive use of laxativesdiuretics or excessive exercise Fasting may also be used as a method of purging following a binge However unlike anorexia nervosa body weight is maintained at or above a minimally normal level Severity of BN is determined by the number of episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week Binge eating disorder BED is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors that are present in BN and AN bingeeatingpurging subtype Binge eating episodes are associated with eating much more rapidly than normal eating until feeling uncomfortably full eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating andor feeling disgusted with oneself depressed or very guilty after eating For a BED diagnosis to be given marked distress regarding binge eating must be present and the binge eating must occur an average of once a week for 3 months Severity of BED is determined by the number of binge eating episodes per week Pica is the persistent eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances in a way that is not developmentally appropriate or culturally supported Although substances consumed vary with age and availability paper soap hair chalk paint and clay are among the most commonly consumed in those with a pica diagnosis There are multiple causes for the onset of pica including irondeficiency anemia malnutrition and pregnancy and pica often occurs in tandem with other mental health disorders associated with impaired function such as intellectual disability autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia In order for a diagnosis of pica to be warranted behaviors must last for at least one month Rumination disorder encompasses the repeated regurgitation of food which may be rechewed reswallowed or spit out For this diagnosis to be warranted behaviors must persist for at least one month and regurgitation of food cannot be attributed to another medical condition Additionally rumination disorder is distinct from AN BN BED and ARFID and thus cannot occur during the course of one of these illnesses Avoidantrestrictive food intake disorder ARFID is a feeding or eating disturbance such as a lack of interest in eating food avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food or concern about aversive consequences of eating that prevents one from meeting nutritional energy needs It is frequently associated with weight loss nutritional deficiency or failure to meet growth trajectories Notably ARFID is distinguishable from AN and BN in that there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in which ones body weight or shape is experienced The disorder is not better explained by lack of available food cultural practices a concurrent medical condition or another mental disorder Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder OSFED is an eating or feeding disorder that does not meet full DSM5 criteria for AN BN or BED Examples of otherwisespecified eating disorders include individuals with atypical anorexia nervosa who meet all criteria for AN except being underweight despite substantial weight loss atypical bulimia nervosa who meet all criteria for BN except that bulimic behaviors are less frequent or have not been ongoing for long enough purging disorder and night eating syndrome Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder USFED describes feeding or eating disturbances that cause marked distress and impairment in important areas of functioning but that do not meet the full criteria for any of the other diagnoses The specific reason the presentation does not meet criteria for a specified disorder is not given For example an USFED diagnosis may be given when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis such as in an emergency room setting Other Compulsive overeating which may include habitual grazing of food or episodes of binge eating without feelings of guilt Diabulimia which is characterized by the deliberate manipulation of insulin levels by diabetics in an effort to control their weight Drunkorexia which is commonly characterized by purposely restricting food intake in order to reserve food calories for alcoholic calories exercising excessively in order to burn calories from drinking and overdrinking alcohol in order to purge previously consumed food Food maintenance which is characterized by a set of aberrant eating behaviors of children in foster care Night eating syndrome which is characterized by nocturnal hyperphagia consumption of 25 or more of the total daily calories after the evening meal with nocturnal ingestions insomnia loss of morning appetite and depression Nocturnal sleeprelated eating disorder which is a parasomnia characterized by eating habitually outofcontrol while in a state of NREM sleep with no memory of this the next morning Gourmand syndrome a rare condition occurring after damage to the frontal lobe Individuals develop an obsessive focus on fine foods Orthorexia nervosa a term used by Steven Bratman to describe an obsession with a pure diet in which a person develops an obsession with avoiding unhealthy foods to the point where it interferes with the persons life KlverBucy syndrome caused by bilateral lesions of the medial temporal lobe includes compulsive eating hypersexuality hyperorality visual agnosia and docility PraderWilli syndrome a genetic disorder associated with insatiable appetite and morbid obesity Pregorexia which is characterized by extreme dieting and overexercising in order to control pregnancy weight gain Prenatal undernutrition is associated with low birth weight coronary heart disease type 2 diabetes stroke hypertension cardiovascular disease risk and depression Muscle dysmorphia is characterized by appearance preoccupation that ones own body is too small too skinny insufficiently muscular or insufficiently lean Muscle dysmorphia affects mostly males Purging disorder Recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or shape in the absence of binge eating It is more properly a disorder of elimination rather than eating disorder Symptoms and longterm effects Symptoms and complications vary according to the nature and severity of the eating disorder Associated physical symptoms of eating disorders include weakness fatigue sensitivity to cold reduced beard growth in men reduction in waking erections reduced libido weight loss and growth failure Frequent vomiting which may cause acid reflux or entry of acidic gastric material into the laryngoesophageal tract can lead to unexplained hoarseness As such individuals who induce vomiting as part of their eating disorder such as those with anorexia nervosa binge eatingpurging type or those with purgingtype bulimia nervosa are at risk for acid reflux Polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder to affect women Though often associated with obesity it can occur in normal weight individuals PCOS has been associated with binge eating and bulimic behavior Other possible manifestations are dry lips burning tongue parotid gland swelling and temporomandibular disorders Psychopathology The psychopathology of eating disorders centers around body image disturbance such as concerns with weight and shape selfworth being too dependent on weight and shape fear of gaining weight even when underweight denial of how severe the symptoms are and a distortion in the way the body is experienced The main psychopathological features of anorexia were outlined in 1982 as problems in body perception emotion processing and interpersonal relationships Women with eating disorders have greater body dissatisfaction This impairment of body perception involves vision proprioception interoception and tactile perception There is an alteration in integration of signals in which body parts are experienced as dissociated from the body as a whole Bruch once theorized that difficult early relationships were related to the cause of anorexia and how primary caregivers can contribute to the onset of the illness A prominent feature of bulimia is dissatisfaction with body shape However dissatisfaction with body shape is not of diagnostic significance as it is sometimes present in individuals with no eating disorder This highly labile feature can fluctuate depending on changes in shape and weight the degree of control over eating and mood In contrast a necessary diagnostic feature for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa is having overvalued ideas about shape and weight are relatively stable and partially related to the patients low selfesteem Proana subculture Proana refers to the promotion of behaviors related to the eating disorder anorexia nervosa Several websites promote eating disorders and can provide a means for individuals to communicate in order to maintain eating disorders Members of these websites typically feel that their eating disorder is the only aspect of a chaotic life that they can control These websites are often interactive and have discussion boards where individuals can share strategies ideas and experiences such as diet and exercise plans that achieve extremely low weights A study comparing the personal webblogs that were proeating disorder with those focused on recovery found that the proeating disorder blogs contained language reflecting lower cognitive processing used a more closedminded writing style contained less emotional expression and fewer social references and focused more on eatingrelated contents than did the recovery blogs Causes There is no single cause of eating disorders Many people with eating disorders also have body image disturbance and a comorbid body dysmorphic disorder BDD leading them to an altered perception of their body Studies have found that a high proportion of individuals diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder also had some type of eating disorder with 15 of individuals having either anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa This link between body dysmorphic disorder and anorexia stems from the fact that both BDD and anorexia nervosa are characterized by a preoccupation with physical appearance and a distortion of body image There are also many other possibilities such as environmental social and interpersonal issues that could promote and sustain these illnesses Also the media are oftentimes blamed for the rise in the incidence of eating disorders due to the fact that media images of idealized slim physical shape of people such as models and celebrities motivate or even force people to attempt to achieve slimness themselves The media are accused of distorting reality in the sense that people portrayed in the media are either naturally thin and thus unrepresentative of normality or unnaturally thin by forcing their bodies to look like the ideal image by putting excessive pressure on themselves to look a certain way While past findings have described eating disorders as primarily psychological environmental and sociocultural further studies have uncovered evidence that there is a genetic component Genetics Numerous studies show a genetic predisposition toward eating disorders Twin studies have found a slight instances of genetic variance when considering the different criterion of both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa as endophenotypes contributing to the disorders as a whole A genetic link has been found on chromosome 1 in multiple family members of an individual with anorexia nervosa An individual who is a first degree relative of someone who has had or currently has an eating disorder is seven to twelve times more likely to have an eating disorder themselves Twin studies also show that at least a portion of the vulnerability to develop eating disorders can be inherited and there is evidence to show that there is a genetic locus that shows susceptibility for developing anorexia nervosa About 50 of eating disorder cases are attributable to genetics Other cases are due to external reasons or developmental problems There are also other neurobiological factors at play tied to emotional reactivity and impulsivity that could lead to binging and purging behaviors Epigenetics mechanisms are means by which environmental effects alter gene expression via methods such as DNA methylation these are independent of and do not alter the underlying DNA sequence They are heritable but also may occur throughout the lifespan and are potentially reversible Dysregulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission due to epigenetic mechanisms has been implicated in various eating disorders Other candidate genes for epigenetic studies in eating disorders include leptin proopiomelanocortin POMC and brainderived neurotrophic factor BDNF There has found to be a genetic correlation between anorexia nervosa and OCD suggesting a strong etiology First and second relatives of probands with OCD have a greater chance of developing anorexia nervosa as genetic relatedness increases Psychological Eating disorders are classified as Axis I disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders DSMIV published by the American Psychiatric Association There are various other psychological issues that may factor into eating disorders some fulfill the criteria for a separate Axis I diagnosis or a personality disorder which is coded Axis II and thus are considered comorbid to the diagnosed eating disorder Axis II disorders are subtyped into 3 clusters A B and C The causality between personality disorders and eating disorders has yet to be fully established Some people have a previous disorder which may increase their vulnerability to developing an eating disorder Some develop them afterwards The severity and type of eating disorder symptoms have been shown to affect comorbidity There has been controversy over various editions of the DSM diagnostic criteria including the latest edition DSMV published in 2013 Cognitive attentional bias Attentional bias may have an effect on eating disorders Attentional bias is the preferential attention toward certain types of information in the environment while simultaneously ignoring others Individuals with eating disorders can be thought to have schemas knowledge structures which are dysfunctional as they may bias judgement thought behaviour in a manner that is selfdestructive or maladaptive They may have developed a disordered schema which focuses on body size and eating Thus this information is given the highest level of importance and overvalued among other cognitive structures Researchers have found that people who have eating disorders tend to pay more attention to stimuli related to food For people struggling to recover from an eating disorder or addiction this tendency to pay attention to certain signals while discounting others can make recovery that much more difficult Studies have utilized the Stroop task to assess the probable effect of attentional bias on eating disorders This may involve separating food and eating words from body shape and weight words Such studies have found that anorexic subjects were slower to colour name food related words than control subjects Other studies have noted that individuals with eating disorders have significant attentional biases associated with eating and weight stimuli Personality traits There are various childhood personality traits associated with the development of eating disorders such as perfectionism and neuroticism These personality traits are found to link eating disorders and OCD During adolescence these traits may become intensified due to a variety of physiological and cultural influences such as the hormonal changes associated with puberty stress related to the approaching demands of maturity and sociocultural influences and perceived expectations especially in areas that concern body image Eating disorders have been associated with a fragile sense of self and with disordered mentalization Many personality traits have a genetic component and are highly heritable Maladaptive levels of certain traits may be acquired as a result of anoxic or traumatic brain injury neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons disease neurotoxicity such as lead exposure bacterial infection such as Lyme disease or parasitic infection such as Toxoplasma gondii as well as hormonal influences While studies are still continuing via the use of various imaging techniques such as fMRI these traits have been shown to originate in various regions of the brain such as the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex Disorders in the prefrontal cortex and the executive functioning system have been shown to affect eating behavior Celiac disease People with gastrointestinal disorders may be more risk of developing disordered eating practices than the general population principally restrictive eating disturbances An association of anorexia nervosa with celiac disease has been found The role that gastrointestinal symptoms play in the development of eating disorders seems rather complex Some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis may create a food aversion in these persons causing alterations to their eating patterns Other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk It has been documented that some people with celiac disease irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease who are not conscious about the importance of strictly following their diet choose to consume their trigger foods to promote weight loss On the other hand individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around cross contamination of their foods Some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom such as decreased appetite abdominal pain bloating distension vomiting diarrhea or constipation weight loss or growth failure and also routinely ask celiac patients about weight or body shape concerns dieting or vomiting for weight control to evaluate the possible presence of eating disorders specially in women Environmental influences Child maltreatment Child abuse which encompasses physical psychological and sexual abuse as well as neglect has been shown to approximately triple the risk of an eating disorder Sexual abuse appears to double the risk of bulimia however the association is less clear for anorexia The risk for individuals developing eating disorders increases if the individual grew up in an invalidating environment where displays of emotions were often punished Abuse that has also occurred in childhood produces intolerable difficult emotions that cannot be expressed in a healthy manner Eating disorders come in as an escape coping mechanism as a means to control and avoid overwhelming negative emotions and feelings Those who report physical or sexual maltreatment as a child are at an increased risk of developing an eating disorder Social isolation Social isolation has been shown to have a deleterious effect on an individuals physical and emotional wellbeing Those that are socially isolated have a higher mortality rate in general as compared to individuals that have established social relationships This effect on mortality is markedly increased in those with preexisting medical or psychiatric conditions and has been especially noted in cases of coronary heart disease The magnitude of risk associated with social isolation is comparable with that of cigarette smoking and other major biomedical and psychosocial risk factors Brummett et al Social isolation can be inherently stressful depressing and anxietyprovoking In an attempt to ameliorate these distressful feelings an individual may engage in emotional eating in which food serves as a source of comfort The loneliness of social isolation and the inherent stressors thus associated have been implicated as triggering factors in binge eating as well Waller Kennerley and Ohanian 2007 argued that both bingeingvomiting and restriction are emotion suppression strategies but they are just utilized at different times For example restriction is used to preempt any emotion activation while bingeingvomiting is used after an emotion has been activated Parental influence Parental influence has been shown to be an intrinsic component in the development of eating behaviors of children This influence is manifested and shaped by a variety of diverse factors such as familial genetic predisposition dietary choices as dictated by cultural or ethnic preferences the parents own body shape how they talk about their own body and eating patterns the degree of involvement and expectations of their childrens eating behavior as well as the interpersonal relationship of parent and child It is also influenced by the general psychosocial climate of the home and whether a nurturing stable environment is present It has been shown that maladaptive parental behavior has an important role in the development of eating disorders As to the more subtle aspects of parental influence it has been shown that eating patterns are established in early childhood and that children should be allowed to decide when their appetite is satisfied as early as the age of two A direct link has been shown between obesity and parental pressure to eat more Coercive tactics in regard to diet have not been proven to be efficacious in controlling a childs eating behavior Affection and attention have been shown to affect the degree of a childs finickiness and their acceptance of a more varied diet Adams and Crane 1980 have shown that parents are influenced by stereotypes that influence their perception of their childs body The conveyance of these negative stereotypes also affects the childs own body image and satisfaction Hilde Bruch a pioneer in the field of studying eating disorders asserts that anorexia nervosa often occurs in girls who are high achievers obedient and always trying to please their parents Their parents have a tendency to be overcontrolling and fail to encourage the expression of emotions inhibiting daughters from accepting their own feelings and desires Adolescent females in these overbearing families lack the ability to be independent from their families yet realize the need to often resulting in rebellion Controlling their food intake may make them feel better as it provides them with a sense of control Negative parental bodytalk meaning when a parent comments on their own weight shape or size is strongly correlated with disordered eating in their children Children whose parents engage in selftalk about their weight frequently are three times as likely to practice extreme weight control behaviors such as disordered eating than children who do not overhear negative parental bodytalk Additionally negative bodytalk from mothers is explicitly correlated with disordered eating in adolescent girls Peer pressure In various studies such as one conducted by The McKnight Investigators peer pressure was shown to be a significant contributor to body image concerns and attitudes toward eating among subjects in their teens and early twenties Eleanor Mackey and coauthor Annette M La Greca of the University of Miami studied 236 teen girls from public high schools in southeast Florida Teen girls concerns about their own weight about how they appear to others and their perceptions that their peers want them to be thin are significantly related to weightcontrol behavior says psychologist Eleanor Mackey of the Childrens National Medical Center in Washington and lead author of the study Those are really important According to one study 40 of 9 and 10yearold girls are already trying to lose weight Such dieting is reported to be influenced by peer behavior with many of those individuals on a diet reporting that their friends also were dieting The number of friends dieting and the number of friends who pressured them to diet also played a significant role in their own choices Elite athletes have a significantly higher rate in eating disorders Female athletes in sports such as gymnastics ballet diving etc are found to be at the highest risk among all athletes Women are more likely than men to acquire an eating disorder between the ages of 13 and 25 About 015 of those with bulimia and anorexia are men Other psychological problems that could possibly create an eating disorder such as Anorexia Nervosa are depression and low selfesteem Depression is a state of mind where emotions are unstable causing a persons eating habits to change due to sadness and no interest of doing anything According to PSYCOM Studies show that a high percentage of people with an eating disorder will experience depression Depression is a state of mind where people seem to refuge without being able to get out of it A big factor of this can affect people with their eating and this can mostly affect teenagers Teenagers are big candidates for Anorexia for the reason that during the teenage years many things start changing and they start to think certain ways According to Life Works an article about eating disorders People of any age can be affected by pressure from their peers the media and even their families but it is worse when youre a teenager at school Teenagers can develop eating disorder such as Anorexia due to peer pressure which can lead to Depression Many teens start off this journey by feeling pressure for wanting to look a certain way of feeling pressure for being different This brings them to finding the result in eating less and soon leading to Anorexia which can bring big harms to the physical state Cultural pressure Western perspective There is a cultural emphasis on thinness which is especially pervasive in western society A childs perception of external pressure to achieve the ideal body that is represented by the media predicts the childs body image dissatisfaction body dysmorphic disorder and an eating disorder The cultural pressure on men and women to be perfect is an important predisposing factor for the development of eating disorders Further when women of all races base their evaluation of their self upon what is considered the culturally ideal body the incidence of eating disorders increases Socioeconomic status SES has been viewed as a risk factor for eating disorders presuming that possessing more resources allows for an individual to actively choose to diet and reduce body weight Some studies have also shown a relationship between increasing body dissatisfaction with increasing SES However once high socioeconomic status has been achieved this relationship weakens and in some cases no longer exists The media plays a major role in the way in which people view themselves Countless magazine ads and commercials depict thin celebrities Society has taught people that being accepted by others is necessary at all costs This has led to the belief that in order to fit in one must look a certain way Televised beauty competitions such as the Miss America Competition contribute to the idea of what it means to be beautiful because competitors are evaluated on the basis of their opinion In addition to socioeconomic status being considered a cultural risk factor so is the world of sports Athletes and eating disorders tend to go hand in hand especially the sports where weight is a competitive factor Gymnastics horse back riding wrestling body building and dancing are just a few that fall into this category of weight dependent sports Eating disorders among individuals that participate in competitive activities especially women often lead to having physical and biological changes related to their weight that often mimic prepubescent stages Oftentimes as womens bodies change they lose their competitive edge which leads them to taking extreme measures to maintain their younger body shape Men often struggle with binge eating followed by excessive exercise while focusing on building muscle rather than losing fat but this goal of gaining muscle is just as much an eating disorder as obsessing over thinness The following statistics taken from Susan NolenHoeksemas book abnormal psychology show the estimated percentage of athletes that struggle with eating disorders based on the category of sport Aesthetic sports dance figure skating gymnastics 35 Weight dependent sports judo wrestling 29 Endurance sports cycling swimming running 20 Technical sports golf high jumping 14 Ball game sports volleyball soccer 12 Although most of these athletes develop eating disorders to keep their competitive edge others use exercise as a way to maintain their weight and figure This is just as serious as regulating food intake for competition Even though there is mixed evidence showing at what point athletes are challenged with eating disorders studies show that regardless of competition level all athletes are at higher risk for developing eating disorders that nonathletes especially those that participate in sports where thinness is a factor Pressure from society is also seen within the homosexual community Gay men are at greater risk of eating disorder symptoms than heterosexual men Within the gay culture muscularity gives the advantages of both social and sexual desirability and also power These pressures and ideas that another homosexual male may desire a mate who is thinner or muscular can possibly lead to eating disorders The higher eating disorder symptom score reported the more concern about how others perceive them and the more frequent and excessive exercise sessions occur High levels of body dissatisfaction are also linked to external motivation to working out and old age however having a thin and muscular body occurs within younger homosexual males than older Most of the crosscultural studies use definitions from the DSMIVTR which has been criticized as reflecting a Western cultural bias Thus assessments and questionnaires may not be constructed to detect some of the cultural differences associated with different disorders Also when looking at individuals in areas potentially influenced by Western culture few studies have attempted to measure how much an individual has adopted the mainstream culture or retained the traditional cultural values of the area Lastly the majority of the crosscultural studies on eating disorders and body image disturbances occurred in Western nations and not in the countries or regions being examined While there are many influences to how an individual processes their body image the media does play a major role Along with the media parental influence peer influence and selfefficacy beliefs also play a large role in an individuals view of themselves The way the media presents images can have a lasting effect on an individuals perception of their body image Eating disorders are a worldwide issue and while women are more likely to be affected by an eating disorder it still affects both genders Schwitzer 2012 The media influences eating disorders whether shown in a positive or negative light it then has a responsibility to use caution when promoting images that projects an ideal that many turn to eating disorders to attain To try to address unhealthy body image in the fashion world in 2015 France passed a law requiring models to be declared healthy by a doctor to participate in fashion shows It also requires retouched images to be marked as such in magazines There is a relationship between thin ideal social media content and body dissatisfaction and eating disorders among young adult women especially in the Western hemisphere New research points to an internalization of distorted images online as well as negative comparisons among young adult women Most studies have been based in the US the UK and Australia these are places where the thin ideal is strong among women as well as the strive for the perfect body In addition to mere media exposure there is an online proeating disorder community Through personal blogs and Twitter this community promotes eating disorders as a lifestyle and continuously posts pictures of emaciated bodies and tips on how to stay thin The hashtag proana proanorexia is a product of this community as well as images promoting weight loss tagged with the term thinspiration According to social comparison theory young women have a tendency to compare their appearance to others which can result in a negative view of their own bodies and altering of eating behaviors that in turn can develop disordered eating behaviors When body parts are isolated and displayed in the media as objects to be looked at it is called objectification and women are affected most by this phenomenon Objectification increases selfobjectification where women judge their own body parts as a mean of praise and pleasure for others There is a significant link between selfobjectification body dissatisfaction and disordered eating as the beauty ideal is altered through social media Although eating disorders are typically under diagnosed in people of color they still experience eating disorders in great numbers It is thought that the stress that those of color face in the United States from being multiply marginalized may contribute to their rates of eating disorders Eating disorders for these women may be a response to environmental stressors such as racism abuse and poverty African perspective In the majority of many African communities thinness is generally not seen as an ideal body type and most pressure to attain a slim figure may stem from influence or exposure to Western culture and ideology Traditional African cultural ideals are reflected in the practice of some health professionals in Ghana pharmacists sell appetite stimulants to women who desire to as Ghanaians stated grow fat Girls are told that if they wish to find a partner and birth children they must gain weight On the contrary there are certain taboos surrounding a slim body image specifically in West Africa Lack of body fat is linked to poverty and HIVAIDS However the emergence of Western and European influence specifically with the introduction of such fashion and modelling shows and competitions is changing certain views among body acceptance and the prevalence of eating disorders has consequently increased This acculturation is also related to how South Africa is concurrently undergoing rapid intense urbanization Such modern development is leading to cultural changes and professionals cite rates of eating disorders in this region will increase with urbanization specifically with changes in identity body image and cultural issues Further exposure to Western values through private Caucasian schools or caretakers is another possible factor related to acculturation which may be associated with the onset of eating disorders Other factors which are cited to be related to the increasing prevalence of eating disorders in African communities can be related to sexual conflicts such as psychosexual guilt first sexual intercourse and pregnancy Traumatic events which are related to both family ie parental separation and eating related issues are also cited as possible effectors Religious fasting particularly around times of stress and feelings of selfcontrol are also cited as determinants in the onset of eating disorders Asian perspective The West plays a role in Asias economic development via foreign investments advanced technologies joining financial markets and the arrival of American and European companies in Asia especially through outsourcing manufacturing operations This exposure to Western culture especially the media imparts Western body ideals to Asian society termed Westernization In part Westernization fosters eating disorders among Asian populations However there are also countryspecific influences on the occurrence of eating disorders in Asia China In China as well as other Asian countries Westernization migration from rural to urban areas aftereffects of sociocultural events and disruptions of social and emotional support are implicated in the emergence of eating disorders In particular risk factors for eating disorders include higher socioeconomic status preference for a thin body ideal history of child abuse high anxiety levels hostile parental relationships jealousy towards media idols and aboveaverage scores on the body dissatisfaction and interoceptive awareness sections of the Eating Disorder Inventory Similarly to the West researchers have identified the media as a primary source of pressures relating to physical appearance which may even predict body change behaviors in males and females Fiji While colonised by the British in 1874 Fiji kept a large degree of linguistic and cultural diversity which characterised the ethnic Fijian population Though gaining independence in 1970 Fiji has rejected Western capitalist values which challenged its mutual trusts bonds kinships and identity as a nation Similar to studies conducted on Polynesian groups ethnic Fijian traditional aesthetic ideals reflected a preference for a robust body shape thus the prevailing pressure to be slim thought to be associated with diet and disordered eating in many Western societies was absent in traditional Fiji Additionally traditional Fijian values would encourage a robust appetite and a widespread vigilance for and social response to weight loss Individual efforts to reshape the body by dieting or exercise thus traditionally was discouraged However studies conducted in 1995 and 1998 both demonstrated a link between the introduction of television in the country and the emergence of eating disorders in young adolescent ethnic Fijian girls Through the quantitative data collected in these studies there was found to be a significant increase in the prevalence of two key indicators of disordered eating selfinduced vomiting and high Eating Attitudes Test 26 These results were recorded following prolonged television exposure in the community and an associated increase in the percentage of households owning television sets Additionally qualitative data linked changing attitudes about dieting weight loss and aesthetic ideas in the peer environment to Western media images The impact of television was especially profound given the longstanding social and cultural traditions that had previously rejected the notions of dieting purging and body dissatisfaction in Fiji Additional studies in 2011 found that social network media exposure independent of direct media and other cultural exposures was also associated with eating pathology Hong Kong From the early tomid 1990s a variant form of anorexia nervosa was identified in Hong Kong This variant form did not share features of anorexia in the West notably fatphobia and distorted body image Patients attributed their restrictive food intake to somatic complaints such as epigastric bloating abdominal or stomach pain or a lack of hunger or appetite Compared to Western patients individuals with this variant anorexia demonstrated bulimic symptoms less frequently and tended to have lower premorbid body mass index This form disapproves the assumption that a fear of fatness or weight gain is the defining characteristic of individuals with anorexia nervosa India In the past the available evidence did not suggest that unhealthy weight loss methods and eating disordered behaviors are common in India as proven by stagnant rates of clinically diagnosed eating disorders However it appears that rates of eating disorders in urban areas of India are increasing based on surveys from psychiatrists who were asked whether they perceived eating disorders to be a serious clinical issue in India One notable Indian psychiatrist and eating disorder specialist Dr Udipi Gauthamadas is on record saying Disturbed eating attitudes and behaviours affect about 25 to 40 percent of adolescent girls and around 20 percent of adolescent boys While on one hand there is increasing recognition of eating disorders in the country there is also a persisting belief that this illness is alien to India This prevents many sufferers from seeking professional help 235 of respondents believed that rates of eating disorders were rising in Bangalore 265 claimed that rates were stagnant and 42 the largest percentage expressed uncertainty It has been suggested that urbanization and socioeconomic status are associated with increased risk for body weight dissatisfaction However due to the physical size of and diversity within India trends may vary throughout the country American perspective Black and African American Historically identifying as African American has been considered a protective factor for body dissatisfaction Those identifying as African American have been found to have a greater acceptance of larger body image ideals and less internalization of the thin ideal and African American women have reported the lowest levels of body dissatisfaction among the five major racialethnic groups in the US However recent research contradicts these findings indicating that African American women may exhibit levels of body dissatisfaction comparable to other racialethnic minority groups In this way just because those who identify as African American may not internalize the thin ideal as strongly as other racial and ethnic groups it does not mean that they do not hold other appearance ideals that may promote body shape concerns Similarly recent research shows that African Americans exhibit rates of disordered eating that are similar to or even higher than their white counterparts American Indian and Alaska Native American Indian and Alaska Native women are more likely than white women to both experience a fear of losing control over their eating and to abuse laxatives and diuretics for weight control purposes They have comparable rates of binge eating and other disordered weight control behaviors in comparison to other racial groups Latinos Disproportionately high rates of disordered eating and body dissatisfaction have been found in Hispanics in comparison to other racial and ethnic groups Studies have found significantly more laxative use in those identifying as Hispanic in comparison to nonHispanic white counterparts Specifically those identifying as Hispanic may be at heightened risk of engaging in binge eating and bingeingpurging behaviors Food insecurity Food insecurity is defined as inadequate access to sufficient food both in terms of quantity and quality in direct contrast to food security which is conceptualized as having access to sufficient safe and nutritious food to meet dietary needs and preferences Notably levels of food security exist on a continuum from reliable access to food to disrupted access to food Multiple studies have found food insecurity to be associated with eating pathology A study conducted on individuals visiting a food bank in Texas found higher food insecurity to be correlated with higher levels of binge eating overall eating disorder pathology dietary restraint compensatory behaviors and weight selfstigma Findings of a replication study with a larger more diverse sample mirrored these results and a study looking at the relationship between food insecurity and bulimia nervosa similarly found greater food insecurity to be associated with elevated levels of eating pathology Trauma One study has found that bingeeating disorder may stem from trauma with some female patients engaging in these disorders to numb pain experienced through sexual trauma There are various forms of trauma that individuals may have experienced leading them to cope through an eating disorder When in pain individuals may attempt to exert control over this aspect of their lives perceiving it as their only means of managing their life The brain is a very complex organ that tries its best to help us navigate through the hardships of life Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Sexual orientation gender identity and gender norms influence people with eating disorders Some eating disorder patients have implied that enforced heterosexuality and heterosexism led many to engage in their condition to align with norms associated with their gender identity Families may restrict womens food intake to keep them thin thus increasing their ability to attain a male romantic partner Nonheterosexual male adolescents are consistently at higher risk of developing disordered eating than their heterosexual peers for various body image concerns including worries about weight shape muscle tone and definition Eating disorders in trans and nonbinary adolescents is complicated in that some eating disorder symptoms may affirm gender identity in transitioning patients complicating treatment For example loss of menstruation in birthassigned females or a slender frame in birthassigned males may align with their gender identity during transition Mechanisms Biochemical Eating behavior is a complex process controlled by the neuroendocrine system of which the Hypothalamuspituitaryadrenalaxis HPA axis is a major component Dysregulation of the HPA axis has been associated with eating disorders such as irregularities in the manufacture amount or transmission of certain neurotransmitters hormones or neuropeptides and amino acids such as homocysteine elevated levels of which are found in AN and BN as well as depression Serotonin a neurotransmitter involved in depression also has an inhibitory effect on eating behavior Norepinephrine is both a neurotransmitter and a hormone abnormalities in either capacity may affect eating behavior Dopamine which in addition to being a precursor of norepinephrine and epinephrine is also a neurotransmitter which regulates the rewarding property of food Neuropeptide Y also known as NPY is a hormone that encourages eating and decreases metabolic rate Blood levels of NPY are elevated in patients with anorexia nervosa and studies have shown that injection of this hormone into the brain of rats with restricted food intake increases their time spent running on a wheel Normally the hormone stimulates eating in healthy patients but under conditions of starvation it increases their activity rate probably to increase the chance of finding food The increased levels of NPY in the blood of patients with eating disorders can in some ways explain the instances of extreme overexercising found in most anorexia nervosa patients Leptin and ghrelin leptin is a hormone produced primarily by the fat cells in the body it has an inhibitory effect on appetite by inducing a feeling of satiety Ghrelin is an appetite inducing hormone produced in the stomach and the upper portion of the small intestine Circulating levels of both hormones are an important factor in weight control While often associated with obesity both hormones and their respective effects have been implicated in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa Leptin can also be used to distinguish between constitutional thinness found in a healthy person with a low BMI and an individual with anorexia nervosa Gut bacteria and immune system studies have shown that a majority of patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa have elevated levels of autoantibodies that affect hormones and neuropeptides that regulate appetite control and the stress response There may be a direct correlation between autoantibody levels and associated psychological traits Later study revealed that autoantibodies reactive with alphaMSH are in fact generated against ClpB a protein produced by certain gut bacteria eg Escherichia coli ClpB protein was identified as a conformational antigenmimetic of alphaMSH In patients with eating disorders plasma levels of antiClpB IgG and IgM correalated with patients psychological traits Infection PANDAS is an abbreviation for the controversial Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections hypothesis Children with PANDAS are postulated to have obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD andor tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome and in whom symptoms worsen following infections such as strep throat NIMH PANDAS and the broader PANS are hypothesized to be a precipitating factor in the development of anorexia nervosa in some cases PANDAS AN Lesions studies have shown that lesions to the right frontal lobe or temporal lobe can cause the pathological symptoms of an eating disorder Tumors tumors in various regions of the brain have been implicated in the development of abnormal eating patterns Brain calcification a study highlights a case in which prior calcification of the right thalumus may have contributed to development of anorexia nervosa somatosensory homunculus is the representation of the body located in the somatosensory cortex first described by renowned neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield The illustration was originally termed Penfields Homunculus homunculus meaning little man In normal development this representation should adapt as the body goes through its pubertal growth spurt However in AN it is hypothesized that there is a lack of plasticity in this area which may result in impairments of sensory processing and distortion of body image Bryan Lask also proposed by VS Ramachandran Obstetric complications There have been studies done which show maternal smoking obstetric and perinatal complications such as maternal anemia very preterm birth less than 32 weeks being born small for gestational age neonatal cardiac problems preeclampsia placental infarction and sustaining a cephalhematoma at birth increase the risk factor for developing either anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa Some of this developmental risk as in the case of placental infarction maternal anemia and cardiac problems may cause intrauterine hypoxia umbilical cord occlusion or cord prolapse may cause ischemia resulting in cerebral injury the prefrontal cortex in the fetus and neonate is highly susceptible to damage as a result of oxygen deprivation which has been shown to contribute to executive dysfunction ADHD and may affect personality traits associated with both eating disorders and comorbid disorders such as impulsivity mental rigidity and obsessionality The problem of perinatal brain injury in terms of the costs to society and to the affected individuals and their families is extraordinary Yafeng Dong PhD Symptom of starvation Evidence suggests that the symptoms of eating disorders are actually symptoms of the starvation itself not of a mental disorder In a study involving thirtysix healthy young men that were subjected to semistarvation the men soon began displaying symptoms commonly found in patients with eating disorders In this study the healthy men ate approximately half of what they had become accustomed to eating and soon began developing symptoms and thought patterns preoccupation with food and eating ritualistic eating impaired cognitive ability other physiological changes such as decreased body temperature that are characteristic symptoms of anorexia nervosa The men used in the study also developed hoarding and obsessive collecting behaviors even though they had no use for the items which revealed a possible connection between eating disorders and obsessivecompulsive disorder Diagnosis According to Pritts and Susman The medical history is the most powerful tool for diagnosing eating disorders There are many medical disorders that mimic eating disorders and comorbid psychiatric disorders Early detection and intervention can assure a better recovery and can improve a lot the quality of life of these patients In the past 30 years eating disorders have become increasingly conspicuous and it is uncertain whether the changes in presentation reflect a true increase Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are the most clearly defined subgroups of a wider range of eating disorders Many patients present with subthreshold expressions of the two main diagnoses others with different patterns and symptoms As eating disorders especially anorexia nervosa are thought of as being associated with young white females diagnosis of eating disorders in other races happens more rarely In one study when clinicians were presented with identical case studies demonstrating disordered eating symptoms in Black Hispanic and white women 44 noted the white womans behavior as problematic 41 identified the Hispanic womans behavior as problematic and only 17 of the clinicians noted the Black womans behavior as problematic Gordon Brattole Wingate Joiner 2006 Medical The diagnostic workup typically includes complete medical and psychosocial history and follows a rational and formulaic approach to the diagnosis Neuroimaging using fMRI MRI PET and SPECT scans have been used to detect cases in which a lesion tumor or other organic condition has been either the sole causative or contributory factor in an eating disorder Right frontal intracerebral lesions with their close relationship to the limbic system could be causative for eating disorders we therefore recommend performing a cranial MRI in all patients with suspected eating disorders Trummer M et al 2002 intracranial pathology should also be considered however certain is the diagnosis of earlyonset anorexia nervosa Second neuroimaging plays an important part in diagnosing earlyonset anorexia nervosa both from a clinical and a research prospectiveOBrien et al 2001 Psychological After ruling out organic causes and the initial diagnosis of an eating disorder being made by a medical professional a trained mental health professional aids in the assessment and treatment of the underlying psychological components of the eating disorder and any comorbid psychological conditions The clinician conducts a clinical interview and may employ various psychometric tests Some are general in nature while others were devised specifically for use in the assessment of eating disorders Some of the general tests that may be used are the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory longitudinal research showed that there is an increase in chance that a young adult female would develop bulimia due to their current psychological pressure and as the person ages and matures their emotional problems change or are resolved and then the symptoms decline Several types of scales are currently used a selfreport questionnaires EDI3 BSQ TFEQ MAC BULITR QEWPR EDEQ EAT NEQ and other b semistructured interviews SCIDI EDE and other c clinical interviews unstructured or observerbased rating scales Morgan Russel scale The majority of the scales used were described and used in adult populations From all the scales evaluated and analyzed only three are described at the child population it is EAT26 children above 16 years EDI3 children above 13 years and ANSOCQ children above 13 years It is essential to develop specific scales for people under 18 years of age given the increasing incidence of ED among children and the need for early detection and appropriate intervention Moreover the urgent need for accurate scales and telemedicine testing and diagnosis tools are of high importance during the COVID19 pandemic Leti Garner al 2020 Differential diagnoses There are multiple medical conditions which may be misdiagnosed as a primary psychiatric disorder complicating or delaying treatment These may have a synergistic effect on conditions which mimic an eating disorder or on a properly diagnosed eating disorder Lyme disease is known as the great imitator as it may present as a variety of psychiatric or neurological disorders including anorexia nervosa Gastrointestinal diseases such as celiac disease Crohns disease peptic ulcer eosinophilic esophagitis or nonceliac gluten sensitivity among others Celiac disease is also known as the great imitator because it may involve several organs and cause an extensive variety of nongastrointestinal symptoms such as psychiatric and neurological disorders including anorexia nervosa Addisons disease is a disorder of the adrenal cortex which results in decreased hormonal production Addisons disease even in subclinical form may mimic many of the symptoms of anorexia nervosa Gastric adenocarcinoma is one of the most common forms of cancer in the world Complications due to this condition have been misdiagnosed as an eating disorder Hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism hypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism may mimic some of the symptoms of can occur concurrently with be masked by or exacerbate an eating disorder Toxoplasma seropositivity even in the absence of symptomatic toxoplasmosis toxoplasma gondii exposure has been linked to changes in human behavior and psychiatric disorders including those comorbid with eating disorders such as depression In reported case studies the response to antidepressant treatment improved only after adequate treatment for toxoplasma Neurosyphilis It is estimated that there may be up to one million cases of untreated syphilis in the US alone The disease can present with psychiatric symptoms alone psychiatric symptoms that can mimic any other psychiatric illness Many of the manifestations may appear atypical Up to 13 of short term psychiatric admissions may be attributable to neurosyphilis with a much higher rate in the general psychiatric population Ritchie M Perdigao J Dysautonomia a wide variety of autonomic nervous system ANS disorders may cause a wide variety of psychiatric symptoms including anxiety panic attacks and depression Dysautonomia usually involves failure of sympathetic or parasympathetic components of the ANS system but may also include excessive ANS activity Dysautonomia can occur in conditions such as diabetes and alcoholism Psychological disorders which may be confused with an eating disorder or be comorbid with one Emetophobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by an intense fear of vomiting A person so impacted may develop rigorous standards of food hygiene such as not touching food with their hands They may become socially withdrawn to avoid situations which in their perception may make them vomit Many who have emetophobia are diagnosed with anorexia or selfstarvation In severe cases of emetophobia they may drastically reduce their food intake Phagophobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by a fear of eating it is usually initiated by an adverse experience while eating such as choking or vomiting Persons with this disorder may present with complaints of pain while swallowing Body dysmorphic disorder BDD is listed as an obsessivecompulsive disorder that affects up to 2 of the population BDD is characterized by excessive rumination over an actual or perceived physical flaw BDD has been diagnosed equally among men and women While BDD has been misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa it also occurs comorbidly in 39 of eating disorder cases BDD is a chronic and debilitating condition which may lead to social isolation major depression and suicidal ideation and attempts Neuroimaging studies to measure response to facial recognition have shown activity predominately in the left hemisphere in the left lateral prefrontal cortex lateral temporal lobe and left parietal lobe showing hemispheric imbalance in information processing There is a reported case of the development of BDD in a 21yearold male following an inflammatory brain process Neuroimaging showed the presence of a new atrophy in the frontotemporal region Prevention Prevention aims to promote a healthy development before the occurrence of eating disorders It also intends early identification of an eating disorder before it is too late to treat Children as young as ages 57 are aware of the cultural messages regarding body image and dieting Prevention comes in bringing these issues to the light The following topics can be discussed with young children as well as teens and young adults Emotional Bites a simple way to discuss emotional eating is to ask children about why they might eat besides being hungry Talk about more effective ways to cope with emotions emphasizing the value of sharing feelings with a trusted adult Say No to Teasing another concept is to emphasize that it is wrong to say hurtful things about other peoples body sizes Intuitive Eating emphasize the importance of listening to ones body That is eat when you are hungry pay attention to fullness and choose foods that make you feel good Children intuitively grasp these concepts Additionally parents can reinforce intuitive eating by removing value judgments of food as good or bad from conversations about food Positive Body Talk family members can help prevent eating disorders by not making negative comments about themselves When children hear family members complain that they are fat or about the proportions of their bodies this influences their own body image and is a contributing factor to the development of eating disorders Fitness Comes in All Sizes educate children about the genetics of body size and the normal changes occurring in the body Discuss their fears and hopes about growing bigger Focus on fitness and a balanced diet Internet and modern technologies provide new opportunities for prevention Online programs have the potential to increase the use of prevention programs The development and practice of prevention programs via online sources make it possible to reach a wide range of people at minimal cost Such an approach can also make prevention programs to be sustainable Parents can do a lot for their children at a young age to impede them from ever seeing themselves in the eyes of an eating disorder The parents who are actively engaged in their childrens lives often contribute to fostering a stronger sense of selflove in them Treatment Treatment varies according to type and severity of eating disorder and often more than one treatment option is utilized Various forms of cognitive behavioral therapy have been developed for eating disorders and found to be useful If a person is experiencing comorbidity between an eating disorder and OCD exposure and response prevention coupled with weight restoration and serotonin reputake inhibitors has proven most effective Other forms of psychotherapies can also be useful Family doctors play an important role in early treatment of people with eating disorders by encouraging those who are also reluctant to see a psychiatrist Treatment can take place in a variety of different settings such as community programs hospitals day programs and groups The American Psychiatric Association APA recommends a team approach to treatment of eating disorders The members of the team are usually a psychiatrist therapist and registered dietitian but other clinicians may be included That said some treatment methods are Cognitive behavioral therapy CBT which postulates that an individuals feelings and behaviors are caused by their own thoughts instead of external stimuli such as other people situations or events the idea is to change how a person thinks and reacts to a situation even if the situation itself does not change See Cognitive behavioral treatment of eating disorders Acceptance and commitment therapy a type of CBT Cognitive behavioral therapy enhanched CBTE the most widespread cognitive behavioral psychotherapy specific for eating disorders Cognitive remediation therapy CRT a set of cognitive drills or compensatory interventions designed to enhance cognitive functioning Exposure and Response Prevention a type of CBT the gradual exposure to anxiety provoking situations in a safe environment to learn how to deal with the uncomfortableness The Maudsley anorexia nervosa treatment for adults MANTRA which focuses on addressing rigid information processing styles emotional avoidance proanorectic beliefs and difficulties with interpersonal relationships These four targets of treatment are proposed to be core maintenance factors within the CognitiveInterpersonal Maintenance Model of anorexia nervosa Dialectical behavior therapy Family therapy including conjoint family therapy CFT separated family therapy SFT and Maudsley Family Therapy Behavioral therapy focuses on gaining control and changing unwanted behaviors Interpersonal psychotherapy IPT Cognitive Emotional Behaviour Therapy CEBT Art therapy Nutrition counseling and Medical nutrition therapy Selfhelp and guided selfhelp have been shown to be helpful in AN BN and BED this includes support groups and selfhelp groups such as Eating Disorders Anonymous and Overeaters Anonymous Having meaninful relationships are often a way to recovery Having a partner friend or someone else close in your life may lead away from the way of problematic eating according to professor Cynthia M Bulik psychoanalytic psychotherapy Inpatient care There are few studies on the costeffectiveness of the various treatments Treatment can be expensive due to limitations in health care coverage people hospitalized with anorexia nervosa may be discharged while still underweight resulting in relapse and rehospitalization Research has found comorbidity between an eating disorder eg anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa and binge eating and OCD does not impact the length of the time patients spend in treatment but can negatively impact treatment outcomes For children with anorexia the only wellestablished treatment is the family treatmentbehavior For other eating disorders in children however there is no wellestablished treatments though family treatmentbehavior has been used in treating bulimia A 2019 Cochrane review examined studies comparing the effectiveness of inpatient versus outpatient models of care for eating disorders Four trials including 511 participants were studied but the review was unable to draw any definitive conclusions as to the superiority of one model over another Barriers to treatment A variety of barriers to eating disorder treatment have been identified typically grouped into individual and systemic barriers Individual barriers include shame fear of stigma cultural perceptions minimizing the seriousness of the problem unfamiliarity with mental health services and a lack of trust in mental health professionals Systemic barriers include language differences financial limitations lack of insurance coverage inaccessible health care facilities time conflicts long waits lack of transportation and lack of child care These barriers may be particularly exacerbated for those who identify outside of the skinny white affluent girl stereotype that dominates in the field of eating disorders such that those who do not identify with this stereotype are much less likely to seek treatment Conditions during the COVID19 pandemic may increase the difficulties experienced by those with eating disorders and the risk that otherwise healthy individuals may develop eating disorders The pandemic has been a stressful life event for everyone increasing anxiety and isolation disrupting normal routines creating economic strain and food insecurity and making it more difficult and stressful to obtain needed resources including food and medical treatment The COVID19 pandemic in England exposed a dramatic rise in demand for eating disorder services which the English NHS struggled to meet The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and NHS England both advised that services should not impose thresholds using body mass index or duration of illness to determine whether treatment for eating disorders should be offered but there were continuing reports that these recommendations were not followed In terms of access to treatment therapy sessions have generally switched from inperson to video calls This may actually help people who previously had difficulty finding a therapist with experience in treating eating disorders for example those who live in rural areas Studies suggest that virtual telehealth CBT can be as effective as facetoface CBT for bulimia and other mental illnesses To help patients cope with conditions during the pandemic therapists may have to particularly emphasize strategies to create structure where little is present build interpersonal connections and identify and avoid triggers Medication Orlistat is used in obesity treatment Olanzapine seems to promote weight gain as well as the ability to ameliorate obsessional behaviors concerning weight gain zinc supplements have been shown to be helpful and cortisol is also being investigated Two pharmaceuticals Prozac and Vyvanse have been approved by the FDA to treat bulimia nervosa and bingeeating disorder respectively Olanzapine has also been used offlabel to treat anorexia nervosa Studies are also underway to explore psychedelic and psychedelicadjacent medicines such as MDMA psilocybin and ketamine for anorexia nervosa and bingeeating disorder Outcomes For anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder there is a general agreement that full recovery rates range between 50 and 85 with larger proportions of people experiencing at least partial remission It can be a lifelong struggle or it can be overcome within months Miscarriages Pregnant women with a binge eating disorder have shown to have a greater chance of having a miscarriage compared to pregnant women with any other eating disorders According to a study done out of a group of pregnant women being evaluated 467 of the pregnancies ended with a miscarriage in women that were diagnosed with BED with 230 in the control In the same study 214 of women diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa had their pregnancies end with miscarriages and only 177 of the controls Relapse An individual who is in remission from BN and EDNOS Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified is at a high risk of falling back into the habit of selfharm Factors such as high stress regarding their job pressures from society as well as other occurrences that inflict stress on a person can push a person back to what they feel will ease the pain A study tracked a group of selected people that were either diagnosed with BN or EDNOS for 60 months After the 60 months were complete the researchers recorded whether or not the person was having a relapse The results found that the probability of a person previously diagnosed with EDNOS had a 41 chance of relapsing a person with BN had a 47 chance Attachment insecurity People who are showing signs of attachment anxiety will most likely have trouble communicating their emotional status as well as having trouble seeking effective social support Signs that a person has adopted this symptom include not showing recognition to their caregiver or when heshe is feeling pain In a clinical sample it is clear that at the pretreatment step of a patients recovery more severe eating disorder symptoms directly corresponds to higher attachment anxiety The more this symptom increases the more difficult it is to achieve eating disorder reduction prior to treatment Impaired Decision Making Studies have found mixed results on the relationship between eating disorders and decision making Researchers have continuously found that patients with anorexia were less capable of thinking about longterm consequences of their decisions when completing the Iowa Gambling Task a test designed to measure a persons decisionmaking capabilities Consequently they were at a higher risk of making hastier harmful choices Anorexia symptoms include the increasing chance of getting osteoporosis Thinning of the hair as well as dry hair and skin are also very common The muscles of the heart will also start to change if no treatment is inflicted on the patient This causes the heart to have an abnormally slow heart rate along with low blood pressure Heart failure becomes a major consideration when this begins to occur Muscles throughout the body begin to lose their strength This will cause the individual to begin feeling faint drowsy and weak Along with these symptoms the body will begin to grow a layer of hair called lanugo The human body does this in response to the lack of heat and insulation due to the low percentage of body fat Bulimia symptoms include heart problems like an irregular heartbeat that can lead to heart failure and death may occur This occurs because of the electrolyte imbalance that is a result of the constant binge and purge process The probability of a gastric rupture increases A gastric rupture is when there is a sudden rupture of the stomach lining that can be fatal The acids that are contained in the vomit can cause a rupture in the esophagus as well as tooth decay As a result to laxative abuse irregular bowel movements may occur along with constipation Sores along the lining of the stomach called peptic ulcers begin to appear and the chance of developing pancreatitis increases Binge eating symptoms include high blood pressure which can cause heart disease if it is not treated Many patients recognize an increase in the levels of cholesterol The chance of being diagnosed with gallbladder disease increases which affects an individuals digestive tract Risk of death Eating disorders result in about 7000 deaths a year as of 2010 making them the mental illnesses with the highest mortality rate Anorexia has a risk of death that is increased about 5 fold with 20 of these deaths as a result of suicide Rates of death in bulimia and other disorders are similar at about a 2 fold increase The mortality rate for those with anorexia is 54 per 1000 individuals per year Roughly 13 deaths were due to suicide A person who is or had been in an inpatient setting had a rate of 46 deaths per 1000 Of individuals with bulimia about 2 persons per 1000 persons die per year and among those with EDNOS about 33 per 1000 people die per year Epidemiology It is a common misconception that eating disorders are restricted only to women and this may have skewed research disproportionately to study female populations In the developed world binge eating disorder affects about 16 of women and 08 of men in a given year Anorexia affects about 04 and bulimia affects about 13 of young women in a given year Up to 4 of women have anorexia 2 have bulimia and 2 have binge eating disorder at some point in time Anorexia and bulimia occur nearly ten times more often in females than males Typically they begin in late childhood or early adulthood Rates of other eating disorders are not clear Rates of eating disorders appear to be lower in less developed countries In the United States twenty million women and ten million men have an eating disorder at least once in their lifetime Anorexia Rates of anorexia in the general population among women aged 11 to 65 ranges from 0 to 22 and around 03 among men The incidence of female cases is low in general medicine or specialized consultation in town ranging from 42 and 83100000 individuals per year The incidence of AN ranges from 109 to 270100000 individuals per year Mortality varies according to the population considered AN has one of the highest mortality rates among mental illnesses The rates observed are 62 to 106 times greater than that observed in the general population for followup periods ranging from 13 to 10 years Standardized mortality ratios for anorexia vary from 136 to 20 Bulimia Bulimia affects females 9 times more often than males Approximately one to three percent women develop bulimia in their lifetime About 2 to 3 of women are currently affected in the United States New cases occur in about 12 per 100000 population per year The standardized mortality ratios for bulimia is 1 to 3 Binge eating disorder Reported rates vary from 13 to 30 among subjects seeking weightloss treatment Based on surveys BED appears to affect about 12 at some point in their life with 011 of people affected in a given year BED is more common among females than males There have been no published studies investigating the effects of BED on mortality although it is comorbid with disorders that are known to increase mortality risks Economics Since 2017 the number of costeffectiveness studies regarding eating disorders appears to be increasing in the past six years In 2011 United States dollars annual healthcare costs were 1869 greater among individuals with eating disorders compared to the general population The added presence of mental health comorbidities was also associated with higher but not statistically significant costs difference of 1993 In 2013 Canadian dollars the total hospital cost per admission for treatment of anorexia nervosa was 51349 and the total societal cost was 54932 based on an average length of stay of 379 days For every unit increase in body mass index there was also a 157 decrease in hospital cost For Ontario Canada patients who received specialized inpatient care for an eating disorder both out of country and in province annual total healthcare costs were about 11 million before 2007 and 65 million in the years afterwards For those treated out of country alone costs were about 5 million before 2007 and 2 million in the years afterwards Evolutionary perspective Evolutionary psychiatry as an emerging scientific discipline has been studying mental disorders from an evolutionary perspective If eating disorders have evolutionary functions or if they are new modern lifestyle problems is still debated See also Eating disorders in Chinese women Eating disorder not otherwise

    title: "Addiction",
    originalContent:
      "Addiction is a neuropsychological disorder characterized by a persistent and intense urge to use a drug or engage in a behavior that produces natural reward despite substantial harm and other negative consequences Repetitive drug use often alters brain function in ways that perpetuate craving and weakens selfcontrol This phenomenon drugs reshaping brain function has led to an understanding of addiction as a brain disorder with a complex variety of psychosocial as well as neurobiological and thus involuntary factors that are implicated in the development of addiction Classic signs of addiction include compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli preoccupation with substances or behavior and continued use despite negative consequences Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification shortterm reward coupled with delayed deleterious effects longterm costs Examples of substance addiction include alcoholism cannabis addiction amphetamine addiction cocaine addiction nicotine addiction opioid addiction and eating or food addiction Behavioral addictions may include gambling addiction shopping addiction stalking internet addiction social media addiction video game addiction and sexual addiction The DSM5 and ICD10 only recognize gambling addictions as behavioral addictions but the ICD11 also recognizes gaming addictions Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of addiction can vary depending on the type of addiction Symptoms of drug addictions may include Continuation of drug use despite the knowledge of consequences Disregarding financial status when it comes to drug purchases Ensuring a stable supply of the drug Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when stopping the drug Needing more of the drug over time to achieve similar effects Social and work life impacted due to drug use Unsuccessful attempts to stop drug use Urge to use drug regularly Signs and symptoms of addiction may include Definitions Addiction and addictive behaviour are polysemes denoting a category of mental disorders of neuropsychological symptoms or of merely maladaptiveharmful habits and lifestyles A common use of addiction in medicine is for neuropsychological symptoms denoting pervasiveexcessive and intense urges to engage in a category of behavioral compulsions or impulses towards sensory rewards eg alcohol betel quid drugs sex gambling video gaming Addictive disorders or addiction disorders are mental disorders involving high intensities of addictions as neuropsychological symptoms that induce functional disabilities ie limit subjects socialfamily and occupational activities the two categories of such disorders are substanceuse addictions and behavioral addictions The DSM5 classifies addiction the most severe stage of substance use disorder due to significant loss of control and the presence of compulsive behaviours despite the desire to stop It is a definition that many scientific papers and reports use Dependence is also a polyseme denoting either neuropsychological symptoms or mental disorders In the DSM5 dependences differ from addictions and can even normally happen without addictions besides substanceuse dependences are severe stages of substanceuse addictions ie mental disorders involving withdrawal issues In the ICD11 substanceuse dependence is a synonym of substanceuse addiction ie neuropsychological symptoms that can but do not necessarily involve withdrawal issues Substance addiction Drug addiction Drug addiction which belongs to the class of substancerelated disorders is a chronic and relapsing brain disorder that features drug seeking and drug abuse despite their harmful effects This form of addiction changes brain circuitry such that the brains reward system is compromised causing functional consequences for stress management and selfcontrol Damage to the functions of the organs involved can persist throughout a lifetime and cause death if untreated Substances involved with drug addiction include alcohol nicotine marijuana opioids cocaine amphetamines and even foods with high fat and sugar content Addictions can begin experimentally in social contexts and can arise from the use of prescribed medications or a variety of other measures Drug addiction has been shown to work in phenomenological conditioning operant and classical cognitive models and the cue reactivity model However no one model completely illustrates substance abuse Risk factors for addiction include Aggressive behavior particularly in childhood Availability of substance Community economic status Experimentation Epigenetics Impulsivity attentional motor or nonplanning Lack of parental supervision Lack of peer refusal skills Mental disorders Method substance is taken Usage of substance in youth Food addiction The diagnostic criteria for food or eating addiction has not been categorized or defined in references such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM or DSM5 and is based on subjective experiences similar to substance use disorders Food addiction may be found in those with eating disorders though not all people with eating disorders have food addiction and not all of those with food addiction have a diagnosed eating disorder Longterm frequent and excessive consumption of foods high in fat salt or sugar such as chocolate can produce an addiction similar to drugs since they trigger the brains reward system such that the individual may desire the same foods to an increasing degree over time The signals sent when consuming highly palatable foods have the ability to counteract the bodys signals for fullness and persistent cravings will result Those who show signs of food addiction may develop food tolerances in which they eat more despite the food becoming less satisfactory Chocolates sweet flavor and pharmacological ingredients are known to create a strong craving or feel addictive by the consumer A person who has a strong liking for chocolate may refer to themselves as a chocoholic Risk factors for developing food addiction include excessive overeating and impulsivity The Yale Food Addiction Scale YFAS version 20 is the current standard measure for assessing whether an individual exhibits signs and symptoms of food addiction It was developed in 2009 at Yale University on the hypothesis that foods high in fat sugar and salt have addictivelike effects which contribute to problematic eating habits The YFAS is designed to address 11 substancerelated and addictive disorders SRADs using a 25item selfreport questionnaire based on the diagnostic criteria for SRADs as per DSM5 A potential food addiction diagnosis is predicted by the presence of at least two out of 11 SRADs and a significant impairment to daily activities The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale specifically the BIS11 scale and the UPPSP Impulsive Behavior subscales of Negative Urgency and Lack of Perseverance have been shown to have relation to food addiction Behavioral addiction The term behavioral addiction refers to a compulsion to engage in a natural reward which is a behavior that is inherently rewarding ie desirable or appealing despite adverse consequences Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that marked increases in the expression of FosB through repetitive and excessive exposure to a natural reward induces the same behavioral effects and neuroplasticity as occurs in a drug addiction Addiction can exist in the absence of psychotropic drugs which was popularized by Peele These are termed behavioral addictions Such addictions may be passive or active but they commonly contain reinforcing features which are found in most addictions Sexual behavior eating gambling playing video games and shopping are all associated with compulsive behaviors in humans and have been shown to activate the mesolimbic pathway and other parts of the reward system Based on this evidence sexual addiction gambling addiction video game addiction and shopping addiction are classified accordingly Sexual Sexual addiction involves an engagement in excessive compulsive or otherwise problematic sexual behavior that persists despite negative physiological psychological social and occupational consequences Sexual addiction may be referred to as hypersexuality or compulsive sexual behavior disorder The DSM5 does not recognize sexual addiction as a clinical diagnosis Hypersexuality disorder and internet addiction disorder were among proposed addictions to the DSM5 but were later rejected due to the insufficient evidence available in support of the existence of these disorders as discrete mental health conditions Reviews of both clinical research in humans and preclinical studies involving FosB have identified compulsive sexual activity specifically any form of sexual intercourse as an addiction ie sexual addiction Reward crosssensitization between amphetamine and sexual activity meaning that exposure to one increases the desire for both has been shown to occur as a dopamine dysregulation syndrome FosB expression is required for this crosssensitization effect which intensifies with the level of FosB expression Gambling Gambling provides a natural reward that is associated with compulsive behavior Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that gambling activates the reward system and the mesolimbic pathway in particular It is known that dopamine is involved in learning motivation as well as the reward system The exact role of dopamine in gambling addiction has been debated Suggested roles for D2 D3 and D4 dopamine receptors as well as D3 receptors in the substantia nigra have been found in rat and human models showing a correlation with the severity of the gambling behavior This in turn was linked with greater dopamine release in the dorsal striatum Gambling addictions are linked with comorbidities such as mental health disorders substance abuse alcohol use disorder and personality disorders Risk factors for gambling addictions include antisocial behavior impulsive personality male sex sensation seeking substance use and young age Gambling addiction has been associated with some personality traits including harm avoidance low self direction decision making and planning insufficiencies impulsivity as well as sensation seeking individuals Although some personality traits can be linked with gambling addiction there is no general description of individuals addicted to gambling Internet Internet addiction does not have any standardized definition yet there is widespread agreement that this problem exists Debate over the classification of problematic internet use considers whether it should be thought of as a behavioral addiction an impulse control disorder or an obsessivecompulsive disorder Others argue that internet addiction should be considered a symptom of an underlying mental health condition and not a disorder in itself Internet addiction has been described as a psychological dependence on the Internet regardless of the type of activity once logged on Problematic internet use may include a preoccupation with the internet andor digital media excessive time spent using the internet despite resultant distress in the individual increase in the amount of internet use required to achieve the same desired emotional response loss of control over ones internet use habits withdrawal symptoms and continued problematic internet use despite negative consequences to ones work social academic or personal life Studies conducted in India United States Asia and Europe have identified Internet addiction prevalence rates ranging in value from 1 to 19 with the adolescent population having high rates compared to other age groups Prevalence rates have been difficult to establish due to a lack of universally accepted diagnostic criteria a lack of diagnostic instruments demonstrating crosscultural validity and reliability and existing controversy surrounding the validity of labeling problematic internet use as an addictive disorder The most common scale used to measure addiction is the Internet Addiction Test developed by Kimberly Young People with internet addiction are likely to have a comorbid psychiatric disorder Comorbid diagnoses identified alongside internet addiction include affective mood disorders anxiety disorders substance use disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Video games Video game addiction is characterized by the World Health Organization WHO as excessive gaming behavior potentially prioritized over other interests despite the negative consequences that may arise for a period of at least 12 months In May 2019 the WHO introduced gaming disorder in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases Video game addiction has been shown to be more prevalent in males than females higher by 29 times It has been suggested that people of younger ages are more prone to become addicted to video games People with certain personalities may be more susceptible to gaming addictions Risk factors for video game addiction include Male Psychopathologies eg ADHD or MDD and Social anxiety Shopping Shopping addiction or compulsive buying disorder CBD is the excessive urge to shop or spend potentially resulting in unwanted consequences These consequences can have serious impacts such as increased consumer debt negatively affected relationships increased risk of illegal behavior and suicide attempts Shopping addiction occurs worldwide and has shown a 58 prevalence in the United States Similar to other behavioral addictions CBD can be linked to mood disorders substance use disorders eating disorders and other disorders involving a lack of control Screening and assessment Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment The Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment is used to diagnose addiction disorders This tool measures three different domains executive function incentive salience and negative emotionality Executive functioning consists of processes that would be disrupted in addiction In the context of addiction incentive salience determines how one perceives the addictive substance Increased negative emotional responses have been found with individuals with addictions Tobacco Alcohol Prescription Medication and Other Substance Use TAPS This is a screening and assessment tool in one assessing commonly used substances This tool allows for a simple diagnosis eliminating the need for several screening and assessment tools as it includes both TAPS1 and TAPS2 screening and assessment tools respectively The screening component asks about the frequency of use of the specific substance tobacco alcohol prescription medication and other If an individual screens positive the second component will begin This dictates the risk level of the substance CRAFFT The CRAFFT CarRelaxAloneForgetFamily and FriendsTrouble is a screening tool that is used in medical centers The CRAFFT is in version 21 and has a version for nicotine and tobacco use called the CRAFFT 21N This tool is used to identify substance use substance related driving risk and addictions among adolescents This tool uses a set of questions for different scenarios In the case of a specific combination of answers different question sets can be used to yield a more accurate answer After the questions the DSM5 criteria are used to identify the likelihood of the person having substance use disorder After these tests are done the clinician is to give the 5 RS of brief counseling The five Rs of brief counseling includes REVIEW screening results RECOMMEND to not use RIDINGDRIVING risk counseling RESPONSE elicit selfmotivational statements REINFORCE selfefficacy Drug Abuse Screening Test DAST10 The Drug Abuse Screening Test DAST is a selfreporting tool that measures problematic substance use Responses to this test are recorded as yes or no answers and scored as a number between zero and 28 Drug abuse or dependence are indicated by a cut off score of 6 Three versions of this screening tool are in use DAST28 DAST20 and DAST10 Each of these instruments are copyrighted by Dr Harvey A Skinner Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Test ASSIST The Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Test ASSIST is an interviewbased questionnaire consisting of eight questions developed by the WHO The questions ask about lifetime use frequency of use urge to use frequency of health financial social or legal problems related to use failure to perform duties if anyone has raised concerns over use attempts to limit or moderate use and use by injection Causes Personality theories Personality theories of addiction are psychological models that associate personality traits or modes of thinking ie affective states with an individuals proclivity for developing an addiction Data analysis demonstrates that psychological profiles of drug users and nonusers have significant differences and the psychological predisposition to using different drugs may be different Models of addiction risk that have been proposed in psychology literature include an affect dysregulation model of positive and negative psychological affects the reinforcement sensitivity theory of impulsiveness and behavioral inhibition and an impulsivity model of reward sensitization and impulsiveness Neuropsychology The transtheoretical model of change TTM can point to how someone may be conceptualizing their addiction and the thoughts around it including not being aware of their addiction Cognitive control and stimulus control which is associated with operant and classical conditioning represent opposite processes ie internal vs external or environmental respectively that compete over the control of an individuals elicited behaviors Cognitive control and particularly inhibitory control over behavior is impaired in both addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Stimulusdriven behavioral responses ie stimulus control that are associated with a particular rewarding stimulus tend to dominate ones behavior in an addiction Stimulus control of behavior In operant conditioning behavior is influenced by outside stimulus such as a drug The operant conditioning theory of learning is useful in understanding why the moodaltering or stimulating consequences of drug use can reinforce continued use an example of positive reinforcement and why the addicted person seeks to avoid withdrawal through continued use an example of negative reinforcement Stimulus control is using the absence of the stimulus or presence of a reward to influence the resulting behavior Cognitive control of behavior Cognitive control is the intentional selection of thoughts behaviors and emotions based on our environment It has been shown that drugs alter the way our brains function and its structure Cognitive functions such as learning memory and impulse control are affected by drugs These effects promote drug use as well as hinder the ability to abstain from it The increase in dopamine release is prominent in drug use specifically in the ventral striatum and the nucleus accumbens Dopamine is responsible for producing pleasurable feelings as well driving us to perform important life activities Addictive drugs cause a significant increase in this reward system causing a large increase in dopamine signaling as well as increase in rewardseeking behavior in turn motivating drug use This promotes the development of a maladaptive drug to stimulus relationship Early drug use leads to these maladaptive associations later affecting cognitive processes used for coping which are needed to successfully abstain from them Risk factors A number of genetic and environmental risk factors exist for developing an addiction Genetic and environmental risk factors each account for roughly half of an individuals risk for developing an addiction the contribution from epigenetic risk factors to the total risk is unknown Even in individuals with a relatively low genetic risk exposure to sufficiently high doses of an addictive drug for a long period of time eg weeksmonths can result in an addiction Adverse childhood events are associated with negative health outcomes such as substance use disorder Childhood abuse or exposure to violent crime is related to developing a mood or anxiety disorder as well as a substance dependence risk Genetic factors Genetic factors along with socioenvironmental eg psychosocial factors have been established as significant contributors to addiction vulnerability Studies done on 350 hospitalized drugdependent patients showed that over half met the criteria for alcohol abuse with a role of familial factors being prevalent Genetic factors account for 4060 of the risk factors for alcoholism Similar rates of heritability for other types of drug addiction have been indicated specifically in genes that encode the Alpha5 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Knestler hypothesized in 1964 that a gene or group of genes might contribute to predisposition to addiction in several ways For example altered levels of a normal protein due to environmental factors may change the structure or functioning of specific brain neurons during development These altered brain neurons could affect the susceptibility of an individual to an initial drug use experience In support of this hypothesis animal studies have shown that environmental factors such as stress can affect an animals genetic expression In humans twin studies into addiction have provided some of the highestquality evidence of this link with results finding that if one twin is affected by addiction the other twin is likely to be as well and to the same substance Further evidence of a genetic component is research findings from family studies which suggest that if one family member has a history of addiction the chances of a relative or close family developing those same habits are much higher than one who has not been introduced to addiction at a young age The data implicating specific genes in the development of drug addiction is mixed for most genes Many addiction studies that aim to identify specific genes focus on common variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5 in the general population When associated with disease these only confer a small amount of additional risk with an odds ratio of 1113 percent this has led to the development the rare variant hypothesis which states that genes with low frequencies in the population 1 confer much greater additional risk in the development of the disease Genomewide association studies GWAS are used to examine genetic associations with dependence addiction and drug use These studies rarely identify genes from proteins previously described via animal knockout models and candidate gene analysis Instead large percentages of genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion are commonly identified The important effects of endophenotypes are typically not capable of being captured by these methods Genes identified in GWAS for drug addiction may be involved either in adjusting brain behavior before drug experiences subsequent to them or both Environmental factors Environmental risk factors for addiction are the experiences of an individual during their lifetime that interact with the individuals genetic composition to increase or decrease his or her vulnerability to addiction For example after the nationwide outbreak of COVID19 more people quit vs started smoking and smokers on average reduced the quantity of cigarettes they consumed More generally a number of different environmental factors have been implicated as risk factors for addiction including various psychosocial stressors The National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA and studies cite lack of parental supervision the prevalence of peer substance use substance availability and poverty as risk factors for substance use among children and adolescents The brain disease model of addiction posits that an individuals exposure to an addictive drug is the most significant environmental risk factor for addiction Many researchers including neuroscientists indicate that the brain disease model presents a misleading incomplete and potentially detrimental explanation of addiction The psychoanalytic theory model defines addiction as a form of defense against feelings of hopelessness and helplessness as well as a symptom of failure to regulate powerful emotions related to adverse childhood experiences ACEs various forms of maltreatment and dysfunction experienced in childhood In this case the addictive substance provides brief but total relief and positive feelings of control The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown a strong doseresponse relationship between ACEs and numerous health social and behavioral problems throughout a persons lifespan including substance use disorder Childrens neurological development can be permanently disrupted when they are chronically exposed to stressful events such as physical emotional or sexual abuse physical or emotional neglect witnessing violence in the household or a parent being incarcerated or having a mental illness As a result the childs cognitive functioning or ability to cope with negative or disruptive emotions may be impaired Over time the child may adopt substance use as a coping mechanism or as a result of reduced impulse control particularly during adolescence Vast amounts of children who experienced abuse have gone on to have some form of addiction in their adolescence or adult life This pathway towards addiction that is opened through stressful experiences during childhood can be avoided by a change in environmental factors throughout an individuals life and opportunities of professional help If one has friends or peers who engage in drug use favorably the chances of them developing an addiction increases Family conflict and home management is a cause for one to become engaged in drug use Social control theory According to Travis Hirschis social control theory adolescents with stronger attachments to family religious academic and other social institutions are less likely to engage in delinquent and maladaptive behavior such as drug use leading to addiction Age Adolescence represents a period of increased vulnerability for developing an addiction In adolescence the incentiverewards systems in the brain mature well before the cognitive control center This consequentially grants the incentiverewards systems a disproportionate amount of power in the behavioral decisionmaking process Therefore adolescents are increasingly likely to act on their impulses and engage in risky potentially addicting behavior before considering the consequences Not only are adolescents more likely to initiate and maintain drug use but once addicted they are more resistant to treatment and more liable to relapse Most individuals are exposed to and use addictive drugs for the first time during their teenage years In the United States there were just over 28 million new users of illicit drugs in 2013 7800 new users per day among them 541 were under 18 years of age In 2011 there were approximately 206 million people in the United States over the age of 12 with an addiction Over 90 of those with an addiction began drinking smoking or using illicit drugs before the age of 18 Comorbid disorders Individuals with comorbid ie cooccurring mental health disorders such as depression anxiety attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder ADHD or posttraumatic stress disorder are more likely to develop substance use disorders The NIDA cites early aggressive behavior as a risk factor for substance use The National Bureau of Economic Research found that there is a definite connection between mental illness and the use of addictive substances and a majority of mental health patients participate in the use of these substances 38 alcohol 44 cocaine and 40 cigarettes Epigenetic Epigenetics is the study of stable phenotypic changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence Illicit drug use has been found to cause epigenetic changes in DNA methylation as well as chromatin remodeling The epigenetic state of chromatin may pose as a risk for the development of substance addictions It has been found that emotional stressors as well as social adversities may lead to an initial epigenetic response which causes an alteration to the rewardsignalling pathways This change may predispose one to experience a positive response to drug use Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance Epigenetic genes and their products eg proteins are the key components through which environmental influences can affect the genes of an individual they serve as the mechanism responsible for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance a phenomenon in which environmental influences on the genes of a parent can affect the associated traits and behavioral phenotypes of their offspring eg behavioral responses to environmental stimuli In addiction epigenetic mechanisms play a central role in the pathophysiology of the disease it has been noted that some of the alterations to the epigenome which arise through chronic exposure to addictive stimuli during an addiction can be transmitted across generations in turn affecting the behavior of ones children eg the childs behavioral responses to addictive drugs and natural rewards The general classes of epigenetic alterations that have been implicated in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance include DNA methylation histone modifications and downregulation or upregulation of microRNAs With respect to addiction more research is needed to determine the specific heritable epigenetic alterations that arise from various forms of addiction in humans and the corresponding behavioral phenotypes from these epigenetic alterations that occur in human offspring Based on preclinical evidence from animal research certain addictioninduced epigenetic alterations in rats can be transmitted from parent to offspring and produce behavioral phenotypes that decrease the offsprings risk of developing an addiction More generally the heritable behavioral phenotypes that are derived from addictioninduced epigenetic alterations and transmitted from parent to offspring may serve to either increase or decrease the offsprings risk of developing an addiction Mechanisms Addiction is a disorder of the brains reward system developing through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms as a result of chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus eg eating food the use of cocaine engagement in sexual activity participation in highthrill cultural activities such as gambling etc over extended time DeltaFosB FosB a gene transcription factor is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions Two decades of research into FosBs role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates along with the overexpression of FosB in the D1type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens Due to the causal relationship between FosB expression and addictions it is used preclinically as an addiction biomarker FosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug selfadministration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement while decreasing sensitivity to aversion Chronic addictive drug use causes alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are FosB cAMP response element binding protein CREB and nuclear factor kappa B NFB FosB is the most significant biomolecular mechanism in addiction because the overexpression of FosB in the D1type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations and behavioral effects eg expressiondependent increases in drug selfadministration and reward sensitization seen in drug addiction FosB expression in nucleus accumbens D1type medium spiny neurons directly and positively regulates drug selfadministration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement while decreasing sensitivity to aversion FosB has been implicated in mediating addictions to many different drugs and drug classes including alcohol amphetamine and other substituted amphetamines cannabinoids cocaine methylphenidate nicotine opiates phenylcyclidine and propofol among others JunD a transcription factor and G9a a histone methyltransferase both oppose the function of FosB and inhibit increases in its expression Increases in nucleus accumbens JunD expression via viral vectormediated gene transfer or G9a expression via pharmacological means reduces or with a large increase can even block many of the neural and behavioral alterations that result from chronic highdose use of addictive drugs ie the alterations mediated by FosB FosB plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards such as palatable food sex and exercise Natural rewards like drugs of abuse induce gene expression of FosB in the nucleus accumbens and chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological addictive state through FosB overexpression Consequently FosB is the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards ie behavioral addictions as well in particular FosB in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the reinforcing effects of sexual reward Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that dopaminergic psychostimulants eg amphetamine and sexual behavior act on similar biomolecular mechanisms to induce FosB in the nucleus accumbens and possess bidirectional crosssensitization effects that are mediated through FosB This phenomenon is notable since in humans a dopamine dysregulation syndrome characterized by druginduced compulsive engagement in natural rewards specifically sexual activity shopping and gambling has been observed in some individuals taking dopaminergic medications FosB inhibitors drugs or treatments that oppose its action may be an effective treatment for addiction and addictive disorders The release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens plays a role in the reinforcing qualities of many forms of stimuli including naturally reinforcing stimuli like palatable food and sex Altered dopamine neurotransmission is frequently observed following the development of an addictive state In humans and lab animals that have developed an addiction alterations in dopamine or opioid neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens and other parts of the striatum are evident Use of certain drugs eg cocaine affect cholinergic neurons that innervate the reward system in turn affecting dopamine signaling in this region A recent study in Addiction reports that GLP1 agonist medications such as semaglutide which are commonly used for diabetes and weight management may also reduce the risk of overdose and alcohol intoxication in people with substance use disorders The study analyzed nearly nine years of health records from 13 million individuals across 136 US hospitals including 500000 with opioid use disorder and over 800000 with alcohol use disorder Researchers found that those who used Ozempic or similar medications had a 40 lower risk of opioid overdose and a 50 lower risk of alcohol intoxication compared to those not using these drugs Reward system Mesocorticolimbic pathway Understanding the pathways in which drugs act and how drugs can alter those pathways is key when examining the biological basis of drug addiction The reward pathway known as the mesolimbic pathway or its extension the mesocorticolimbic pathway is characterized by the interaction of several areas of the brain The projections from the ventral tegmental area VTA are a network of dopaminergic neurons with colocalized postsynaptic glutamate receptors AMPAR and NMDAR These cells respond when stimuli indicative of a reward are present The VTA supports learning and sensitization development and releases dopamine DA into the forebrain These neurons project and release DA into the nucleus accumbens through the mesolimbic pathway Virtually all drugs causing drug addiction increase the DA release in the mesolimbic pathway The nucleus accumbens NAcc is one output of the VTA projections The nucleus accumbens itself consists mainly of GABAergic medium spiny neurons MSNs The NAcc is associated with acquiring and eliciting conditioned behaviors and is involved in the increased sensitivity to drugs as addiction progresses Overexpression of FosB in the nucleus accumbens is a necessary common factor in essentially all known forms of addiction FosB is a strong positive modulator of positively reinforced behaviors The prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices is another VTA output in the mesocorticolimbic pathway it is important for the integration of information which helps determine whether a behavior will be elicited It is critical for forming associations between the rewarding experience of drug use and cues in the environment Importantly these cues are strong mediators of drugseeking behavior and can trigger relapse even after months or years of abstinence Other brain structures that are involved in addiction include The basolateral amygdala projects into the NAcc and is thought to be important for motivation The hippocampus is involved in drug addiction because of its role in learning and memory Much of this evidence stems from investigations showing that manipulating cells in the hippocampus alters DA levels in NAcc and firing rates of VTA dopaminergic cells Role of dopamine and glutamate Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter of the reward system in the brain It plays a role in regulating movement emotion cognition motivation and feelings of pleasure Natural rewards like eating as well as recreational drug use cause a release of dopamine and are associated with the reinforcing nature of these stimuli Nearly all addictive drugs directly or indirectly act on the brains reward system by heightening dopaminergic activity Excessive intake of many types of addictive drugs results in repeated release of high amounts of dopamine which in turn affects the reward pathway directly through heightened dopamine receptor activation Prolonged and abnormally high levels of dopamine in the synaptic cleft can induce receptor downregulation in the neural pathway Downregulation of mesolimbic dopamine receptors can result in a decrease in the sensitivity to natural reinforcers Drug seeking behavior is induced by glutamatergic projections from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens This idea is supported with data from experiments showing that drug seeking behavior can be prevented following the inhibition of AMPA glutamate receptors and glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens Reward sensitization Reward sensitization is a process that causes an increase in the amount of reward specifically incentive salience that is assigned by the brain to a rewarding stimulus eg a drug In simple terms when reward sensitization to a specific stimulus eg a drug occurs an individuals wanting or desire for the stimulus itself and its associated cues increases Reward sensitization normally occurs following chronically high levels of exposure to the stimulus FosB expression in D1type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens has been shown to directly and positively regulate reward sensitization involving drugs and natural rewards Cueinduced wanting or cuetriggered wanting a form of craving that occurs in addiction is responsible for most of the compulsive behavior that people with addictions exhibit During the development of an addiction the repeated association of otherwise neutral and even nonrewarding stimuli with drug consumption triggers an associative learning process that causes these previously neutral stimuli to act as conditioned positive reinforcers of addictive drug use ie these stimuli start to function as drug cues As conditioned positive reinforcers of drug use these previously neutral stimuli are assigned incentive salience which manifests as a craving sometimes at pathologically high levels due to reward sensitization which can transfer to the primary reinforcer eg the use of an addictive drug with which it was originally paired Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that dopaminergic psychostimulants eg amphetamine and sexual behavior act on similar biomolecular mechanisms to induce FosB in the nucleus accumbens and possess a bidirectional reward crosssensitization effect that is mediated through FosB In contrast to FosBs rewardsensitizing effect CREB transcriptional activity decreases users sensitivity to the rewarding effects of the substance CREB transcription in the nucleus accumbens is implicated in psychological dependence and symptoms involving a lack of pleasure or motivation during drug withdrawal Neuroepigenetic mechanisms Altered epigenetic regulation of gene expression within the brains reward system plays a significant and complex role in the development of drug addiction Addictive drugs are associated with three types of epigenetic modifications within neurons These are 1 histone modifications 2 epigenetic methylation of DNA at CpG sites at or adjacent to particular genes and 3 epigenetic downregulation or upregulation of microRNAs which have particular target genes As an example while hundreds of genes in the cells of the nucleus accumbens NAc exhibit histone modifications following drug exposure particularly altered acetylation and methylation states of histone residues most other genes in the NAc cells do not show such changes Diagnosis Classification DSM5 The fifth edition of the DSM uses the term substance use disorder to refer to a spectrum of drug userelated disorders The DSM5 eliminates the terms abuse and dependence from diagnostic categories instead using the specifiers of mild moderate and severe to indicate the extent of disordered use These specifiers are determined by the number of diagnostic criteria present in a given case In the DSM5 the term drug addiction is synonymous with severe substance use disorder The DSM5 introduced a new diagnostic category for behavioral addictions Problem gambling is the only condition included in this category in the fifth edition Internet gaming disorder is listed as a condition requiring further study in the DSM5 Past editions have used physical dependence and the associated withdrawal syndrome to identify an addictive state Physical dependence occurs when the body has adjusted by incorporating the substance into its normal functioning ie attains homeostasis and therefore physical withdrawal symptoms occur on cessation of use Tolerance is the process by which the body continually adapts to the substance and requires increasingly larger amounts to achieve the original effects Withdrawal refers to physical and psychological symptoms experienced when reducing or discontinuing a substance that the body has become dependent on Symptoms of withdrawal generally include but are not limited to body aches anxiety irritability intense cravings for the substance dysphoria nausea hallucinations headaches cold sweats tremors and seizures During acute physical opioid withdrawal symptoms of restless legs syndrome are common and may be profound This phenomenon originated the idiom kicking the habit Medical researchers who actively study addiction have criticized the DSM classification of addiction for being flawed and involving arbitrary diagnostic criteria ICD11 The eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases commonly referred to as ICD11 conceptualizes diagnosis somewhat differently ICD11 first distinguishes between problems with psychoactive substance use Disorders due to substance use and behavioral addictions Disorders due to addictive behaviours With regard to psychoactive substances ICD11 explains that the included substances initially produce pleasant or appealing psychoactive effects that are rewarding and reinforcing with repeated use but with continued use many of the included substances have the capacity to produce dependence They have the potential to cause numerous forms of harm both to mental and physical health Instead of the DSM5 approach of one diagnosis Substance Use Disorder covering all types of problematic substance use ICD11 offers three diagnostic possibilities 1 Episode of Harmful Psychoactive Substance Use 2 Harmful Pattern of Psychoactive Substance Use and 3 Substance Dependence Prevention Abuse liability Abuse or addiction liability is the tendency to use drugs in a nonmedical situation This is typically for euphoria mood changing or sedation Abuse liability is used when the person using the drugs wants something that they otherwise can not obtain The only way to obtain this is through the use of drugs When looking at abuse liability there are a number of determining factors in whether the drug is abused These factors are the chemical makeup of the drug the effects on the brain and the age vulnerability and the health mental and physical of the population being studied There are a few drugs with a specific chemical makeup that leads to a high abuse liability These are cocaine heroin inhalants marijuana MDMA ecstasy methamphetamine PCP synthetic cannabinoids synthetic cathinones bath salts nicotine eg tobacco and alcohol Potential vaccines for addiction to substances Vaccines for addiction have been investigated as a possibility since the early 2000s The general theory of a vaccine intended to immunize against drug addiction or other substance abuse is that it would condition the immune system to attack and consume or otherwise disable the molecules of such substances that cause a reaction in the brain thus preventing the addict from being able to realize the effect of the drug Addictions that have been floated as targets for such treatment include nicotine opioids and fentanyl Vaccines have been identified as potentially being more effective than other antiaddiction treatments due to the long duration of action the certainty of administration and a potential reduction of toxicity to important organs Specific addiction vaccines in development include NicVAX a conjugate vaccine intended to reduce or eliminate physical dependence on nicotine This proprietary vaccine is being developed by Nabi Biopharmaceuticals of Rockville MD with the support from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse NicVAX consists of the hapten 3aminomethylnicotine which has been conjugated attached to Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A TACD an active vaccine developed by the Xenova Group which is used to negate the effects of cocaine It is created by combining norcocaine with inactivated cholera toxin It works in much the same way as a regular vaccine A large protein molecule attaches to cocaine which stimulates response from antibodies which destroy the molecule This also prevents the cocaine from crossing the bloodbrain barrier negating the euphoric high and rewarding effect of cocaine caused from stimulation of dopamine release in the mesolimbic reward pathway The vaccine does not affect the users desire for cocaineonly the physical effects of the drug TANIC used to create human antibodies to destroy nicotine in the human body so that it is no longer effective As of September 2023 it was further reported that a vaccine has been tested against heroin and fentanyl and is on its way to being tested against OxyContin Treatment and management To be effective treatment for addiction that is pharmacological or biologically based need to be accompanied by other interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy CBT individual and group psychotherapy behavior modification strategies twelvestep programs and residential treatment facilities The transtheoretical model TTM can be used to determine when treatment can begin and which method will be most effective If treatment begins too early it can cause a person to become defensive and resistant to change Epidemiology Due to cultural variations the proportion of individuals who develop a drug or behavioral addiction within a specified time period ie the prevalence varies over time by country and across national population demographics eg by age group socioeconomic status etc Where addiction is viewed as unacceptable there will be fewer people addicted Asia The prevalence of alcohol dependence is not as high as is seen in other regions In Asia not only socioeconomic factors but biological factors influence drinking behavior Internet addiction disorder is highest in the Philippines according to both the IAT Internet Addiction Test 5 and the CIASR Revised Chen Internet Addiction Scale 21 Australia The prevalence of substance use disorder among Australians was reported at 51 in 2009 In 2019 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare conducted a national drug survey that quantified drug use for various types of drugs and demographics The survey found that in 2019 11 of people over 14 years old smoke daily that 99 of those who drink alcohol which equates to 75 of the total population age 14 or older may qualify as alcohol dependent that 175 of the 24 million people who used cannabis in the last year may have hazardous use or a dependence problem and that 635 of about 300000 recent users of meth and amphetamines were at risk for developing problem use Europe In 2015 the estimated prevalence among the adult population was 184 for heavy episodic alcohol use in the past 30 days 152 for daily tobacco smoking and 38 for cannabis use 077 for amphetamine use 037 for opioid use and 035 for cocaine use in 2017 The mortality rates for alcohol and illicit drugs were highest in Eastern Europe Data shows a downward trend of alcohol use among children 15 years old in most European countries between 2002 and 2014 Firsttime alcohol use before the age of 13 was recorded for 28 of European children in 2014 United States Based on representative samples of the US youth population in 2011 the lifetime prevalence of addictions to alcohol and illicit drugs has been estimated to be approximately 8 and 23 respectively Based on representative samples of the US adult population in 2011 the 12month prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug addictions were estimated at 12 and 23 respectively The lifetime prevalence of prescription drug addictions is around 47 As of 2021 437 million people aged 12 or older surveyed by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in the United States needed treatment for an addiction to alcohol nicotine or other drugs The groups with the highest number of people were 1825 years 251 and American Indian or Alaska Native 287 Only about 10 or a little over 2 million receive any form of treatments and those that do generally do not receive evidencebased care Onethird of inpatient hospital costs and 20 of all deaths in the US every year are the result of untreated addictions and risky substance use In spite of the massive overall economic cost to society which is greater than the cost of diabetes and all forms of cancer combined most doctors in the US lack the training to effectively address a drug addiction Estimates of lifetime prevalence rates in the US are 12 for compulsive gambling 5 for sexual addiction 28 for food addiction and 56 for compulsive shopping The timeinvariant prevalence rate for sexual addiction and related compulsive sexual behavior eg compulsive masturbation with or without pornography compulsive cybersex etc within the US ranges from 36 of the population According to a 2017 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center almost half of US adults know a family member or close friend who has struggled with a drug addiction at some point in their life In 2019 opioid addiction was acknowledged as a national crisis in the United States An article in The Washington Post stated that Americas largest drug companies flooded the country with pain pills from 2006 through 2012 even when it became apparent that they were fueling addiction and overdoses The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found that from 2012 to 2013 the prevalence of Cannabis use disorder in US adults was 29 Canada A Statistics Canada Survey in 2012 found the lifetime prevalence and 12month prevalence of substance use disorders were 216 and 44 in those 15 and older Alcohol abuse or dependence reported a lifetime prevalence of 181 and a 12month prevalence of 32 Cannabis abuse or dependence reported a lifetime prevalence of 68 and a 12month prevalence of 32 Other drug abuse or dependence has a lifetime prevalence of 40 and a 12month prevalence of 07 Substance use disorder is a term used interchangeably with a drug addiction In Ontario Canada between 2009 and 2017 outpatient visits for mental health and addiction increased from 526 to 572 per 100 people emergency department visits increased from 135 to 197 per 1000 people and the number of hospitalizations increased from 45 to 55 per 1000 people Prevalence of care needed increased the most among the 1417 age group overall South America The realities of opioid use and opioid use disorder in Latin America may be deceptive if observations are limited to epidemiological findings In the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report although South America produced 3 of the worlds morphine and heroin and 001 of its opium prevalence of use is uneven According to the InterAmerican Commission on Drug Abuse Control consumption of heroin is low in most Latin American countries although Colombia is the areas largest opium producer Mexico because of its border with the United States has the highest incidence of use Addiction and the humanities History and etymology The etymology of the term addiction throughout history has been misunderstood and has taken on various meanings associated with the word An example is the usage of the word in the religious landscape of early modern Europe Addiction at the time meant to attach to something giving it both positive and negative connotations The object of this attachment could be characterized as good or bad The meaning of addiction during the early modern period was mostly associated with positivity and goodness during this early modern and highly religious era of Christian revivalism and Pietistic tendencies it was seen as a way of devoting oneself to another Modern research on addiction has led to a better understanding of the disease with research on the topic dating back to 1875 specifically on morphine addiction This furthered the understanding of addiction being a medical condition It was not until the 19th century that addiction was seen and acknowledged in the Western world as a disease being both a physical condition and mental illness Today addiction is understood both as a biopsychosocial and neurological disorder that negatively impacts those who are affected by it most commonly associated with the use of drugs and excessive use of alcohol The understanding of addiction has changed throughout history which has impacted and continues to impact the ways it is medically treated and diagnosed The suffixes holic and holism In contemporary modern English holic is a suffix that can be added to a subject to denote an addiction to it It was extracted from the word alcoholism one of the first addictions to be widely identified both medically and socially correctly the root alcohol plus the suffix ism by misdividing or rebracketing it into alco and holism There are correct medicolegal terms for such addictions dipsomania is the medicolegal term for alcoholism other examples are in this table Arts The arts can be used in a variety of ways to address issues related to addiction Art can be used as a form of therapy in the treatment of substance use disorders Creative activities like painting sculpting music and writing can help people express their feelings and experiences in safe and healthy ways The arts can be used as an assessment tool to identify underlying issues that may be contributing to a persons substance use disorder Through art individuals can gain insights into their own motivations and behaviors that can be helpful in determining a course of treatment Finally the arts can be used to advocate for those suffering from a substance use disorder by raising awareness of the issue and promoting understanding and compassion Through art individuals can share their stories increase awareness and offer support and hope to those struggling with substance use disorders As therapy Addiction treatment is complex and not always effective due to engagement and service availability concerns so researchers prioritize efforts to improve treatment retention and decrease relapse rates Characteristics of substance abuse may include feelings of isolation a lack of confidence communication difficulties and a perceived lack of control In a similar vein people suffering from substance use disorders tend to be highly sensitive creative and as such are likely able to express themselves meaningfully in creative arts such as dancing painting writing music and acting Further evidenced by Waller and Mahony 2002 and Kaufman 1981 the creative arts therapies can be a suitable treatment option for this population especially when verbal communication is ineffective Primary advantages of art therapy in the treatment of addiction have been identified as Assess and characterize a clients substance use issues Bypassing a clients resistances defenses and denial Containing shame or anger Facilitating the expression of suppressed andor complicated emotions Highlighting a clients strengths Providing an alternative to verbal communication via use of symbols and conventional forms of therapy Providing clients with a sense of control Tackling feelings of isolation Art therapy is an effective method of dealing with substance abuse in comprehensive treatment models When included in psychoeducational programs art therapy in a group setting can help clients internalize taught concepts in a more personalized manner During the course of treatment by examining and comparing artwork created at different times art therapists can be helpful in identifying and diagnosing issues as well as charting the extent or direction of improvement as a person detoxifies Where increasing adherence to treatment regimes and maintaining abstinence is the target art therapists can aid by customizing treatment directives encourage the client to create collages that compare pros and cons pictures that compare past and present and future and drawings that depict what happened when a client went off medication Art therapy can function as a complementary therapy used in conjunction with more conventional therapies and can can integrate with harm reduction protocols to minimize the negative effects of drug use An evaluation of art therapy incorporation within a preexisting Addiction Treatment Programme based on the 12 step Minnesota Model endorsed by the Alcoholics Anonymous found that 66 of participants expressed the usefulness of art therapy as a part of treatment Within the weekly art therapy session clients were able to reflect and process the intense emotions and cognitions evoked by the programme In turn the art therapy component of the programme fostered stronger selfawareness exploration and externalization of repressed and unconscious emotions of clients promoting the development of a more integrated authentic self Despite the large number of randomized control trials clinical control trials and anecdotal evidence supporting the effectiveness of art therapies for use in addiction treatment a systematic review conducted in 2018 could not find enough evidence on visual art drama dance and movement therapy or arts in health methodologies to confirm their effectiveness as interventions for reducing substance misuse Music therapy was identified to have potentially strong beneficial effects in aiding contemplation and preparing those diagnosed with substance use for treatment As an assessment tool The Formal Elements Art Therapy Scale FEATS is an assessment tool used to evaluate drawings created by people suffering from substance use disorders by comparing them to drawings of a control group consisting of individuals without SUDs FEATS consists of twelve elements three of which were found to be particularly effective at distinguishing the drawings of those with SUDs from those without Person Realism and Developmental The Person element assesses the degree to which a human features are depicted realistically the Realism element assesses the overall complexity of the artwork and the Developmental element assesses developmental age of the artwork in relation to standardized drawings from children and adolescents By using the FEATS assessment tool clinicians can gain valuable insight into the drawings of individuals with SUDs and can compare them to those of the control group Formal assessments such as FEATS provide healthcare providers with a means to quantify standardize and communicate abstract and visceral characteristics of SUDs to provide more accurate diagnoses and informed treatment decisions Other artistic assessment methods include the Birds Nest Drawing a useful tool for visualizing a clients attachment security This assessment method looks at the amount of color used in the drawing with a lack of color indicating an insecure attachment a factor that the clients therapist or recovery framework must take into account Art therapists working with children of parents suffering from alcoholism can use the Kinetic Family Drawings assessment tool to shed light on family dynamics and help children express and understand their family experiences The KFD can be used in family sessions to allow children to share their experiences and needs with parents who may be in recovery from alcohol use disorder Depiction of isolation of self and isolation of other family members may be an indicator of parental alcoholism Advocacy Stigma can lead to feelings of shame that can prevent people with substance use disorders from seeking help and interfere with provision of harm reduction services It can influence healthcare policy making it difficult for these individuals to access treatment Artists attempt to change the societal perception of addiction from a punishable moral offense to instead a chronic illness necessitating treatment This form of advocacy can help to relocate the fight of addiction from a judicial perspective to the public health system Artists who have personally lived with addiction andor undergone recovery may use art to depict their experiences in a manner that uncovers the human face of addiction By bringing experiences of addiction and recovery to a personal level and breaking down the us and them the viewer may be more inclined to show compassion forego stereotypes and stigma of addiction and label addiction as a social rather than individual problem According to Santora the main purposes in using art as a form of advocacy in the education and prevention of substance use disorders include Addiction art exhibitions can come from a variety of sources but the underlying message of these works is the same to communicate through emotions without relying on intellectually demandinggatekept facts and figures These exhibitions can either stand alone reinforce or challenge facts A powerful educational tool for increasing awareness and understanding of addiction as a medical illness Exhibitions featuring personal stories and images can help to create lasting impressions on diverse audiences including addiction scientistsresearchers familyfriends of those affected by addiction etc highlighting the humanity of the problem and in turn encouraging compassion and understanding A way to destigmatize substance use disorders and shift public perception from viewing them as a moral failing to understanding them as a chronic medical condition which requires treatment Provide those who are struggling with addiction assurance and encouragement of healing and let them know that they are not alone in their struggle The use of visual arts can help bring attention to the lack of adequate substance use treatment prevention and education programs and services in a healthcare system Messages can encourage policymakers to allocate more resources to addiction treatment and prevention from federal state and local levels The Temple University College of Public Health department conducted a project to promote awareness around opioid use and reduce associated stigma by asking students to create art pieces that were displayed on a website they created and promoted via social media Quantitative and qualitative data was recorded to measure engagement and the student artists were interviewed which revealed a change in perspective and understanding as well as greater appreciation of diverse experiences Ultimately the project found that art was an effective medium for empowering both the artist creating the work and the person interacting with it Another author critically examined works by contemporary Canadian artists that deal with addiction via the metaphor of a cultural landscape to unmap and remap ideologies related to Indigenous communities and addiction to demonstrate how colonial violence in Canada has drastically impacted the relationship between Indigenous peoples their land and substance abuse A project known as Voice was a collection of art poetry and narratives created by women living with a history of addiction to explore womens understanding of harm reduction challenge the effects of stigma and give voice to those who have historically been silenced or devalued In the project nurses with knowledge of mainstream systems aesthetic knowing feminism and substance use organized weekly gatherings wherein women with histories of substance use and addiction worked alongside a nurse to create artistic expressions Creations were presented at several venues including an International Conference on Drug Related Harm a Nursing Conference and a local gallery to positive community response Narrative Approach and Addiction The narrative medicine to addiction focuses on recognizing absorbing and interpreting the stories of those suffering from addiction allowing for better understanding of their experiences with narrative analysis being used to study the discourse of those with addiction This knowledge can be used to develop better care plans with the potential to increase patient compliance and make treatment more effective A narrative study demonstrated and studied cognitive and emotional tendencies among substance abusers during treatment periods to learn more about motivation and ambivalence inherent in recovery over the course of a residential treatment program Seven narrative types emerged from the overall analysis optimistic overly optimistic pessimistic overly pessimistic tough life troubledconfused and balanced Narratives tended to express a basic level of emotionality in early stages of treatment optimistic pessimistic narrative Over time as clients progressed through the program their stories became more complex and detailed including their drug abuse and recovery efforts more skeptical positions towards treatment began to emerge Clients began to distinguish between the positive and negative aspects of treatment creating more balanced narratives in the process Due to higher medication consumption social isolation financial worries and other factors older adults are particularly vulnerable to substance use problems Incidence of addiction among this population is inaccurately reported Narrative therapy can provide an avenue to unearth stories of addiction in an empowering manner and thus serves as a viable therapeutic tool in applied gerontology When treating substance abuse in older adults it is essential to ensure that the client is respected and comfortable disclosing information This should be done at the outset of treatment when the therapist and older adult are developing the therapeutic relationship The social breakdown model is an important tool that can consider the compounded effects of ageism physical changes social changes and substance abuse The narrative approach integrates the social breakdown model with substance abuse challenges and can be an effective way to address addiction in this population A study conducted in 2009 in the Republic of Moldova looked into the social dynamics of initiating injection drug usage by examining 42 audiorecorded semistructured interviews with present and former injectors A thematic analysis suggested that selfinjection was viewed as a symbolic transition of identity enabled by interpersonal interactions and collective influences Personal narratives of selftransition were connected to larger narratives of social transitions The personal narratives of selfinitiation and transition are contextualized and understood in terms of political social narratives within the core concept of the transitional society Another study examined the narratives of initiators people who help people who inject drugs PWID with their first injection Through their accounts respondents described initiation events as meaningful transitions to a life characterized by predictable downfalls of homelessness infections and social stigma Initiators used examples from their own personal experience to explain the process of initiation and assistance attributing personal agency and predicting specific injectionrelated harms for initiates They distinguished between two forms of harm potentially avoidable proximal harm caused by risky injection practices eg overdose HIV and perceived inevitable distal harm caused by longterm injection eg socioeconomic decline In this way these narratives reflect a balance of individual agency harm reduction intentions and accepted notions of life after initiation interact with the narrative experiences and intentions of PWIDs Philosophy From a philosophy perspective the behavior of many with addiction that is not explained by executive dysfunction or biological reasons can be explained by folk psychology specifically the beliefdesire model According to this model a person acquires and uses a substance or does an addictive activity in belief that it will help them achieve a goal Social scientific models Biopsychosocialculturalspiritual While regarded biomedically as a neuropsychological disorder addiction is multilayered with biological psychological social cultural and spiritual biopsychosocialculturalspiritual elements A biopsychosocialculturalspiritual approach fosters the crossing of disciplinary boundaries and promotes holistic considerations of addiction A biopsychosocialculturalspiritual approach considers for example how physical environments influence experiences habits and patterns of addiction Ethnographic engagements and developments in fields of knowledge have contributed to biopsychosocialculturalspiritual understandings of addiction including the work of Philippe Bourgois whose fieldwork with streetlevel drug dealers in East Harlem highlights correlations between drug use and structural oppression in the United States Prior models that have informed the prevailing biopsychosocialculturalspiritual consideration of addiction include Cultural model The cultural model an anthropological understanding of the emergence of drug use and abuse was developed by Dwight Heath Heath undertook ethnographic research and fieldwork with the Camba people of Bolivia from June 1956 to August 1957 Heath observed that adult members of society drank large quantities of rum and became intoxicated for several contiguous days at least twice a month This frequent heavy drinking from which intoxication followed was typically undertaken socially during festivals Having returned in 1989 Heath observed that while much had changed drinking parties remained as per his initial observations and there appear to be no harmful consequences to anyone Heaths observations and interactions reflected that this form of social behavior the habitual heavy consumption of alcohol was encouraged and valued enforcing social bonds in the Camba community Despite frequent intoxication even to the point of unconsciousness the Camba held no concept of alcoholism a form of addiction and no visible social problems associated with drunkenness or addiction were apparent As noted by Merrill Singer Heaths findings when considered alongside subsequent crosscultural experiences challenged the perception that intoxication is socially inherently disruptive Following this fieldwork Heath proposed the cultural model suggesting that problems associated with heavy drinking such as alcoholism a recognised form addiction were cultural that is that alcoholism is determined by cultural beliefs and therefore varies among cultures Heaths findings challenged the notion that continued use of alcohol is inexorably addictive and damaging to the consumers health The cultural model did face criticism by Sociologist Robin Room and others who felt anthropologists could downgrade the severity of the problem Merrill Singer found it notable that the ethnographers working within the prominence of the cultural model were part of the wet generation while not blind to the disruptive dysfunctional and debilitating effects of alcohol consumption they were products socialized to view alcohol consumption as normal Subcultural model Historically addiction has been viewed from the etic perspective defining users through the pathology of their condition As reports of drug use rapidly increased the cultural model found application in anthropological research exploring western drug subculture practices The approach evolved from the ethnographic exploration into the lived experiences and subjectivities of 1960s and 1970s drug subcultures The seminal publication Taking care of business by Edward Preble and John J Casey documented the daily lives of New York streetbased intravenous heroin users in rich detail providing unique insight into the dynamic social worlds and activities that surrounded their drug use These findings challenge popular narratives of immorality and deviance conceptualizing substance abuse as a social phenomenon The prevailing culture can have a greater influence on drug taking behaviors than the physical and psychological effects of the drug itself To marginalized individuals drug subcultures can provide social connection symbolic meaning and socially constructed purpose that they may feel is unattainable through conventional means The subcultural model demonstrates the complexities of addiction highlighting the need for an integrated approach It contends that a biosocial approach is required to achieve a holistic understanding of addiction Critical medical anthropology model Emerging in the early 1980s the critical medical anthropology model was introduced and as Merrill Singer offers was applied quickly to the analysis of drug use Where the cultural model of the 1950s looked at the social body the critical medical anthropology model revealed the body politic considering drug use and addiction within the context of macro level structures including larger political systems economic inequalities and the institutional power held over social processes Highly relevant to addiction the three issues emphasized in the model are Selfmedication The social production of suffering The political economy Licit and Illicit Drugs These three key points highlight how drugs may come to be used to selfmedicate the psychological trauma of sociopolitical disparity and injustice intertwining with licit and illicit drug market politics Social suffering the misery among those on the weaker end of power relations in terms of physical health mental health and lived experience is used by anthropologists to analyze how individuals may have personal problems caused by political and economic power From the perspective of critical medical anthropology heavy drug use and addiction is a consequence of such larger scale unequal distributions of power The three models developed here the cultural model the subcultural model and the Critical Medical Anthropology Model display how addiction is not an experience to be considered only biomedically Through consideration of addiction alongside the biological psychological social cultural and spiritual biopsychosocialspiritual elements which influence its experience a holistic and comprehensive understanding can be built Social learning models Social learning theory Albert Banduras 1977 social learning theory posits that individuals acquire addictive behaviors by observing and imitating models in their social environment The likelihood of engaging in and sustaining similar addictive behaviors is influenced by the reinforcement and punishment observed in others The principle of reciprocal determinism suggests that the functional relationships between personal environmental and behavioral factors act as determinants of addictive behavior Thus effective treatment targets each dynamic facet of the biopsychosocial disorder Transtheoretical model stages of change model The transtheoretical model of change suggests that overcoming an addiction is a stepwise process that occurs through several stages Precontemplation This initial stage precedes individuals considering a change in their behavior They might be oblivious to or in denial of their addiction failing to recognize the need for change Contemplation is the stage in which individuals become aware of the problems caused by their addiction and are considering change Although they may not fully commit they weigh the costs and benefits of making a shift Preparation Individuals in this stage are getting ready to change They might have taken preliminary steps like gathering information or making small commitments in preparation for behavioral change Action involves actively modifying behavior by making specific observable changes to address the addictive behavior The action stage requires significant effort and commitment Maintenance After successfully implementing a change individuals enter the maintenance stage where they work to sustain the new behavior and prevent relapse This stage is characterized by ongoing effort and consolidation of gains Terminationrelapse prevention Recognizing that relapse is a common part of the change process this stage focuses on identifying and addressing factors that may lead to a return to old behaviors Relapse is viewed as an opportunity for learning and strategy adjustment with the ultimate goal of eliminating or terminating the targeted behavior The transtheoretical model can be helpful in guiding development of tailored behavioral interventions that can promote lasting change Progression through these stages may not always follow a linear path as individuals may move back and forth between stages Resistance to change is recognized as an expected part of the process Addiction causes an astoundingly high financial and human toll on individuals and society as a whole In the United States the total economic cost to society is greater than that of all types of diabetes and all cancers combined These costs arise from the direct adverse effects of drugs and associated healthcare costs eg emergency medical services and outpatient and inpatient care longterm complications eg lung cancer from smoking tobacco products liver cirrhosis and dementia from chronic alcohol consumption and meth mouth from methamphetamine use the loss of productivity and associated welfare costs fatal and nonfatal accidents eg traffic collisions suicides homicides and incarceration among others The US National Institute on Drug Abuse has found that overdose deaths in the US have almost tripled among male and females from 2002 to 2017 with 72306 overdose deaths reported in 2017 in the US 2020 marked the year with highest number of overdose deaths over a 12month period with 81000 overdose deaths exceeding the records set in 2017 See also Endnotes Notes Image legend References Further reading External links The Science of

    title: "Consumer behavior",
    originalContent:
      "Consumer behaviour is the study of individuals groups or organisations and all activities associated with the purchase use and disposal of goods and services It encompasses how the consumers emotions attitudes and preferences affect buying behaviour Consumer behaviour emerged in the 19401950s as a distinct subdiscipline of marketing but has become an interdisciplinary social science that blends elements from psychology sociology social anthropology anthropology ethnography ethnology marketing and economics especially behavioural economics The study of consumer behaviour formally investigates individual qualities such as demographics personality lifestyles and behavioural variables like usage rates usage occasion loyalty brand advocacy and willingness to provide referrals in an attempt to understand peoples wants and consumption patterns Consumer behaviour also investigates on the influences on the consumer from social groups such as family friends sports and reference groups to society in general brandinfluencers opinion leaders Due to the unpredictability of consumer behavior marketers and researchers use ethnography consumer neuroscience and machine learning along with customer relationship management CRM databases to analyze customer patterns The extensive data from these databases allows for a detailed examination of factors influencing customer loyalty repurchase intentions and other behaviors like providing referrals and becoming brand advocates Additionally these databases aid in market segmentation particularly behavioral segmentation enabling the creation of highly targeted and personalized marketing strategies Origins of consumer behaviour In the 1940s and 1950s marketing was dominated by the socalled classical schools of thought which were highly descriptive and relied heavily on case study approaches with only occasional use of interview methods At the end of the 1950s two important reports criticised marketing for its lack of methodological rigor especially the failure to adopt mathematicallyoriented behavioural science research methods The stage was set for marketing to become more interdisciplinary by adopting a consumerbehaviourist perspective From the 1950s marketing began to shift its reliance away from economics and towards other disciplines notably the behavioural sciences including sociology anthropology and clinical psychology This resulted in a new emphasis on the customer as a unit of analysis As a result new substantive knowledge was added to the marketing discipline including such ideas as opinion leadership reference groups and brand loyalty Market segmentation especially demographic segmentation based on socioeconomic status SES index and household lifecycle also became fashionable With the addition of consumer behaviour the marketing discipline exhibited increasing scientific sophistication with respect to theory development and testing procedures In its early years consumer behaviour was heavily influenced by motivation research which had increased the understanding of customers and had been used extensively by consultants in the advertising industry and also within the discipline of psychology in the 1920s 1930s and 1940s By the 1950s marketing began to adopt techniques used by motivation researchers including depth interviews projective techniques thematic apperception tests and a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods More recently scholars have added a new set of tools including ethnography photoelicitation techniques and phenomenological interviewing In addition to these contemporary research has delved further into the complexities of consumer behavior incorporating innovative approaches such as neuroimaging studies and big data analytics These modern tools provide deeper insights into subconscious consumer motivations and decisionmaking processes Today consumer behaviour or CB as it is affectionately known is regarded as an important subdiscipline within marketing and is included as a unit of study in almost all undergraduate marketing programs Definition and explanation Consumer behaviour means entails all activities associated with the purchase use and disposal of goods and services including the consumers emotional mental and behavioural responses that precede or follow these activities The term consumer can refer to individual consumers as well as organisational consumers and more specifically an end user and not necessarily a purchaser in the distribution chain of a good or service Consumer behaviour is concerned with purchase activities the purchase of goods or services how consumers acquire products and services and all the activities leading up to a purchase decision including information search evaluating goods and services and payment methods including the purchase experience use or consumption activities concerns the who where when and how of consumption and the usage experience including the symbolic associations and the way that goods are distributed within families or consumption units disposal activities concerns the way that consumers dispose of products and packaging may also include reselling activities such as eBay and secondhand markets Consumer responses may be emotional or affective responses refer to emotions such as feelings or moods mental or cognitive responses refer to the consumers thought processes their behavioural or conative responses refer to the consumers observable responses in relation to the purchase and disposal of goods or services According to the American Marketing Association consumer behaviour can be defined as the dynamic interaction of affect and cognition behaviour and environmental events by which human beings conduct the exchange aspects of their lives As a field of study consumer behaviour is an applied social science Consumer behaviour analysis is the use of behaviour principles usually gained experimentally to interpret human economic consumption As a discipline consumer behaviour stands at the intersection of economic psychology and marketing science The purchase decision and its context Understanding purchase and consumption behaviour is a key challenge for marketers Consumer behaviour in its broadest sense is concerned with understanding both how purchase decisions are made and how products or services are consumed or experienced Consumers are active decisionmakers They decide what to purchase often based on their disposable income or budget They may change their preferences related to their budget and a range of other factors Some purchase decisions involve long detailed processes that include extensive information search to select between competing alternatives Other purchase decisions consumers must make highly complex decisions often based on a lack of time knowledge or negotiating ability Such as impulse buys or habitual purchases are made almost instantaneously with little or no investment of time or effort in information search Some purchase decisions are made by groups such as families households or businesses while others are made by individuals When a purchase decision is made by a small group such as a household different members of the group may become involved at different stages of the decision process and may perform different roles For example one person may suggest the purchase category another may search for productrelated information while yet another may physically go to the store buy the product and transport it home It is customary to think about the types of decision roles such as The Initiator the person who proposes a brand or product for consideration something in return The Influencer someone who recommends a given brand The Decider the person who makes the ultimate purchase decision The Purchaser the one who orders or physically buys it The User the person who uses or consumes the product For most purchase decisions each of the decision roles must be performed but not always by the same individual For example in the case of family making a decision about a diningout venue a parent may initiate the process by intimating that they are too tired to cook The children are important influencers in the overall purchase decision but both parents may act as joint deciders performing a gatekeeping role by vetoing unacceptable alternatives and encouraging more acceptable alternatives The importance of children as influencers in a wide range of purchase contexts should never be underestimated and the phenomenon is known as pester power To approach the mental processes used in purchasing decisions some authors employ the concept of the black box which represents the cognitive and affective processes used by a consumer during a purchase decision The decision model situates the black box in a broader environment which shows the interaction of external and internal stimuli eg consumer characteristics situational factors marketing influences and environmental factors as well as consumer responses The black box model is related to the black box theory of behaviourism where the focus extends beyond processes occurring inside the consumer and also includes the relation between the stimuli and the consumers response The decision model assumes that purchase decisions do not occur in a vacuum Rather they occur in real time and are affected by other stimuli including external environmental stimuli and the consumers momentary situation The elements of the model include interpersonal stimuli between people or intrapersonal stimuli within people environmental stimuli and marketing stimuli Marketing stimuli include actions planned and carried out by companies whereas environmental stimuli include actions or events occurring in the wider operating environment and include social economic political and cultural dimensions In addition the buyers black box includes buyer characteristics and the decision process which influence the buyers responses Problem recognition The first stage of the purchase decision process begins with problem recognition also known as category need or need arousal This is when the consumer identifies a need typically defined as the difference between the consumers current state and their desired or ideal state A simpler way of thinking about problem recognition is that it is where the consumer decides that they are in the market for a product or service to satisfy some need or want The strength of the underlying need drives the entire decision process Theorists identify three broad classes of problemsolving situation relevant for the purchase decision Extensive problemsolving Purchases that warrant greater deliberation more extensive information search and evaluation of alternatives These are typically expensive purchases or purchases with high social visibility eg fashion cars Limited problemsolving Known or familiar purchases regular purchases straight rebuys Typically lowpriced items Routinised problemsolving Repeat purchases or habitual purchases Consumers become aware of a problem in a variety of ways including OutofStock Natural Depletion When a consumer needs to replenish stocks of a consumable item eg ran out of milk or bread Regular purchase When a consumer purchases a product on a regular basis eg newspaper magazines Dissatisfaction When a consumer is not satisfied with the current product or service New Needs or Wants Lifestyle changes may trigger the identification of new needs eg the arrival of a baby may prompt the purchase of a cot stroller and carseat for the baby Related products The purchase of one product may trigger the need for accessories spare parts or complementary goods and services eg the purchase of a printer leads to the need for ink cartridges the purchase of a digital camera leads to the need for memory cards Marketerinduced problem recognition When marketing activity persuades consumers of a problem usually a problem that the consumer did not realise they had The consciously and subconsciously consumed content in traditional as well as social media greatly plays the role of a stimulus for the consumers recognition of a new need New Products or Categories When consumers become aware of new innovative products that offer a superior means of fulfilling a need Disruptive technologies such as the advent of wirelessfree communications devices can trigger a need for plethora of products such as a new mouse or printer Information search During the information search and evaluation stages the consumer works through processes designed to arrive at a number of brands or products that represent viable purchase alternatives Typically consumers first carry out an internal search and scan their memory for suitable brands The evoked set is the set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory and is typically a very small set of some 3 5 alternatives Consumers may choose to supplement the number of brands in the evoked set by carrying out an external search using sources such as the Internet manufacturerbrand websites shopping around product reviews referrals from peers and the like The readiness of information availability has raised the informedness of the consumers the degree to which they know what is available in the marketplace with precisely which attributes and at precisely what price The fact that a consumer is aware of a brand does not necessarily mean that it is being considered as a potential purchase For instance the consumer may be aware of certain brands but not favourably disposed towards them known as the inept set Such brands will typically be excluded from further evaluation as purchase options For other brands the consumer may have indifferent feelings the inert set As the consumer approaches the actual purchase they distill the mental list of brands into a set of alternatives that represent realistic purchase options known as the consideration set By definition the consideration set refers to the small set of brands which a consumer pays close attention to when making a purchase decision This ultimately leads to a choice set which includes the alternatives that are strong contenders for purchase Specific brand names enter the consumers consideration set based on the extent to which they satisfy the consumers purchasing objectives andor the salience or accessibility of the brand at the time of making the purchase decision By implication brand names that are more memorable are more likely to be accessible Traditionally one of the main roles of advertising and promotion was to increase the likelihood that a brand name was included in the consumers evoked set Repeated exposure to brand names through intensive advertising was the primary method for increasing topofmind brand awareness However the advent of the Internet means that consumers can obtain brandproduct information from a multiplicity of different platforms In practice the consideration set has assumed greater importance in the purchase decision process because consumers are no longer totally reliant on memory This is marketing which could be defined as the process by which companies create value for customers and build strong customer relationships in order to capture value from customers in return This definition strongly implies that the relationship is built upon an exchange and the creation of value This means that a need is built for a consumer with the product presented or advertised to them through an analytical study of the users patterns of consumption and their behaviours and habits The implication for marketers is that relevant brand information should be disseminated as widely as possible and included on any forum where consumers are likely to search for product or brand information whether traditional media or digital media channels Thus marketers require a rich understanding of the typical consumers touchpoints Evaluation of alternatives Consumer evaluation can be viewed as a distinct stage Alternatively evaluation may occur continuously throughout the entire decision process Consumers evaluate alternatives in terms of the functional also called utilitarian and psychosocial also called the valueexpressive or the symbolic benefits offered Functional benefits are the tangible outcomes that can be experienced by the consumer such as taste or physical appearance Psychosocial benefits are the more abstract outcomes or the personalityrelated attributes of a brand such as the social currency that might accrue from wearing an expensive suit or designer label or driving a hot car Brand image or brand personality is an important psychosocial attribute Consumers can have both positive and negative beliefs about a given brand A considerable body of research suggests that consumers are predisposed towards brands with a personality that matches their own and that a good match can affect brand preference brand choice satisfaction with a brand brand commitment and loyalty and the consumers propensity to give positive wordofmouth referrals The branch of consumer behaviour that investigates the matching of a brands personality and the consumers personality is known as selfcongruity research The social media presence of a brand plays a huge part in this stage with the effect described as Think of regular media as a oneway street where you can read a newspaper or listen to a report on television but you have very limited ability to give your thoughts on the matter Social media on the other hand is a twoway street that gives you the ability to communicate too Consumer beliefs about a brand or product category may vary depending on a range of factors including the consumers prior experience and the effects of selective perception distortion and retention Consumers who are less knowledgeble about a category tend to evaluate a brand based on its functional characteristics However when consumers become more knowledgeable functional attributes diminish and consumers process more abstract information about the brand notably the selfrelated aspects The marketing organisation needs a deep understanding of the benefits most valued by consumers and therefore which attributes are most important in terms of the consumers purchase decision It also needs to monitor other brands in the customers consideration set to optimise planning for its own brand During the evaluation of alternatives the consumer ranks or assesses the relative merits of different options available No universal evaluation process is used by consumers across allbuying situations Instead consumers generate different evaluation criteria depending on each unique buying situation Social media further enables consumers to share views with their peers about the product they are looking to purchase This way consumers can gauge the positive and negative sides of each alternative and decide even more conveniently as for the best product to buy Thus the relevant evaluation attributes vary according to across different types of consumers and purchase contexts For example attributes important for evaluating a restaurant would include food quality price location atmosphere quality of service and menu selection Consumers depending on their geographic demographic psychographic and behavioural characteristics will decide which attributes are important to them Potential patrons seeking a pleasant dining experience may be willing to travel further distances to patronise a finedining venue compared to those wanting a quick meal at a more utilitarian eatery After evaluating the different product attributes the consumer ranks each attribute or benefit from highly important to least important These priorities are directly related to the consumers needs and wants Thus the consumer arrives at a weighted score for each product or brand which represents the consumers subjective assessment of individual attribute scores weighted in terms of their importance Using these scores they arrive at a total mental score or rank for each productbrand under consideration Purchase decision Once the alternatives have been evaluated the consumer firms up their resolve to proceed through to the actual purchase For example the consumer might say to themself Yes I will buy Brand X one day This self instruction to make a purchase is known as purchase intent Purchase intentions are a strong yet imperfect predictor of sales Sometimes purchase intentions simply do not translate into an actual purchase and this can signal a marketing problem For instance a consumer may wish to buy a new product but may be unaware of the retail outlets that stock it so that purchase cannot proceed The extent to which purchase intentions result in actual sales is known as the sales conversion rate Organisations use a variety of techniques to improve conversion rates The provision of easy credit or payment terms may encourage purchase Sales promotions such as the opportunity to receive a premium or enter a competition may provide an incentive to buy now rather than defer purchases for a later date Advertising messages with a strong calltoaction are yet another device used to convert customers A calltoaction is any device designed to encourage immediate sale Typically a calltoaction includes specific wording in an advertisement or selling pitch that employs imperative verbs such as Buy now or Dont wait Other types of callstoaction might provide consumers with strong reasons for purchasing immediately such an offer that is only available for a limited time eg Offer must expire soon Limited stocks available or a special deal usually accompanied by a time constraint eg Order before midnight to receive a free gift with your order Two for the price of one for the first 50 callers only Additionally service convenience is a saving of effort in the way that it minimises the activities that customers may bear to buy goods and services The key to a powerful calltoaction is to provide consumers with compelling reasons to purchase promptly rather than defer purchase decisions As consumers approach the actual purchase decision they are more likely to rely on personal sources of information For this reason personal sales representatives must be well versed in giving sales pitches and in tactics used to close the sale Methods used might include social evidence where the salesperson refers to previous success and satisfaction from other customers buying the product Scarcity attraction is another technique where the salesperson mentions that the offer is limited as it forces the consumer to make a quicker decision and therefore spend less time evaluating alternatives Postpurchase evaluation Following purchase and after experiencing the product or service the consumer enters the final stage namely postpurchase evaluation Foxall suggested that postpurchase evaluation can provide key feedback to marketers because it influences future purchase patterns and consumption activities The post purchase stage is where the consumer examines and compares product features such as price functionality and quality with their expectations Post purchase evaluation can be viewed as the steps taken by consumers to correlate their expectations with perceived value and thus influence their next purchase decision for that good or service For example if a consumer buys a new phone and their postpurchase evaluation is positive they will be encouraged to purchase the same brand or from the same company in the future This is also known as postpurchase intention On the contrary if a consumer is dissatisfied with the new phone they may take actions to resolve the dissatisfaction Consumer actions in this instance could involve requesting a refund making a complaint deciding not to purchase the same brand or from the same company in the future or even spreading negative product reviews to friends or acquaintances possibly via social media After acquisition consumption or disposition consumers may feel some uncertainty in regards to the decision made generating in some cases regret Postdecision dissonance also known as cognitive dissonance is the feeling of anxiety that occurs in the post purchase stage as well as the uneasy feelings or concerns as to whether or not the correct decision was made at purchase Some consumers for instance may regret that they did not purchase one of the other brands they were considering This type of anxiety can affect consumers subsequent behaviour and may have implications for repeat patronage and customer loyalty Consumers use a number of strategies to reduce post purchase dissonance A typical strategy is to look to peers or significant others for validation of the purchase choice Customers have always been led by the opinions of friends and family but nowadays this is corroborated by social media likes reviews and testimonials Marketing communications can also be used to remind consumers that they made a wise choice by purchasing Brand X When consumers make unfavorable comparisons between the chosen option and the options forgone they may feel postdecision regret or buyers remorse Consumers can also feel shortterm regret when they avoid making a purchase decision however this regret can dissipate over time Through their experiences consumers can learn and also engage in a process called hypothesis testing This refers to the formation of hypotheses about the products or a service through prior experience or word of mouth communications There are four stages that consumers go through in the hypothesis testing Hypothesis generation exposure of evidence encoding of evidence and integration of evidence Influences on purchase decision Purchasing is influenced by a wide range of internal and external factors Consumer awareness Consumer awareness refers to the awareness of the consumption of goods bought by consumers in the longterm shopping environment and purchasing activities The change of life concept is the subjective factor of the change of consumer awareness As peoples living standards and incomes continue to increase peoples life concepts are constantly changing Differences in consumer personality are the internal motivations for changes in consumer awareness Intensified market competition is a catalyst for changes in consumer awareness Many companies have launched their own branded products in order to gain a foothold in an increasingly competitive market In the face of a variety of goods and brands consumers brand awareness matures When people buy goods paying attention to the brand has become a fashion Faced with the severe competition situation companies began to realize the importance of implementing brand strategy and began to focus on market research and on this basis deeply grasp the consumers psychological pulse to improve market share and brand loyalty With the change of peoples life concept consumers rational consumption psychology has become increasingly prominent Social Marketing Customised Marketing brandname shopping and the consumers perception of the price of the commodity directly expressed as the consumers sensitivity to price are all main factors for understanding consumer attitudes and help explain the reaction of market demand to price changes Internal influences on purchase decision Internal influences refer to both personal and interpersonal factors Social theory suggests that individuals have both a personal identity and a social identity Personal identity consists of unique personal characteristics such as skills and capabilities interests and hobbies Social identity consists of the individuals perception of the central groups to which an individual belongs and may refer to an age group a lifestyle group religious group educational group or some other reference group Social psychologists have established that the need to belong is one of the fundamental human needs Purchasing behaviour is therefore influenced by a broad range of internal factors such as psychological socioeconomic demographic and personality factors Demographic factors include income level psychographics lifestyles age occupation and socioeconomic status Personality factors include knowledge attitudes personal values beliefs emotions and feelings Psychological factors include an individuals motivation attitudes personal values and beliefs Social identity factors include culture subculture and reference groups Other factors that may affect the purchase decision include the environment and the consumers prior experience with the category or brand Motivations and emotions The consumers underlying motivation drives consumer action including the information search and purchase decision The consumers attitude to a brand or brand preference is described as a link between the brand and a purchase motivation These motivations may be negative to avoid pain or unpleasantness or positive to achieve some type of reward such as sensory gratification One approach to understanding motivations was developed by Abraham Maslow Maslows hierarchy of needs is based on five levels of needs organised accordingly to the level of importance Maslows five needs are Physiological basic levels of needs such as food water and sleep Safety the need for physical safety shelter and security Belonging the need for love friendship and also a desire for group acceptance Esteem The need for status recognition and selfrespect Selfactualisation The desire for selffulfillment eg personal growth artistic expression Physiological needs and safety needs are the socalled lower order needs Consumers typically use most of their resources time energy and finances attempting to satisfy these lower order needs before the higher order needs of belonging esteem and selfactualisation become meaningful Part of any marketing program requires an understanding of which motives drive given product choices Marketing communications can illustrate how a product or brand fulfills these needs Maslows approach is a generalised model for understanding human motivations in a wide variety of contexts but is not specific to purchasing decisions Another approach proposes eight purchase motivations five negative motives and three positive motives which energise purchase decisions as illustrated in the table below These motivations are believed to provide positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement In the marketing literature the consumers motivation to search for information and engage in the purchase decision process is sometimes known as involvement Consumer involvement has been defined as the personal relevance or importance of a message or a decision Purchase decisions are classified as low involvement when consumers experience only a small psychosocial loss in the event that they make a poor decision On the other hand a purchase decision is classified as high involvement when psychosocial risks are perceived to be relatively high The consumers level of involvement is dependent on a number of factors including perceived risk of negative consequences in the event of a poor decision the social visibility of the product and the consumers prior experience with the product category Perception Part of marketing strategy is to ascertain how consumers gain knowledge and use information from external sources The perception process is where individuals receive organise and interpret information in order to attribute some meaning Perception involves three distinct processes sensing information selecting information and interpreting information Sensation is also part of the perception process and it is linked direct with responses from the senses creating some reaction towards the brand name advertising and packaging The process of perception is uniquely individual and may depend on a combination of internal and external factors such as experiences expectations needs and the momentary set When exposed to a stimulus consumers may respond in entirely different ways due to individual perceptual processes A number of processes potentially support or interfere with perception Selective exposure occurs when consumers decide whether to be exposed to information inputs Selective attention occurs when consumers focus on some messages to the exclusion of others Selective comprehension is where the consumer interprets information in a manner that is consistent with their own beliefs Selective retention occurs when consumers remember some information while rapidly forgetting other information Collectively the processes of selective exposure attention comprehension and retention lead individual consumers to favor certain messages over others The way that consumers combine information inputs to arrive at a purchase decision is known as integration Marketers are interested in consumer perceptions of brands packaging product formulations labeling and pricing Of special interest is the threshold of perception also known as the just noticeable difference in a stimulus For example how much should a marketer lower a price before consumers recognise it as a bargain In addition marketers planning to enter global markets need to be aware of cultural differences in perception For example westerners associate the colour white with purity cleanliness and hygiene but in eastern countries white is often associated with mourning and death Accordingly white packaging would be an inappropriate colour choice for food labels on products to be marketed in Asia Symbolic Consumer Behaviour Symbolic consumption becomes the internal influence of consumer behaviour and forms a special symbol Consumption symbols can be used to explain the consumer as a group member or a unique individual Consumer consumption behaviour is not only material and psychological consumption Symbolic consumption has two meanings 1 A symbol of consumption Consumption expresses and transmits a certain meaning and message The meaning derived from culture enables us to use products to symbolise our membership in various social groups This symbolic consumption is the process of social expression and social communication 2 Symbolic consumption People consume not only the commodities themselves but also certain cultural and social significance symbolised or represented by them including mood beauty grade status status atmosphere style emotional appeal etc Symbolic consumption is typically reflected in brand consumption Brand has three functions for consumers functional value symbolic value and experience value Take luxury brands The power of luxury brands is more than just their ability to convey identity Some consumers want to make an impression Luxury goods used to be the daily routine of the aristocracy but after the concept of modern social class was blurred consumers still regarded it as a ticket to enter the upper class Consumers evaluate a brand based on how it aligns with our identity which helps define and maintain our selfconcept As a symbol of noble status wealth and success it has become a consumer identity and status symbol Prior experience The consumers prior experience with the category product or brand can have a major bearing on purchase decisionmaking Experienced consumers also called experts are more sophisticated consumers they tend to be more skillful information searchers canvass a broader range of information sources and use complex heuristics to evaluate purchase options Novice consumers on the other hand are less efficient information searchers and tend to perceive higher levels of purchase risk on account of their unfamiliarity with the brand or category When consumers have prior experience they have less motivation to search for information and spend less effort on information search but can process new information more efficiently One study for example found that as consumer experience increases consumers consider a wider range of purchase alternatives that is they generate a larger consideration set but only at the product category level Random factor Random factors refer to special occasions and a series of random conditions consumers have when purchasing Sometimes consumer purchase decisions are made in unexpected circumstances or a situation will delay or shorten peoples decisionmaking process Research has found that in waiting for scenarios where consumers are ubiquitous seemingly unrelated physical cues such as area carpets or queue guidelines can act as virtual boundaries that alter consumers initial decisions External influences on purchase decision Purchasing behaviour can also be affected by external influences such as culture subculture social class reference groups family and situational determinants Culture Culture is the broadest and most abstract of the external factors Culture refers to the complexity of learning meanings values norms and customs shared by members of a society Cultural norms are relatively stable over time so culture has a major effect on consumer behaviour Research studies have consistently shown that culture influences almost every aspect of purchasing it affects basic psychological domains such as selfidentity and motivation the way that information is processed and the way that advertising messages are interpreted Additionally perceived value and happiness are critical in shaping consumers attitudes and behavioral intentions The cultural choice of consumption behaviour the decisive external factor the overall social and cultural atmosphere and the decisive internal factor the consumers artistic quality aesthetic pursuit and cultural value orientation The cultural choice of consumption must be restricted by two decisive factors inside and outside The socalled social and cultural atmosphere is embodied in the influence of consumption atmosphere customs and trends on consumers For example all kinds of moneyworship consumption criticised by public opinion are the influence of vulgar culture The socalled internal factors mainly refer to what kind of spiritual realm and value orientation consumers treat consumption and what they show through consumption is some cultural mentality Marketers interested in global expansion are especially interested in understanding crosscultural differences in purchasing and consumption For instance Ferrari one of the worlds top brands found that Chinese consumers are very different from their Western counterparts Whereas consumers in the US UK and Australia expect to wait 12 months for a custommade Ferrari prospective Chinese buyers want to drive the vehicle off the showroom floor China is an instantgratification market Buyers see their friends riding around in a luxury car and want to have the same as quickly as possible To meet the growing demand for luxury goods Ferrari and other luxury car makers have been forced to modify their production processes for Asian markets Subcultures Subcultures may be based on age geographic religious racial and ethnic differences More often however a subculture occurs when people with shared interests form a looseknit group with a distinctive identity sometimes called consumer tribes Members of subcultures are selfselected and signal their membership status by adopting symbols rituals or behaviours that are widely understood by other members of the tribe eg a dress code hairstyle or even a unique way of speaking For example within youth culture it is possible to identify a number of subgroups with common interests such as skaters and bladers surfers ravers punks skinheads Goths homies and others Generally known as communities as they create a sense of belonging to something important A different type of subculture is a consumption subculture which is based on a shared commitment to a common brand or product In other words consumption subcultures cut across demographic geographic and social boundaries The most wellknown example of a consumption subculture is that of HarleyDavidson motorcycle owners Ethnographic researchers who have studied Harley riders believe that there are only two types of motor cyclists Harley owners and the rest HarleyDavidson has leveraged the values of this subculture by establishing the Harley Owners Group HOG Subcultures are important to marketers for several reasons Firstly given that subcultures can represent sizeable market segments which are profitable and influential there are obvious advantages in developing and selling products and services that meet the needs of subculture members Secondly and perhaps less obviously many new fads and fashions emerge spontaneously from within these tribal groups Trendspotters are accordingly interested in studying the lifestyles and activities of tribes in an effort to spot new trends before they go mainstream Social class Social class refers to relatively homogenous divisions in a society typically based on socioeconomic variables such as educational attainment income and occupation Social class can be very difficult to define and measure however marketers around the world tend to use a conventional classification which divides any given population into five socioeconomic quintiles eg In Australia the groups AB C D E and FG where AB is the top socioeconomic quintile but in much of Asia the quintiles are labelled I II III IV and V where I is the top quintile In Australia for example the AB socioeconomic group account for just 24 of the population but control 50 of discretionary spending The top quintiles ie AB socioeconomic segments are of particular interest to marketers of luxury goods and services such as travel diningout entertainment luxury cars investment or wealth management services upmarket consumer electronics and designer labels eg Louis Vuitton However middleclass consumers tend to consume more carefully in comparison and collect information to compare different producers in the same line Those who are lowerclass consumers tend to buy more on impulse in comparison to the wealthy class who purchases goods to maintain social status Reference groups A reference group is defined as a group whose presumed perspectives or values are being used by an individual as the basis for his or her judgment opinions and actions Reference groups are important because they are used to guide an individuals attitudes beliefs and values Insights into how consumers acquire a given value system can be obtained from an understanding of group influence and group socialisation processes The literature identifies five broad types of reference group primary secondary aspirational dissociative and formal Primary groups groups such as family that exert a strong influence on attitudes and behaviours Secondary groups groups such as clubs societies sports teams political parties religions that align with a persons ideas or values but exert a less fundamental influence on the formation of attitudes and behaviours Aspirational groups groups to which an individual does not currently belong but possibly aspires to become a member because the group possesses characteristics which are admired Disassociative reference groups a group which has a negative image individuals may disapprove of the disassociative groups values attitudes or behaviours and may seek to distance themselves from such groups Opinion Leaders can act like reference groups in that they exert considerable social influence because of their product knowledge expertise and credibility In the marketing literature opinion leaders are also known as influencers mavens and even hubs Opinion leaders are specific to a product category so that an opinion leader for computers is not likely to be an opinion leader for fashion Typically opinion leaders have high levels of involvement with the product category are heavy users of the category and tend to be early adopters of new technologies within the category Journalists celebrities and bloggers are good examples of an opinion leader due to their broad social networks and increased ability to influence peoples decisions Indeed recent evidence suggests that bloggers may be emerging as a more important group of opinion leaders than celebrities In order to leverage the value of opinion leaders in marketing strategies it is important to be able to identify the unique opinion leaders for each category or situation and this can be very challenging Some techniques that can be used are through key informants sociometric techniques and selfquestionnaires More often however marketers use gut instinct to identify opinion leaders For example marketers of athletic shoes have been known to provide gym and aerobic instructors with free shoes in the hope that class members will adopt the same brand as the instructor Marketers of cosmetics and skincare preparations regularly provide fashion editors with free samples in the hope that their products will be mentioned in fashion magazines Influences on consumer purchasing behaviours during the COVID19 pandemic Evidence shows that certain consumer purchasing behaviours rose to prominence during the COVID19 pandemic as result of external and internal factors Namely behaviours such as compulsive buying impulsive buying panic buying and revenge buying where panic buying and revenge buying were most noticeable proved as a coping strategy for alleviating consumers negative responses to the pandemic Panic buying occurs when consumers purchase more things than usual as a consequence of adverse feelings of fear anxiety and uncertainty surrounding a crisis or disruptive event Such purchases tend to be excessive in relation to the perceived threat During the pandemic panic buying of necessities such as food and hygiene products increased across the globe Consider in particular that Australia faced an unprecedented spike in toilet paper sales prompting comments from its Prime Minister Panic buying in response to an irrational fear of scarcity of products and heightened urgency to procure coveted items provided a sense of control for consumers during the pandemic notwithstanding a loss of control to the social professional and health environments around them In addition to panic buying throughout the pandemic revenge buying was apparent during periods when nonessential stores reopened after COVID19related lockdowns Revenge buying was specifically observed in physical luxury retail stores For example it was reported that an Hermes store in Guangzhou China made US27 million in the first day it opened after lockdown where consumers purchases ranged from leather goods scarves and homewares to a diamondstudded Birkin bag among other things The purchase of luxury products where luxury is defined as high quality expensive and nonnecessary is associated with positive emotions often to compensate for negative feelings Namely revenge buying of luxury products provided an emotional release and a sense of belonging esteem and selfactualisation during the COVID19 pandemic in which people were frustrated and psychologically discomforted Such purchases can be said to have achieved sensory gratification as well as problem avoidance for consumers It is clear that consumers sought to obtain internal happiness through consumption as a response to external health crises and social distancing measures Both panic buying and revenge buying were compensatory in nature and therapeutic in nature an attempt for consumers to control an external situation that was out of their internal control as well as provide comfort security and improvement of wellbeing Due to the environmental trends people begin to shop online more to avoid physical stores and stay contactless Customers will spend more on sportswear than on professional dressing in 2020 and technology products related to teleworking such as Zoom also have more consumers than before Besides studies have suggested that after the pandemic peoples awareness of environmental hazards and societys responsibility to save the planet increased so societies changed their shopping behavior during the pandemic People will choose sustainable products even though they cost more In addition stores and brands can adopt sustainable marketing to build a new brand image to attract customers Kannan and Kulkarni also illustrate some phenomena led by the channel migration caused by COVID19 The first phenomenon is that customers are more openminded to trying new brands and products because of the limitation of online channels of certain brands the second phenomenon is that the long time pandemic restrictions make customers who use online channels as substitutes for their offline purchases initially now those customers have learned how to effectively use online channels for their daily lives Consumer decision styles A number of theorists have argued that certain fundamental decisionmaking styles can be identified A decisionmaking style is defined as a mental orientation characterising a consumers approach to making choices Sproles and Kendall 1986 developed a consumer style inventory CSI consisting of eight factors such as pricesensitivity qualityconsciousness brandconsciousness noveltyseeking fashionconsciousness and habit Based on these factors the authors developed a typology of eight distinct decisionmaking styles Quality consciousPerfectionist characterised by a consumers search for the very best quality in products quality conscious consumers tend to shop systematically making more comparisons and shopping around to compare quality and value Brandconscious characterised by a tendency to buy expensive wellknown brands or designer labels Those who score high on brandconsciousness tend to believe that the higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a preference for department stores or toptier retail outlets The concept of Brand Consciousness can be defined as the awareness of the brand and its product offerings that are quite distinctive from the other brands in the market having a competitive advantage The consumers are very concerned about what the brand company thinks about its name and products RecreationconsciousHedonistic characterised by the consumers engagement in the purchase process Those who score high on recreationconsciousness regard shopping itself as a form of enjoyment Priceconscious characterised by priceandvalue consciousness Priceconscious shoppers carefully shop around seeking lower prices sales or discounts and are motivated by obtaining the best value for money Noveltyfashionconscious characterised by a consumers tendency to seek out new products or new experiences for the sake of excitement who gain excitement from seeking new things they like to keep uptodate with fashions and trends Varietyseeking is associated with this dimension Impulsive characterised by carelessness in making purchase decisions spur of the moment purchases and lack of significant concern with expenditure levels or obtaining value Those who score high on impulsive dimensions tend not to be engaged with the object at either a cognitive or emotional level Confused by overchoice characterised by a consumers confusion caused by too many product choices too many stores or an overload of product information A result of information overload Habitualbrand loyal characterised by a consumers tendency to follow a routine purchase pattern on each purchase occasion consumers have favourite brands or stores and have formed habits in choosing so the purchase decision does not involve much evaluation or shopping around The Consumer Styles Inventory CSI has been extensively tested and retested in a wide variety of countries and purchasing contexts Many empirical studies have observed crosscultural variations in decision styles leading to numerous adaptations or modifications of the CSI scale for use in specific countries Consumer decision styles are important for marketers because they describe behaviours that are relatively stable over time and are therefore useful for market segmentation Other topics in consumer behaviour In addition to understanding the purchasing decision marketers are interested in a number of different aspects of consumer behaviour that occur before during and after making a purchase choice Areas of particular interest include risk perception and risk reduction activities brand switching channel switching brand loyalty customer citizenship behaviours and post purchase behavioural intentions and behaviours including brand advocacy referrals word of mouth activity etc Risk perception and risk reduction activities The consumers perceptions of risk are a major consideration in the prepurchase stage of the purchasing decision Perceived risk is defined as the consumers perceptions of the uncertainty and adverse consequences of engaging in an activity Risk consists of two dimensions consequences which refer to the degree of importance or the severity of an outcome and uncertainty which is the consumers subjective assessment of the likelihood of occurrence For example many tourists are fearful of air travel because although the probability of being involved in an airline accident is very low the consequences are potentially dire The marketing literature identifies many different types of risk of which five are the most frequently cited Financial Risk the potential financial loss in the event of a poor decision Performance Risk also known as functional risk the idea that a product or service will not perform as intended Physical Risk the potential for physical harm if something goes wrong with a purchase Social Risk the potential for loss of social status associated with a purchase Psychological Risk the potential for a purchase to result in a loss of selfesteem If a consumer perceives a purchase to be risky they will engage in strategies to reduce the perceived risk until it is within their tolerance levels or if they are unable to do so withdraw from the purchase Thus the consumers perceptions of risk drive information search activities Services marketers have argued that risk perception is higher for services because they lack the search attributes of products ie tangible properties that can be inspected prior to consumption In terms of risk perception marketers and economists identify three broad classes of purchase search goods experience goods and credence goods with implications for consumer evaluation processes Search goods which include most tangible products possess tangible characteristics that allow consumers to evaluate quality prior to purchase and consumption Experience goods such as restaurants and clubs can only be evaluated with certainty after purchase or consumption In the case of credence goods such as many professional services the consumer finds it difficult to fully appreciate the quality of the goods even after purchase and consumption has occurred Difficulties evaluating quality after consumption may arise because the cost of obtaining information is prohibitive or because the consumer lacks the requisite skills and knowledge to undertake such evaluations These goods are called credence products because the consumers quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider Typical riskreduction strategies used include Advertising and Promotional Messages pay closer attention to product or brand related promotion including advertising messages Shopping Around comparing offers and prices inspecting the merchandise Buy Known Brand using a known reputable brand as an indicator of quality merchandise Buy from Reputable Store relying on a reputable retail outlet as an indicator of quality Product Reviews reading independent reviews in main media eg newspapers magazines written by independent experts Online product reviews or consumergenerated testimonials reading about the experiences of other consumers eg TripAdvisor Amazon customer reviews Sampling or Limitedscale Trial where practical obtaining samples free trial or a testdrive prior to purchase Manufacturer Specifications reading information provided by manufacturers eg brochures or specs Referrals obtaining referrals from friends or relatives Sales Representatives talking to sales reps in retail outlets Product Guarantees looking for formal guarantees or warranties New product adoption and diffusion of innovations Within consumer behaviour a particular area of interest is the study of how innovative new products services ideas or technologies spread through groups Insights about how innovations are diffused ie spread through populations can assist marketers to speed up the new product adoption process and finetune the marketing program at different stages of the diffusion process In addition diffusion models provide benchmarks against which new product introductions can be tracked A sizeable body of literature has been devoted to the diffusion of innovation Research studies tend to fall into two broad categories general diffusion research which is an approach that seeks to understand the general process of diffusion and applied diffusion research which consists of studies that describe the diffusion of specific products at particular moments in time or within given social communities Collectively these studies suggest a certain regularity in the adoption process initially few members adopt the innovation but over time successive overlapping waves of people begin to adopt the innovation This pattern contributes to a generalised Sshaped curve as shown in the figure at right However the exact shape and timing of curves varies in different product markets such that some innovations are diffused relatively quickly while others can take many years to achieve broad market acceptance The diffusion model developed by Everett Rogers is widely used in consumer marketing because it segments consumers into five groups based on their rate of new product adoption Rogers defines the diffusion of innovation as the process by which that innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system Thus the diffusion process has a number of elements the innovation the communication channels time and the social system An innovation is any new idea object or process that is perceived as new by members of the social system Communication channels are the means by which information about the innovation is transmitted to members of the social system and may include mass media digital media and personal communications between members of the social system Time refers to the rate at which the innovation is picked up by the members of the social system Table 1 Adopter Categories A number of factors contribute to the rate at which innovations are diffused through a social community Relative advantage the degree to which an innovation is perceived to be superior to alternatives Compatibility the extent to which an innovation fits in with an individuals values lifestyles and past experiences Complexity the degree to which an innovation is perceived to be easy or difficult to understand and use Trialability the extent to which an individual can experiment with the innovation on a limited scale prior to adoption Observability the degree to which the results of the innovation are visible to other members of the social community Innovations with some or all of these factors are more likely to be adopted quickly Accordingly marketing communications may stress the innovations relative benefits over other solutions to the consumers problem Marketing messages may also focus on compatibility and observability Marketers can also facilitate adoption by offering limited scale trial eg samples test drives sale on approval enabling consumers to develop an understanding of the innovation and how it is used prior to purchase Studies have shown that the diffusion rate for many new technologies is speeding up The figure in the Household Penetration of Selected Communications Technologies report illustrates US household penetration rates of selected communications technologies measured as a percentage of all households The slope of the curve becomes steeper with each successive innovation indicating a more rapid diffusion rate For example it took decades for the telephone to achieve 50 percent penetration rates beginning in around 1900 but it took less than five years for cellphones to achieve the same penetration rates In order to explain the increasing pace of adoption some have pointed to supplyside issues such as reduced barriers to entry and lower costs of innovation while others have argued that consumers drive adoption rates because they place a high value on the convenience of new innovations Brandswitching Brandswitching occurs when a consumer chooses to purchase a different brand from their regular or customary brand Consumers switch brands for a variety of reasons including that the store did not have the regular brand or the consumers desire for variety or novelty in brand choice In the fast moving consumer goods market FMCG the incidence of switching is relatively high A great deal of marketing activity is targeted at brandswitchers Rossiter and Bellman have proposed a classification of consumers based on brandloyaltyswitching behaviour Brand Loyals Purchase preferred brand on almost every purchase occasion Favourable Brand Switchers Exhibit moderate preference for the brand or brands that they buy and can be readily enticed to purchase competing brands Other Brand Switchers Normally purchase a competing brand possibly because they are unaware of our brand or due to a negative experience with our brand New Category Users Those who are unaware of a category but have potential to become new users Marketers are particularly interested in understanding the factors that lead to brandswitching A global large sample survey carried out by Nielsen shows that four in 10 shoppers 41 said that getting a better price would encourage them to switch brands or service providerretailer 26 said quality was an incentive to switch 15 looked for a better service agreement and 8 said that improved features are a switching incentive However crosscultural differences were observed among respondents Price was the major switch incentive for more than half of North Americans 61 and Europeans 54 but price and quality held equal sway in AsiaPacific and Middle EastAfrica with roughly onethird of respondents each in both regions reporting that both price and quality were the major incentives to switching The concept of switching costs also known as switching barriers is pertinent to the understanding of brand switching Switching costs refer to the costs incurred by a consumer when they switch from one supplier to another or from one brand to another Although switching costs are often monetary the concept can also refer to psychological costs such as time effort and inconvenience incurred as a result of switching When switching costs are relatively low as in the case of many fast moving consumer goods FMCG the incidence of brand switching tends to be higher An example of switching that includes both monetary and psychological costs is when Android or Apple users wish to switch to a different platform they would need to sacrifice their data including purchased music tracks apps or media and may also need to learn new routines to become an efficient user Channelswitching Channelswitching not to be confused with zapping or channel surfing on TV is the action of consumers switching to a different purchasing environment or distribution channel to purchase goods such as switching from brickandmortar stores to the internet A major reason for this channel switching behaviour is the convenience that online shopping provides for consumers Consumers can shop online at any hour of the day without having to drive travel or walk to a physical store and browse for as little or as much time as they please The additional lure of online only deals and discounts helps enforce a consumers preference to shop online Other factors for this shift are the globalisation of markets the advent of category killers such as Officeworks and Kids R Us as well as changes in the legal regulatory environment For instance in Australia and New Zealand following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies For the consumer channel switching offers a more diverse shopping experience However marketers need to be alert to channel switching because of its potential to erode market share Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper when superior models become available when a wider range is offered or simply because it is more convenient to shop through a different channel eg online or onestop shopping As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour some retailers engage in multichannel retailing Impulse buying According to 1962 research from Hawkins Stern impulse purchases fall into four categories including pure impulse buying reminded impulse buying suggestion impulse buying and planned impulse buying While pure impulse buying involves a customer experiencing strong desire for a product they didnt initially plan to buy reminded impulse buying occurs when a buyer remembers a need for a product by seeing it in a store Suggestion impulse buying occurs when a consumer sees a product that they have no prior knowledge about envisions a use for it and decides that they need it and planned impulse buying happens when a consumers purchasing plan changes while shopping 2013 research carried out by Nielsen International suggests that about 72 percent of FMCG purchases are planned but that 28 percent of supermarket purchases are unplanned or impulse purchases The top unplanned purchases in the food category are candy lollies chocolate cookies biscuits frozen desserts and snacks and the top unplanned purchases in the nonfood category are cosmetics airfresheners toothbrushes handsoaps and handbody lotions This explains why supermarkets place these types of products at the front of the store or near the checkout where the consumer spends more time and is more likely to notice them and therefore more likely to pop them into the shopping basket Retailers use insights from this type of research to design stores in ways that maximise opportunities for impulsebuying Affect Emotions feelings and mood The consumers affective state has implications for a number of different dimensions of consumer behaviour including information search evaluation of alternatives product choice service encounters complaining and advertising responses Westbrook 1987 p 259 defines affect as a class of mental phenomena uniquely characterised by a consciously experienced subjective feeling state commonly accompanying emotions and moods Research suggests that affect plays an important role in underlying attitudes as well as shaping evaluation and decisionmaking Consumer researchers have noted the difficulties separating the concepts of affect emotions feelings and mood The line between emotions and mood is difficult to draw and consumer researchers often use the concepts interchangeably Yet other researchers note that a detailed understanding of the relationship between affect and consumer behaviour has been hampered by the lack of research in the area Indeed within the consumer behaviour literature there is widespread agreement that the role of emotions is an area that is currently underresearched and is in need of greater attention both theoretically and empirically Information search Studies have found that people in a positive mood are more efficient at information search activities That is they are more efficient at processing information are able to integrate information by identifying useful relationships and arrive at creative solutions to problems Due to their efficiency processing information those who are in a positive mood are generally quicker to make decisions and easier to please Research consistently shows that people in a positive mood are more likely to evaluate information positively As online environments become more important as a consumer search tool it may be prudent for web designers to consider sitedesign issues such as ease of navigation lest poor design contribute to customer frustration thereby engendering a bad mood and ultimately leading to unfavourable productbrand evaluations Choice Affect may play an important role in impulsebuying decisions Research suggests that consumers place higher weightings on immediate affective rewards and punishments while delayed rewards receive less weighting For instance the immediate pleasure of eating a sweet treat often outweighs the longer term benefits of eating a healthy alternative such as fruit This occurs because the immediate emotional gain is a strong driver and one that consumers can readily visualise whereas the more distant goal lacks sufficient strength to drive choice Customer experience Customers who are in a bad mood are more difficult to please They are slower to process information and consequently take longer to make decisions They tend to be more argumentative and are more likely to complain Customer satisfaction The relationship between affect and customer satisfaction is an area that has received considerable academic attention especially in the services marketing literature The proposition that there is a positive relationship between affect and satisfaction is well supported in the literature In a metaanalysis of the empirical evidence carried out in 2001 Szymanski et al suggest that affect may be both an antecedent to and an outcome of satisfaction Emotions elicited during consumption are proposed to leave affective traces in memory that are available for consumers to access and integrate into their satisfaction assessments A 2011 metaanalysis illustrates how both repurchase intent and loyalty enjoy a strong positive relationship 054 with customer satisfaction Another metaanalysis finds that The results indicate that both cognitiverelated variables including brand awareness brand personality and brand identity and hedonicrelated variables including hedonic attitude entertainment and aesthetic appeal have significant impacts on quality and value perceptions towards the brand including perceived quality reputation brand image perceived value commitment and trust In addition these variables are all significant predictors of brand loyalty A third metaanalysis from 2013 elaborates on the concept of brand personality bp First the key drivers of BP are communication with hedonic benefit claims branding activities a brands countryoforigin and consumer personalities Second the study finds that the effects of BP are stronger for mature brands than for brands in the early life cycle stages Third sincerity and competence have the strongest influence on brand success variables eg brand attitude image commitment purchase intention while excitement and ruggedness have the weakest influence on brand attitude and brand commitment Advertising Emotion can play an important role in advertising In advertising two different approaches to persuasion are common a thinking ads that require cognitive processing also known as the central route to persuasion and b feeling ads that are processed at an emotional level also known as the peripheral route Advertisers can bypass cognitive rational processing which can lead to counterarguing by simply appealing to the emotions Neuroimaging studies suggest that when evaluating brands consumers primarily use emotions personal feelings and experiences rather than information brand attributes features and facts It is relatively widely accepted that emotional responses require fewer processing resources ie are easier and also result in more enduring associations with the brand being advertised Feelings elicited by the advertising message can shape attitudes towards the brand and to the advertisement Customer loyalty Customer loyalty defined as the relationship between an individuals relative attitude and repeat patronage Dick and Basu 1994 p 99 Thus by definition loyalty has both an attitudinal component and a behavioural component Dick and Basu proposed four types of loyalty based on relative attitude and patronage behaviour No Loyalty Characterised by low relative attitude and low repeat patronage behaviour May occur when competing brands are seen as similar or in the case of new brands or categories where insufficient time has elapsed for loyalty to become established Spurious Loyalty Characterised by low relative attitude and high repeat patronage Spurious loyalty occurs when the consumer undertakes repeat purchasing due to situational factors such as access convenience or shelf placement Spurious loyalty can also occur when there are no genuine alternatives or the consumer is lockedin to purchasing a given brand due to some quasicontractual arrangement or membership status which creates difficulties for switching In other words where switching costs are relatively high high patronage behaviour may be observed despite the absence of a favourable attitude towards the brand An example would be a consumer who always purchases petrol from the same outlet on the way to work because there are no other outlets in the vicinity Latent Loyalty Characterised by high relative attitude and low repeat patronage Latent loyalty occurs when situational factors override strong favourable attitudes For example a person may have a preferred restaurant but may not patronise it due to the preferences of dining companions Loyalty ie true loyalty Characterised by favourable attitude and favourable patronage behaviour For marketers true loyalty is the ideal situation Loyalty marketing programs are built on the insight that it costs 520 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing customer Marketers use a variety of loyalty programs to strengthen customer attitudes towards the brand or service providerretailer in order to retain customers minimise customer defections and strengthen loyalty bonds with existing customers Broadly there are two types of program reward and recognition programs In a Reward Program the customer accumulates points for each purchase and the points can subsequently be exchanged for goods or services Recognition Programs operate on a quasimembership basis where the consumer is issued with a card that upon presentation leads to various entitlements such as free upgrades special privileges or access to productsservices that are not normally available to non members and that acknowledge the loyal customers VIP status For example a hotel might recognise loyal patrons by providing a complimentary fruit bowl and bottle of champagne in the room on arrival Whereas reward programs are motivated by the consumers desire for material possessions recognition programs are motivated by the consumers need for esteem recognition and status Many commercial loyalty programs are hybrid schemes combining elements of both reward and recognition In addition not all reward programs are designed to encourage loyalty Certain reward programs are designed to encourage other types of positive customer behaviour such as the provision of referrals or providing positive wordofmouth WOM recommendations Loyalty marketing can involve the use of databases and sophisticated software to analyse and profile customer loyalty segments with a view to identifying the most desirable segments setting goals for each segment and ultimately attempting to increase the size of the loyal customer base Customer citizenship behaviour Customer citizenship behaviour is the labor that customers do for brands out of loyalty The services marketing literature identifies seven distinct types of citizenship behaviour voice when customers direct their complaint to the service provider in order to rectify and maintain the relationship display of affiliation policing the observation of other customers to ensure their appropriate behaviour flexibility service improvement providing ideas and suggestions for organisations wordofmouth referrals and benevolent acts of service Internet consumer behaviour Traditional models of consumer behaviour were developed by scholars such as Fishbein and Ajzen and Howard and Sheth in the 1960s and 70s More recently Shun and Yunjie have argued that online consumer behaviour is different to offline behaviour and as a consequence requires new theories or models After COVID19 online consumer behaviour seems more essential because since COVID19 began there were about 31 more people started shopping online with 43 of all respondents compared to only 12 of respondents before COVID19 Research has identified two types of consumer value in purchasing namely product value and shopping value Product value is likely to be similar for both online and offline shoppers However the shopping experience will be substantially different for online shoppers In an offline shopping environment consumers derive satisfaction from being within the physical store environment or retail landscape hedonic motivations In the case of online purchasing shoppers derive satisfaction from their ability to navigate a website and the convenience of online searching which allows them to compare prices and shop around with minimal time commitment Thus the online consumer is motivated by more utilitarian factors Different types of online behaviour Consumers may use online platforms for various stages of the purchase decision Some consumers use online sources simply to acquire information about planned purchases Others use online platforms for making the actual purchase In other situations consumers may also use online platforms to engage in postpurchase behaviours such as staying connected with a brand by joining a brand community Or they may become a brand advocate by posting a product review online or providing brand referrals via social media Some ecommerce providers have encountered a challenge in courting consumers who seek information online but still prefer to turn to bricks and mortar retailers for their purchase To understand the needs and habits of these and other kinds of online shoppers online marketers have segmented consumers into different kinds of online behaviour in accordance with their online behavioural characteristics Lewis and Lewis 1997 identified five market segments based on the way that consumers use the Internet in the purchase decision process Directed Informationseekers are users that primarily look for information about a product or service online but there is no guarantee that they may be converted into online buyers Undirected Informationseekers are newcomers to a product or service They are more likely to interact with online prompts and click through to web pages linked in advertising Directed Buyers have a predetermined mindset and wish to purchase a specific product or service online Bargain Hunters are pricesensitive users that like to discover products during sales promotions For these users discounts are a major attraction to online sales conversion Entertainment Seekers are online consumers that are attracted to marketing delivered as a fun activity Interactive online games could be useful in attracting this kind of customer A typology of online consumer behaviour Wendy Moe 2003 argues that in the offline environment consumers who are shopping in stores can be easily classified by experienced sales employees only by watching their shopping behaviours Such classification may not appear online but Moe and Fader argued that it is feasible to predict practical buying surfing and searching action online by investigating click patterns and repetition of visit within online behaviour In addition a report of Econsultancy about benchmarking of user experience outlined three kinds of online consuming behaviour as a valuable classification for the research of design of web pages to better serve different kinds of consuming behaviour The three categories are trackers hunters and explorers Trackers are the online consumers who are exactly looking for a product that they definitely wish to buy They use the Internet for the information about its price delivery methods postpurchase service and so on Once they have found the proper information little effort is needed to let them do the business Hunters just know the categories of the product that they need for instance a novel for leisure time However they have not made specific decision on whose novel to buy They use the Internet to find a list of product of their needed categories to make comparison This kind of online consumer needs advice and help to do their business Explorers do not even have the categories of product on their minds In fact they just want to buy something online There is more uncertainty of this type of online consumers Influence of the Internet on buying process As the preceding table shows the first row indicates the process of a consumer buying a new product while the second and third row illustrates the positive influences the Internet could have on buying process by creating effective communications with online consumers For example suppose a consumer carelessly sees an advertisement about laptops on Wechat a popular Chinese social media developed by Tencent He begins to feel that his laptop is a bit out of date and wants to buy a new one which is the outcome of good advertisement placed on a daily Internet tool He does not know anything about how to buy a new one as business changes so fast today so he searches on Google to find an answer On the results page he finds promotional ads which mainly come from JDcom and Taobao two competing Chinese online retailers in this field He prefers to use JDcom which provides detailed comparisons of brands prices locations and methods of payment and delivery After careful selection he makes his order through JDcom via Wechat payment JDcom has one of the fastest distribution channels within China and it supports excellent postpurchase service to maintain its position in the market The role of aesthetics and visual fluency in relation to consumer choice Consumers decide whether or not they like a product within 90 seconds of viewing it for the first time Therefore having an aesthetically pleasing product is essential in the marketplace Studies in processing fluency and consumer behaviour have revealed that that people prefer visual displays that are easier to process and understand and When a product matches the users associations with it it is perceived as more attractive Visually fluent products draw upon consumers preexisting associations with their design elements leading to a sense of familiarity and understanding with the product at hand Visual cues such as colour composition typography and imagery are associated with the phenomenon of fluency Colour Research in colour psychology has shown 6290 of consumer product assessment is based on colour alone Indeed colours have been shown to be linked to consumers perceptions on a products quality reliability and value The colours blue and black are viewed as being more reliable valuable and expensive while yellow orange and brown are associated with cheapness and low quality Therefore a product intended to be perceived as high quality with a predominately orange and brown palette would lack visual fluency and would likely fail to elicit a positive response with consumers However this can be advantageous if the consumer is already in the market for an item that is known to be inexpensive in which case the use of yellow orange or brown would be appropriate Colour can also be used to signal brand personality Composition Composition is another visual tool that has the ability to affect information processing and influence in consumer perceptions Studies have shown that consumers in western countries will associate products that are right aligned or placed on the right side of a display to be higher quality Humans also have a center bias which makes products that are centered or symmetrical in composition or display seem intrinsically more pleasing Products that are centered in composition or have centered elements are perceived as being more attractive popular and important than products that are left aligned or right aligned When an object is centered compositionally it easier for a viewer to interpret and understand It becomes more fluent and is therefore viewed as being more aesthetically pleasing Imagery Evidence has shown that pictorial imagery correlates to higher instances of consumer recall and recognition Pictorial imagery is also easier to process and gains consumers attention faster There is significant evidence that when consumers are presented with multiple choices they will view objects more positively and more aesthetically pleasing when surrounded by congruent imagery After repeated exposure this familiar imagery becomes incorporated into consumers visual lexicon and they become fluent in it Images with higher levels of visual fluency perceived as being more familiar likeable and friendly and are therefore more likely to be chosen by consumers Typographic elements Although studies have shown that of pictorial imagery is easier for consumers to process and understand the choice of typography remains an indispensable element of product design Handwritten and scripted fonts are associated with individuality femininity and luxury while sans serif fonts embody energy cleanliness and modernity Font size has also been shown to have a direct correlation on the emotional attributes assigned to a product One study has shown that larger type size and weight is perceived as more intimidating and authoritative Although imagery reigns supreme in product design type is processed just as easily as pictorial information when the consumer is already familiar with the product Environmental impact An aspect of Individual action on climate change is consumer behaviour that affects how much and what kinds of materials are used to produce goods and food how much material is recycled or composted how much ends up as pollution how much ends up in landfills where goods are produced how far they travel and the carbon footprint of manufacturing transportation and disposal Green marketing targets consumers who take the environmental impact of their purchases into account One 2017 study found no impact of green marketing on consumer behaviour in Bangladesh The study suggests policies be made that decrease the cost of ecofriendly products It also encourages the implementation of programs which raise consumer awareness regarding the issue of green consumption There are psychological factors which contribute to a consumers perception surrounding their personal contributions to climate change inducing actions One of the more well studied biases is referred to as the betterthanaverage or selfenhancing bias This bias depicts an individuals tendency to perceive that their actions are superior especially when compared to peers or demographically similar consumers It has been found that this cognitive bias is indeed present when considering how consumers perceive their proenvironmental efforts This may be a result of information about climate change leading to feelings of guilt and concern which activates an unconscious thought process denial the betterthanaverage effect and other cognitive reactions that leads to a reduced perception of the threat of climate change It is a mental defense mechanism that ultimately leads to a reduction in perceived individual responsibility to take part in green behaviours and oneplanetliving Research methods used To gain insights into consumer behaviour researchers uses the standard battery of market research methods such as surveys depth interviews and focus groups Increasingly researchers are turning to newer methodologies and technologies in an effort to seek deeper understandings of why consumers behave in certain ways These newer methods include ethnographic research also known as participant observation and neuroscience as well as experimental lab designs In addition researchers often turn to separate disciplines for insights with potential to inform the study of consumer behaviour For instance behavioural economics is adding new insights into certain aspects of consumer behaviour Ethnographic research Ethnographic research or ethnography has its origins in anthropology However marketers use ethnographic research to study the consumer in terms of cultural trends lifestyle factors attitudes and the way that social context influences product selection consumption and usage Ethnographic research also called participant observation attempts to study consumer behaviour in natural settings rather than in artificial environment such as labs Different types of ethnographic research are used in marketing including Observed product usage observing regular product usage at home or work to gain insights into how products are opened prepared consumed stored disposed etc to gain insights into the usefulness of packaging labelling and general usage Dayinthelife studies extended visits during product usage situations to gain insights into norms and consumer expectations Accompanied purchase or shopalongs researcher accompanies a shopper on a purchase expedition to gain insights into consumer responses to merchandising and other sales tactics Cultural studies similar to traditional ethnography extended stays with a group or tribe with a view to uncovering the fundamental rules and conventions that govern behaviour Guerilla ethnography random observations in public settings to help establish research questions or to gain quick insights into specific behaviours Mystery shopping observations in the retail context with a view to gaining insights into the customers service experience Multiple methodologies combining ethnographic research methods with conventional research techniques with a view to triangulating results Trendspotters such as Faith Popcorns BrainReserve make extensive use of ethnographic research to spot emergent trends Consumer neuroscience Consumer neuroscience also known as neuromarketing refers to the commercial use of neuroscience when applied to the investigation of marketing problems and consumer research Some researchers have argued that the term consumer neuroscience is preferred over neuromarketing or other alternatives Consumer neuroscience employs sophisticated biometric sensors such as electroencephalography EEG functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and eye tracking to study the ways that consumers respond to specific stimuli such as product displays brands packaging information or other marketing signals Such tests reveal stimuli that trigger the brains pleasure centre Consumer neuroscience has become a mainstream component of consumer research methods International market research company Nielsen Research has recently added neuromarketing to its services by acquiring Innerscope a company specialising in neuromarketing research thus enabling Nielsen to add neuromarketing research to the suite of services available to clients Consumer neuroscience research has led to some surprising findings Framing price or value For example one study reported on a magazine subscription where potential subscribers were offered two options an online subscription for 59 or a combined online and print for 129 a year Most people chose the online only option However when a third option was introduced print only for 129 ie the decoy the online and print option seemed like better value and a significant number of people switched to that option In other words the decoy price assists in framing value Marketers use a variety of methods to frame value eg quote monthly payment options rather than a single allinclusive price Choice fatigue Research by Sheena Iyengar experimented with the number of gourmet jams on display When consumers were faced with a large number of alternatives 24 jams 60 of consumers stopped and looked but only a few 3 actually made a purchase However when consumers faced with fewer brands 6 jams were more likely to make a purchase with 30 going on to buy something Similar results have been observed in other categories The findings suggest that while consumers appreciate being given some choice the process of making a selection is painful and can lead to choice fatigue An issue for marketers and retailers is to determine the sweet spot where consumers are given sufficient choice to satisfy their desire for variety but not become overwhelmed by it Decision paralysis One study examined the wording used to solicit philanthropic donations Consumers were exposed to variants in the advertising copy execution Would you be willing to help by giving a donation and Would you be willing to help by giving a donation Every penny will help Those given the second option were almost twice as likely to donate The researchers concluded that people are more likely to take action when given parameters By clarifying that even a penny could make a difference the second line provides guidance and makes the request more achievable For marketers the implication is that when asking consumers to take an action specifying a small step helps to break through the action paralysis This finding also suggests that even small differences in advertising copy can lead to improved outcomes Action instructions will make the advertisement more purposeful See also References Further reading Blackwell Miniard and Engel 2006 Consumer Behaviour 10th Ed Thomson Learning Deaton Angus Muellbauer John Economics and

mondialisation developed its current meaning sometime in the second half of the 20th century and came into popular use in the 1990s to describe the unprecedented international connectivity of the postCold War world Its origins can be traced back to 18th and 19th centuries due to advances in transportation and communications technology This increase in global interactions has caused a growth in international trade and the exchange of ideas beliefs and culture Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that is associated with social and cultural aspects However disputes and international diplomacy are also large parts of the history of globalization and of modern globalization Economically globalization involves goods services data technology and the economic resources of capital The expansion of global markets liberalizes the economic activities of the exchange of goods and funds Removal of crossborder trade barriers has made the formation of global markets more feasible Advances in transportation like the steam locomotive steamship jet engine and container ships and developments in telecommunication infrastructure such as the telegraph the Internet mobile phones and smartphones have been major factors in globalization and have generated further interdependence of economic and cultural activities around the globe Though many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times others trace its history to long before the European Age of Discovery and voyages to the New World and some even to the third millennium BCE Largescale globalization began in the 1820s and in the late 19th century and early 20th century drove a rapid expansion in the connectivity of the worlds economies and cultures The term global city was subsequently popularized by sociologist Saskia Sassen in her work The Global City New York London Tokyo 1991 In 2000 the International Monetary Fund IMF identified four basic aspects of globalization trade and transactions capital and investment movements migration and movement of people and the dissemination of knowledge Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization economics sociocultural resources and the natural environment Academic literature commonly divides globalization into three major areas economic globalization cultural globalization and political globalization Proponents of globalization point to economic growth and broader societal development as benefits while opponents claim globalizing processes are detrimental to social wellbeing due to ethnocentrism environmental consequences and other potential drawbacks Between 1990 and 2010 globalisation progressed rapidly driven by the information and communication technology revolution that lowered communication costs along with trade liberalisation and the shift of manufacturing operations to emerging economies particularly China Etymology and usage The word globalization was used in the English language as early as the 1930s but only in the context of education and the term failed to gain traction Over the next few decades the term was occasionally used by other scholars and media but it was not clearly defined One of the first usages of the term in the meaning resembling the later was by French economist Franois Perroux in his essays from the early 1960s in his French works he used the term mondialisation literarly worldization in French also translated as mundialization Theodore Levitt is often credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later in the middle of 1980s Though often treated as synonyms in French globalization is seen as a stage following mondialisation a stage that implies the dissolution of national identities and the abolishment of borders inside the world network of economic exchanges Since its inception the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and empire across Asia and the Indian Ocean from the 15th century onward In 1848 Karl Marx noticed the increasing level of national interdependence brought on by capitalism and predicted the universal character of the modern world society He states The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country To the great chagrin of Reactionists it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood All oldestablished national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed In place of the old local and national seclusion and selfsufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations Sociologists Martin Albrow and Elizabeth King define globalization as all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society In The Consequences of Modernity Anthony Giddens writes Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa In 1992 Roland Robertson professor of sociology at the University of Aberdeen and an early writer in the field described globalization as the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole In Global Transformations David Held and his cowriters state Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening deepening and speeding up of global interconnection such a definition begs further elaboration Globalization can be on a continuum with the local national and regional At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local andor national basis at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions Globalization can refer to those spatialtemporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents Without reference to such expansive spatial connections there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements extensity stretching intensity velocity and impact Held and his cowriters definition of globalization in that same book as transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactionsassessed in terms of their extensity intensity velocity and impactgenerating transcontinental or interregional flows was called probably the most widelycited definition in the 2014 DHL Global Connectiveness Index Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson in his book The Race to the Top The Real Story of Globalization states that globalization is the process of world shrinkage of distances getting shorter things moving closer It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact to mutual benefit with somebody on the other side of the world Paul James defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis Globalization is the extension of social relations across worldspace defining that worldspace in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing worldtime Manfred Steger professor of global studies and research leader in the Global Cities Institute at RMIT University identifies four main empirical dimensions of globalization economic political cultural and ecological A fifth dimensionthe ideologicalcutting across the other four The ideological dimension according to Steger is filled with a range of norms claims beliefs and narratives about the phenomenon itself James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of communities of practice Wenger 1998 academics journalists publisherseditors and librarians 424 They note the term was used in education to describe the global life of the mind in international relations to describe the extension of the European Common Market and in journalism to describe how the American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance They have also argued that four forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions According to James the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization the movement of people A second form is agencyextended globalization the circulation of agents of different institutions organizations and polities including imperial agents Objectextended globalization a third form is the movement of commodities and other objects of exchange He calls the transmission of ideas images knowledge and information across worldspace disembodied globalization maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how today the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of refugees and migrants are increasingly restricted while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most deregulated The journalist Thomas L Friedman popularized the term flat world arguing that globalized trade outsourcing supplychaining and political forces had permanently changed the world for better and worse He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow Economist Takis Fotopoulos defined economic globalization as the opening and deregulation of commodity capital and labor markets that led toward present neoliberal globalization He used political globalization to refer to the emergence of a transnational lite and a phasing out of the nationstate Meanwhile he used cultural globalization to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture Other of his usages included ideological globalization technological globalization and social globalization Lechner and Boli 2012 define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways Globophobia is used to refer to the fear of globalization though it can also mean the fear of balloons History There are both distal and proximate causes which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization Largescale globalization began in the 19th century Archaic Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest civilizations until roughly the 1600s This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and states and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels In this schema three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur The first is the idea of Eastern Origins which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia North Africa the Middle East and certain parts of Europe With early globalization it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not close Eventually technological advances allowed states to learn of others existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur The third has to do with interdependency stability and regularity If a state is not dependent on another then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade without either globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to work This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today Also posited is a multipolar nature to archaic globalization which involved the active participation of nonEuropeans Because it predated the Great Divergence in the nineteenth century where Western Europe pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of industrial production and economic output archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed Old World centers such as Gujarat Bengal coastal China and Japan The German historical economist and sociologist Andre Gunder Frank argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between Sumer and the Indus Valley civilization in the third millennium BCE This archaic globalization existed during the Hellenistic Age when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of Greek culture that reached from India to Spain including Alexandria and the other Alexandrine cities Early on the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of importing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted the state controlled only the supply of grain Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China the Indian subcontinent Persia Europe and Arabia opening longdistance political and economic interactions between them Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well and religions syncretic philosophies and various technologies as well as diseases also traveled along the Silk Routes In addition to economic trade the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network The movement of people such as refugees artists craftsmen missionaries robbers and envoys resulted in the exchange of religions art languages and new technologies From around 3000 BCE to 1000 CE connectivity within AfroEurasia was centered upon the IndoMediterranean region with the Silk Road later rising in importance with the Mongol Empires consolidation of Asia in the 13th century Early modern Early modern or protoglobalization covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800 The concept of protoglobalization was first introduced by historians A G Hopkins and Christopher Bayly The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high modern globalization in the late 19th century This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires in the 15th and 17th centuries first the Portuguese Empire 1415 followed by the Spanish Empire 1492 and later the Dutch and British Empires In the 17th century world trade developed further when chartered companies like the British East India Company founded in 1600 and the Dutch East India Company founded in 1602 often described as the first multinational corporation in which stock was offered were established An alternative view from historians Dennis Flynn and Arturo Giraldez postulated that globalization began with the first circumnavigation of the globe under the MagellanElcano expedition which preluded the rise of global silver trade Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of expansionism the method of managing global trade and the level of information exchange The period is marked by the shift of hegemony to Western Europe the rise of largerscale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Years War and demand for commodities most particularly slaves The triangular trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the Western Hemisphere The transfer of animal stocks plant crops and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred W Crosbys concept of the Columbian exchange also played a central role in this process European Middle Eastern Indian Southeast Asian and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications particularly in the Indian Ocean region Modern According to economic historians Kevin H ORourke Leandro Prados de la Escosura and Guillaume Daudin several factors promoted globalization in the period 18151870 The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries During the 19th century globalization approached its form as a direct result of the Industrial Revolution Industrialization allowed standardized production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities In the 19th century steamships reduced the cost of international transportation significantly and railroads made inland transportation cheaper The transportation revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850 More nations embraced international trade Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenthcentury imperialism such as in Africa and Asia Contemporary After World War II work by politicians led to the agreements of the Bretton Woods Conference in which major governments laid down the framework for international monetary policy commerce and finance and the founding of several international institutions intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering trade barriers Initially the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions GATTs successor was the World Trade Organization WTO which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process Exports nearly doubled from 85 of total gross world product in 1970 to 162 in 2001 The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiation Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements such as the 2011 United StatesKorea Free Trade Agreement The invention of shipping containers in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce Since the 1970s aviation has become increasingly affordable to middle classes in developed countries Open skies policies and lowcost carriers have helped to bring competition to the market In the 1990s the growth of lowcost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between countries More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location This included accounting software development and engineering design Student exchange programs became popular after World War II and are intended to increase the participants understanding and tolerance of other cultures as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times Since the 1980s modern globalization has spread rapidly through the expansion of capitalism and neoliberal ideologies The implementation of neoliberal policies has allowed for the privatization of public industry deregulation of laws or policies that interfered with the free flow of the market as well as cutbacks to governmental social services These neoliberal policies were introduced to many developing countries in the form of structural adjustment programs SAPs that were implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF These programs required that the country receiving monetary aid would open its markets to capitalism privatize public industry allow free trade cut social services like healthcare and education and allow the free movement of giant multinational corporations These programs allowed the World Bank and the IMF to become global financial market regulators that would promote neoliberalism and the creation of free markets for multinational corporations on a global scale In the late 19th and early 20th century the connectedness of the worlds economies and cultures grew very quickly This slowed down from the 1910s onward due to the World Wars and the Cold War but picked up again in the 1980s and 1990s The revolutions of 1989 and subsequent liberalization in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process In the period between 1965 and 1990 the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled Most migration occurred between the developing countries and least developed countries LDCs As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold Wars division of the world it also left the United States its sole policeman and an unfettered advocate of free market It also resulted in the growing prominence of attention focused on the movement of diseases the proliferation of popular culture and consumer values the growing prominence of international institutions like the UN and concerted international action on such issues as the environment and human rights Other developments as dramatic were the Internets becoming influential in connecting people across the world As of June 2012 more than 24 billion peopleover a third of the worlds human populationhave used the services of the Internet Growth of globalization has never been smooth One influential event was the late 2000s recession which was associated with lower growth in areas such as crossborder phone calls and Skype usage or even temporarily negative growth in areas such as trade of global interconnectedness The ChinaUnited States trade war starting in 2018 negatively affected trade between the two largest national economies The economic impact of the COVID19 pandemic included a massive decline in tourism and international business travel as many countries temporarily closed borders The 20212022 global supply chain crisis resulted from temporary shutdowns of manufacturing and transportation facilities and labor shortages Supply problems incentivized some switches to domestic production The economic impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine included a blockade of Ukrainian ports and international sanctions on Russia resulting in some decoupling of the Russian economy with global trade especially with the European Union and other Western countries Modern consensus for the last 15 years regards globalization as having run its course and gone into decline A common argument for this is that trade has dropped since its peak in 2008 and never recovered since the Great Recession New opposing views from some economists have argued such trends are a result of price drops and in actuality trade volume is increasing especially with agricultural products natural resources and refined petroleum The 21st century melting of the Arctic will also affect global trade as it is paving the way for shorter trade routes Economic globalization Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in crossborder movement of goods services technology and capital Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs taxes and other impediments that suppresses global trade economic globalization is the process of increasing economic integration between countries leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market Depending on the paradigm economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon Economic globalization comprises globalization of production which refers to the obtainment of goods and services from a particular source from locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality Likewise it also comprises globalization of markets which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace Economic globalization also includes competition technology and corporations and industries Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of foreign direct investment the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms and in many cases immigration International standards have made trade in goods and services more efficient An example of such standard is the intermodal container Containerization dramatically reduced the costs of transportation supported the postwar boom in international trade and was a major element in globalization International standards are set by the International Organization for Standardization which is composed of representatives from various national standards organizations A multinational corporation or worldwide enterprise is an organization that owns or controls the production of goods or services in one or more countries other than their home country It can also be referred to as an international corporation a transnational corporation or a stateless corporation A freetrade area is the region encompassing a trade bloc whose member countries have signed a freetrade agreement FTA Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers import quotas and tariffs and to increase trade of goods and services with each other If people are also free to move between the countries in addition to a freetrade agreement it would also be considered an open border Arguably the most significant freetrade area in the world is the European Union a politicoeconomic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe The EU has developed European Single Market through a standardized system of laws that apply in all member states EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people goods services and capital within the internal market Trade facilitation looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximize efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives Global trade in services is also significant For example in India business process outsourcing has been described as the primary engine of the countrys development over the next few decades contributing broadly to GDP growth employment growth and poverty alleviation William I Robinsons theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallersteins World Systems Theory He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities One important aspect of Robinsons globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six countries each contributing to a part of the production process Cultural globalization Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas meanings and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet popular culture media and international travel This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures Crosscultural communication is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate in similar and different ways among themselves and how they endeavor to communicate across cultures Intercultural communication is a related field of study Cultural diffusion is the spread of cultural itemssuch as ideas styles religions technologies languages etc Cultural globalization has increased crosscultural contacts but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of onceisolated communities For example sushi is available in Germany as well as Japan but EuroDisney outdraws the city of Paris potentially reducing demand for authentic French pastry Globalizations contribution to the alienation of individuals from their traditions may be modest compared to the impact of modernity itself as alleged by existentialists such as JeanPaul Sartre and Albert Camus Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture particularly via the Internet and satellite television The cultural diffusion can create a homogenizing force where globalization is seen as synonymous with homogenizing force via connectedness of markets cultures politics and the desire for modernizations through imperial countries sphere of influence Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize being spread by force migration evangelists imperialists and traders Christianity Islam Buddhism and more recently sects such as Mormonism are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins Globalization has strongly influenced sports For example the modern Olympic Games has athletes from more than 200 nations participating in a variety of competitions The FIFA World Cup is the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world exceeding even the Olympic Games a ninth of the entire population of the planet watched the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final The term globalization implies transformation Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage Archivists may attempt to collect record or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified while local musicians may struggle for authenticity and to preserve local musical traditions Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization Music genres such as jazz and reggae began locally and later became international phenomena Globalization gave support to the world music phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences Though the term World Music was originally intended for ethnicspecific music globalization is now expanding its scope such that the term often includes hybrid subgenres such as world fusion global fusion ethnic fusion and worldbeat Bourdieu claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as selfidentification and the formation of identity Musically this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture as this is the most basic cause for a persons wants and behavior The concept of ones own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization Also globalization has increased the interdependency of political personal cultural and economic factors A 2005 UNESCO report showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods In 2002 China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods after the UK and US Between 1994 and 2002 both North Americas and the European Unions shares of cultural exports declined while Asias cultural exports grew to surpass North America Related factors are the fact that Asias population and area are several times that of North America Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of Americas shops markets and objects being brought into other countries Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures As a dominating countrys culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to Westernization or Americanization of culture where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures Globalization is a diverse phenomenon that relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries The Indian experience particularly reveals the plurality of the impact of cultural globalization Transculturalism is defined as seeing oneself in the other Transcultural is in turn described as extending through all human cultures or involving encompassing or combining elements of more than one culture Children brought up in transcultural backgrounds are sometimes called thirdculture kids Political globalization Political globalization refers to the growth of the worldwide political system both in size and complexity That system includes national governments their governmental and intergovernmental organizations as well as governmentindependent elements of global civil society such as international nongovernmental organizations and social movement organizations One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the nationstate and the rise of other actors on the political scene William R Thompson has defined it as the expansion of a global political system and its institutions in which interregional transactions including but certainly not limited to trade are managed Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature with the two other being economic globalization and cultural globalization Intergovernmentalism is a term in political science with two meanings The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by Stanley Hoffmann the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration Multilevel governance is an approach in political science and public administration theory that originated from studies on European integration Multilevel governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority Some people are citizens of multiple nationstates Multiple citizenship also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or dual nationality is a persons citizenship status in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one state under the laws of those states Increasingly nongovernmental organizations influence public policy across national boundaries including humanitarian aid and developmental efforts Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts charities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Accion International the Acumen Fund now Acumen and the Echoing Green have combined the business model with philanthropy giving rise to business organizations such as the Global Philanthropy Group and new associations of philanthropists such as the Global Philanthropy Forum The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibilliondollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the worlds more impoverished but rapidly growing countries The Hudson Institute estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at US59 billion in 2010 As a response to globalization some countries have embraced isolationist policies For example the North Korean government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter Citizens cannot freely leave the country Globalization and gender Globalization has been a gendered process where giant multinational corporations have outsourced jobs to lowwage low skilled quota free economies like the ready made garment industry in Bangladesh where poor women make up the majority of labor force Despite a large proportion of women workers in the garment industry women are still heavily underemployed compared to men Most women that are employed in the garment industry come from the countryside of Bangladesh triggering migration of women in search of garment work It is still unclear as to whether or not access to paid work for women where it did not exist before has empowered them The answers varied depending on whether it is the employers perspective or the workers and how they view their choices Women workers did not see the garment industry as economically sustainable for them in the long run due to long hours standing and poor working conditions Although women workers did show significant autonomy over their personal lives including their ability to negotiate with family more choice in marriage and being valued as a wage earner in the family This did not translate into workers being able to collectively organize themselves in order to negotiate a better deal for themselves at work Another example of outsourcing in manufacturing includes the maquiladora industry in Ciudad Juarez Mexico where poor women make up the majority of the labor force Women in the maquiladora industry have produced high levels of turnover not staying long enough to be trained compared to men A gendered two tiered system within the maquiladora industry has been created that focuses on training and worker loyalty Women are seen as being untrainable placed in unskilled low wage jobs while men are seen as more trainable with less turnover rates and placed in more high skilled technical jobs The idea of training has become a tool used against women to blame them for their high turnover rates which also benefit the industry keeping women as temporary workers Other dimensions Scholars also occasionally discuss other less common dimensions of globalization such as environmental globalization the internationally coordinated practices and regulations often in the form of international treaties regarding environmental protection or military globalization growth in global extent and scope of security relationships Those dimensions however receive much less attention the three described above as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas economic globalization cultural globalization and political globalization Movement of people An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people and stateboundary limits on that movement have changed across history The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century As transportation technology improved travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century For example travel across the Atlantic Ocean used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days Today modern aviation has made longdistance transportation quick and affordable Tourism is travel for pleasure The developments in technology and transportation infrastructure such as jumbo jets lowcost airlines and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable At any given moment half a million people are in the air International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012 A visa is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within or to leave that country Some countries such as those in the Schengen Area have agreements with other countries allowing each others citizens to travel between them without visas for example Switzerland is part of a Schengen Agreement allowing easy travel for people from countries within the European Union The World Tourism Organization announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015 Immigration is the international movement of people into a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens or to takeup employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker According to the International Labour Organization as of 2014 there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active ie being employed or seeking employment International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development For example freedom of movement for workers in the European Union means that people can move freely between member states to live work study or retire in another country Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in international education The development of global crosscultural competence in the workforce through adhoc training has deserved increasing attention in recent times More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many international students now consider overseas study a steppingstone to permanent residency within a country The contributions that foreign students make to host nation economies both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students including substantial amendments to immigration and visa policies and procedures A transnational marriage is a marriage between two people from different countries A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries including those related to citizenship and culture which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships In an age of increasing globalization where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe rather than to a current geographic location people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries Transnational marriage is a byproduct of the movement and migration of people Movement of information Before electronic communications longdistance communications relied on mail Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services especially horses and ships until the mid19th century The electric telegraph was the first method of instant longdistance communication For example before the first transatlantic cable communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean The first transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably allowing a message and a response in the same day Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 18651866 The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895 The Internet has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries For example Facebook is a social networking service which has more than 165 billion monthly active users as of 31 March 2016 Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions practices problems life conditions etc in different parts of the world are interrelated possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism Globalization and disease In the current era of globalization the world is more interdependent than at any other time Efficient and inexpensive transportation has left few places inaccessible and increased global trade has brought more and more people into contact with animal diseases that have subsequently jumped species barriers see zoonosis Coronavirus disease 2019 abbreviated COVID19 first appeared in Wuhan China in November 2019 More than 180 countries have reported cases since then As of April 6 2020 the US has the most confirmed active cases in the world More than 34 million people from the worstaffected countries entered the US in the first three months since the inception of the COVID19 pandemic This has caused a detrimental impact on the global economy particularly for SMEs and Microbusinesses with unlimited liabilityselfemployed leaving them vulnerable to financial difficulties increasing the market share for oligopolistic markets as well as increasing the barriers of entry Measurement One index of globalization is the KOF Index of Globalization which measures three important dimensions of globalization economic social and political Another is the AT Kearney Foreign Policy Magazine Globalization Index Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as trade Foreign Direct Investment FDI Gross Domestic Product GDP portfolio investment and income However newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms including variables related to political social cultural and even environmental aspects of globalization The DHL Global Connectedness Index studies four main types of crossborder flow trade in both goods and services information people including tourists students and migrants and capital It shows that the depth of global integration fell by about onetenth after 2008 but by 2013 had recovered well above its precrash peak The report also found a shift of economic activity to emerging economies Support and criticism Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade Philosophical differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broadrange of ideologies and social movements Proponents of economic growth expansion and development in general view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the wellbeing of human society Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social wellbeing on a global or local scale this includes those who focus on social or natural sustainability of longterm and continuous economic expansion the social structural inequality caused by these processes and the colonial imperialistic or hegemonic ethnocentrism cultural assimilation and cultural appropriation that underlie such processes Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures Xenophobia is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup including a fear of losing identity suspicion of its activities aggression and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs They challenge directly traditional metrics such as GDP and look to other measures such as the Gini coefficient or the Happy Planet Index and point to a multitude of interconnected fatal consequencessocial disintegration a breakdown of democracy more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment the spread of new diseases increasing poverty and alienation which they claim are the unintended consequences of globalization Others point out that while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of westernstyle democracy this has been accompanied by an increase in interethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution On 9 August 2019 Pope Francis denounced isolationism and hinted that the Catholic Church will embrace globalization at the October 2019 Amazonia Synod stating the whole is greater than the parts Globalization and unity should not be conceived as a sphere but as a polyhedron each people retains its identity in unity with others Public opinion As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon globalization is considered by some as a form of capitalist expansion which entails the integration of local and national economies into a global unregulated market economy A 2005 study by Peer Fis and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior In 1998 negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10 of the total in 1991 to 55 of the total in 1999 This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America In Africa a Gallup poll found that 70 of the population views globalization favorably The BBC found that 50 of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly while 35 believed it was proceeding too slowly In 2004 Philip Gordon stated that a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalizations benefits while shielding them from its negative effects The main opposition consisted of socialists environmental groups and nationalists Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004 The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wagebenefit cuts Social spending was much higher than in the US In a Danish poll in 2007 76 responded that globalization is a good thing Fiss et al surveyed US opinion in 1993 Their survey showed that in 1993 more than 40 of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization When the survey was repeated in 1998 89 of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad At the same time discourse on globalization which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995 this event and subsequent protests led to a largescale antiglobalization movement Initially college educated workers were likely to support globalization Less educated workers who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries tended to be opponents The situation changed after the Great Recession According to a 1997 poll 58 of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US By 2008 only 33 thought it was good Respondents with high school education also became more opposed According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi as of 1998 there was a perception in Japan that the economy was Small and Frail However Japan was resourcepoor and used exports to pay for its raw materials Anxiety over their position caused terms such as internationalization and globalization to enter everyday language However Japanese tradition was to be as selfsufficient as possible particularly in agriculture Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism Opponents consider governments as agents of neocolonialism that are subservient to multinational corporations Much of this criticism comes from the middle class the Brookings Institution suggested this was because the middle class perceived upwardly mobile lowincome groups as threatening to their economic security Economics The literature analyzing the economics of free trade is extremely rich with extensive work having been done on the theoretical and empirical effects Though it creates winners and losers the broad consensus among economists is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society In a 2006 survey of 83 American economists 875 agree that the US should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade and 901 disagree with the suggestion that the US should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries Quoting Harvard economics professor N Gregory Mankiw Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards In a survey of leading economists none disagreed with the notion that freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment Most economists would agree that although increasing returns to scale might mean that certain industry could settle in a geographical area without any strong economic reason derived from comparative advantage this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both winner and loser will increase with the winner gaining more than the loser but both gaining more than before in an absolute level In the book The End of Poverty Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a countrys ability to enter the world market including government corruption legal and social disparities based on gender ethnicity or caste diseases such as AIDS and malaria lack of infrastructure including transportation communications health and trade unstable political landscapes protectionism and geographic barriers Jagdish Bhagwati a former adviser to the UN on globalization holds that although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth However economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty in fact the two can coexist Economic growth is conventionally measured using indicators such as GDP and GNI that do not accurately reflect the growing disparities in wealth Additionally Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalizationinduced opportunities by a lack of productive assets weak infrastructure poor education and illhealth effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a poverty trap Economist Paul Krugman is another staunch supporter of globalization and free trade with a record of disagreeing with many critics of globalization He argues that many of them lack a basic understanding of comparative advantage and its importance in todays world The flow of migrants to advanced economies has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise Lastly the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization Technological innovations or technological transfer are conjectured to benefit most developing and least developing countries LDCs as for example in the adoption of mobile phones There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing market orientationbased economic policies that encourage private property rights free enterprise and competition In particular in East Asian developing countries GDP per head rose at 59 a year from 1975 to 2001 according to 2003 Human Development Report of UNDP Like this the British economic journalist Martin Wolf says that incomes of poor developing countries with more than half the worlds population grew substantially faster than those of the worlds richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and hence reduced inequality According to Wolf in the developing world as a whole life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions Also adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53 in 1970 to 74 in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes Furthermore the reduction in fertility rate in the developing world as a whole from 41 births per woman in 1980 to 28 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment Consequently more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor Thus despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole Per capita gross domestic product GDP growth among post1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 14 percent a year in the 1960s and 29 percent a year in the 1970s to 35 percent in the 1980s and 50 percent in the 1990s This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 47 percent in the 1960s to 22 percent in the 1990s Also the nonglobalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers with the formers annual growth rates falling from highs of 33 percent during the 1970s to only 14 percent during the 1990s This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth many of them quite substantial The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic interdependence promotes peace This idea had been very powerful during the globalization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was a central doctrine of classical liberals of that era such as the young John Maynard Keynes 18831946 Some opponents of globalization see the phenomenon as a promotion of corporate interests They also claim that the increasing autonomy and strength of corporate entities shapes the political policy of countries They advocate global institutions and policies that they believe better address the moral claims of poor and working classes as well as environmental concerns Economic arguments by fair trade theorists claim that unrestricted free trade benefits those with more financial leverage ie the rich at the expense of the poor Globalization allows corporations to outsource manufacturing and service jobs from highcost locations creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers The main export of poorer countries is usually agricultural productions Larger countries often subsidize their farmers eg the EUs Common Agricultural Policy which lowers the market price for foreign crops Global democracy Democratic globalization is a movement towards an institutional system of global democracy that would give world citizens a say in political organizations This would in their view bypass nationstates corporate oligopolies ideological nongovernmental organizations NGO political cults and mafias One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker David Held Advocates of democratic globalization argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization which is to be followed by a phase of building global political institutions Francesco Stipo Director of the United States Association of the Club of Rome advocates unifying nations under a world government suggesting that it should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence Former Canadian Senator Douglas Roche OC viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a directly elected United Nations Parliamentary Assembly to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies Global civics Global civics suggests that civics can be understood in a global sense as a social contract between global citizens in the age of interdependence and interaction The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth World citizen has a variety of similar meanings often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional geopolitical divisions derived from national citizenship An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in Socrates whom Plutarch quoted as saying I am not an Athenian or a Greek but a citizen of the world In an increasingly interdependent world world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation Bahaiinspired author Meyjes while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness warns of globalization as a cloak for an expeditious economic social and cultural Anglodominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization He proposes a process of universalization as an alternative Cosmopolitanism is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single community based on a shared morality A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality a shared economic relationship or a political structure that encompasses different nations The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places eg nationstates form relationships based on mutual respect For instance Kwame Anthony Appiah suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations physical economic etc enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs religious political etc Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan popularized the term Global Village beginning in 1962 His view suggested that globalization would lead to a world where people from all countries will become more integrated and aware of common interests and shared humanity International cooperation Military cooperation Past examples of international cooperation exist One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War which astonished international society Arms control and disarmament agreements including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty see START I START II START III and New START and the establishment of NATOs Partnership for Peace the Russia NATO Council and the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and denuclearization The USRussian cooperation was further strengthened by antiterrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 911 Environmental cooperation One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon CFC emissions as specified in the Montreal Protocol in order to stop ozone depletion The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the nonalternative coalburning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do Thirdly significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies Economic cooperation One of the biggest challenges in 2019 with globalization is that many believe the progress made in the past decades are now back tracking The back tracking of globalization has coined the term Slobalization Slobalization is a new slower pattern of globalization Antiglobalization movement Antiglobalization or counterglobalization consists of a number of criticisms of globalization but in general is critical of the globalization of corporate capitalism The movement is also commonly referred to as the alterglobalization movement antiglobalist movement anticorporate globalization movement or movement against neoliberal globalization Opponents of globalization argue that power and respect in terms of international trade between the developed and underdeveloped countries of the world are unequally distributed The diverse subgroups that make up this movement include some of the following trade unionists environmentalists anarchists land rights and indigenous rights activists organizations promoting human rights and sustainable development opponents of privatization and antisweatshop campaigners In The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy Christopher Lasch analyzed the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States For him our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon the revolt of the elites in reference to The Revolt of the Masses 1929 by the Spanish philosopher Jos Ortega y Gasset According to Lasch the new elites ie those who are in the top 20 in terms of income through globalization which allows total mobility of capital no longer live in the same world as their fellowcitizens In this they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations Globalization according to the sociologist has turned elites into tourists in their own countries The denationalization of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as world citizens but without accepting any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies Their ties to an international culture of work leisure information make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of national decline Instead of financing public services and the public treasury new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos private schools in their residential neighborhoods private police garbage collection systems They have withdrawn from common life Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate So the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues However they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes the decline of industrial activity the resulting loss of employment the decline of the middle class increasing the number of the poor the rising crime rate growing drug trafficking the urban crisis DA Snow et al contend that the antiglobalization movement is an example of a new social movement which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the Battle of Seattle in 1999 where there were protests against the World Trade Organizations Third Ministerial Meeting All over the world the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO the International Monetary Fund IMF the World Bank the World Economic Forum and the Group of Eight G8 Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization Opposition to capital market integration Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises Increasing integration of these financial markets between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market In the long run increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group in the short run owners and workers in specific sectors in capitalexporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of human rights issues are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that they say promote neoliberalism without regard to ethical standards Common targets include the World Bank WB International Monetary Fund IMF the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD and the World Trade Organization WTO and free trade treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA Free Trade Area of the Americas FTAA the Multilateral Agreement on Investment MAI and the General Agreement on Trade in Services GATS In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the undercapitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations often termed the North in opposition to the developing worlds South Anticorporatism and anticonsumerism Corporatist ideology which privileges the rights of corporations artificial or juridical persons over those of natural persons is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce In recent years there have been an increasing number of books Naomi Kleins 2000 No Logo for example and films eg The Corporation Surplus popularizing an anticorporate ideology to the public A related contemporary ideology consumerism which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services also drives globalization Anticonsumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism and the incorporation of consumer education into school curricula Social activists hold materialism is connected to global retail merchandizing and supplier convergence war greed anomie crime environmental degradation and general social malaise and discontent One variation on this topic is activism by postconsumers with the strategic emphasis on moving beyond addictive consumerism Global justice and inequality Global justice The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groupsoften referred to as a movement of movementswho advocate fair trade rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems The movement is often labeled an antiglobalization movement by the mainstream media Those involved however frequently deny that they are antiglobalization insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power The movement is based in the idea of social justice desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of equality and solidarity the values of human rights and the dignity of every human being Social inequality within and between nations including a growing global digital divide is a focal point of the movement Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America Africa and Asia face A few very popular and well known nongovernmental organizations NGOs include War Child Red Cross Free The Children and CARE International They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools fixing infrastructure cleaning water supplies purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals and other aid efforts Social inequality The economies of the world have developed unevenly historically such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis From around 1980 through at least 2011 the GDP gap while still wide appeared to be closing and in some more rapidly developing countries life expectancies began to rise If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income since the late 1980s the gap between some regions has markedly narrowedbetween Asia and the advanced economies of the West for examplebut huge gaps remain globally Overall equality across humanity considered as individuals has improved very little Within the decade between 2003 and 2013 income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany Sweden and Denmark With a few exceptionsFrance Japan Spainthe top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind By 2013 85 multibillionaires had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half 35 billion of the worlds total population of 7 billion Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak labor unions the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an evergrowing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in highcost areas Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline They also cite an increase in the exploitation of child labor countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them Examples include quarrying salvage and farm work as well as trafficking bondage forced labor prostitution and pornography Women often participate in the workforce in precarious work including exportoriented employment Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded womens access to employment the longterm goal of transforming gender inequalities remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the states role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net Furthermore the intersectionality of gender race class can be overlooked by scholars and commentators when assessing the impact of globalization In 2016 a study published by the IMF posited that neoliberalism the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism has been oversold with the benefits of neoliberal policies being fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries and the costs most significantly higher income inequality within nations hurt the level and sustainability of growth Antiglobal governance Beginning in the 1930s opposition arose to the idea of a world government as advocated by organizations such as the World Federalist Movement WFM Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible inevitably oppressive or simply unnecessary In general these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the League of Nations and later the United Nations Environmentalist opposition Environmentalism is a broad philosophy ideology and social movement regarding concerns for environmental conservation and improvement of the health of the environment Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as global warming global water supply and water crises inequity in energy consumption and energy conservation transnational air pollution and pollution of the world ocean overpopulation world habitat sustainability deforestation biodiversity loss and species extinction One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy Globalization is thus leading to a type of environmental apartheid Helena NorbergHodge the director and founder of Local FuturesInternational Society for Ecology and Culture criticizes globalization in many ways In her book Ancient Futures NorbergHodge claims that centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them A related area of concern is the pollution haven hypothesis which posits that when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require see Race to the bottom This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent environmental regulations and conversely nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards Thus companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to relocate to the countries with the lowest environmental standards or weakest enforcement The European UnionMercosur Free Trade Agreement which would form one of the worlds largest free trade areas has been denounced by environmental activists and indigenous rights campaigners The fear is that the deal could lead to more deforestation of the Amazon rainforest as it expands market access to Brazilian beef See also References Further reading

    title: "Great Depression",
    originalContent:
      "The Great Depression was a severe global economic downturn from 1929 to 1939 The period was characterized by high rates of unemployment and poverty drastic reductions in liquidity industrial production and trade and widespread bank and business failures around the world The economic contagion began in 1929 in the United States the largest economy in the world with the devastating Wall Street stock market crash of October 1929 often considered the beginning of the Depression Among the countries with the most unemployed were the US the United Kingdom and Germany The Depression was preceded by a period of industrial growth and social development known as the Roaring Twenties Much of the profit generated by the boom was invested in speculation such as on the stock market which resulted in growing wealth inequality Banks were subject to minimal regulation under laissezfaire economic policies resulting in loose lending and widespread debt By 1929 declining spending had led to reductions in manufacturing output and rising unemployment Share values continued to rise until the Wall Street crash after which the slide continued for three years accompanied by a loss of confidence in the financial system By 1933 the unemployment rate in the US had risen to 25 percent about onethird of farmers had lost their land and about half of its 25000 banks had gone out of business The US federal government under President Herbert Hoover was unwilling to intervene heavily in the economy In the 1932 presidential election Hoover was defeated by Franklin D Roosevelt who from 1933 pursued a set of expansive New Deal programs in order to provide relief and create jobs In Germany which depended heavily on US loans the crisis caused unemployment to rise to nearly 30 and fueled political extremism paving the way for Adolf Hitlers Nazi Party to rise to power in 1933 Between 1929 and 1932 worldwide gross domestic product GDP fell by an estimated 15 in the US the Depression resulted in a 30 contraction in GDP Recovery varied greatly around the world Some economies such as the US Germany and Japan started to recover by the mid1930s others like France did not return to preshock growth rates until later in the decade The Depression had devastating economic effects on both wealthy and poor countries all experienced drops in personal income prices deflation tax revenues and profits International trade fell by more than 50 and unemployment in some countries rose as high as 33 Cities around the world especially those dependent on heavy industry were heavily affected Construction virtually halted in many countries and farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by up to 60 Faced with plummeting demand and few job alternatives areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most The outbreak of World War II in 1939 ended the Depression as it stimulated factory production providing jobs for women as militaries absorbed large numbers of young unemployed men The precise causes for the Great Depression are disputed One set of historians for example focuses on nonmonetary economic causes Among these some regard the Wall Street crash itself as the main cause others consider that the crash was a mere symptom of more general economic trends of the time which had already been underway in the late 1920s A contrasting set of views which rose to prominence in the later part of the 20th century ascribes a more prominent role to failures of monetary policy According to those authors while general economic trends can explain the emergence of the downturn they fail to account for its severity and longevity they argue that these were caused by the lack of an adequate response to the crises of liquidity that followed the initial economic shock of 1929 and the subsequent bank failures accompanied by a general collapse of the financial markets Overview The economic picture at the beginning of the crisis After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from 381 to 198 over the course of two months optimism persisted for some time The stock market rose in early 1930 with the Dow returning to 294 predepression levels in April 1930 before steadily declining for years to a low of 41 in 1932 At the beginning governments and businesses spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year On the other hand consumers many of whom suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year cut expenditures by 10 In addition beginning in the mid1930s a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the US Interest rates dropped to low levels by mid1930 but expected deflation and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that consumer spending and investment remained low By May 1930 automobile sales declined to below the levels of 1928 Prices in general began to decline although wages held steady in 1930 Then a deflationary spiral started in 1931 Farmers faced a worse outlook declining crop prices and a Great Plains drought crippled their economic outlook At its peak the Great Depression saw nearly 10 of all Great Plains farms change hands despite federal assistance Beyond the US At first the decline in the US economy was the factor that triggered economic downturns in most other countries due to a decline in trade capital movement and global business confidence Then internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better For example the UK economy which experienced an economic downturn throughout most of the late 1920s was less severely impacted by the shock of the depression than the US By contrast the German economy saw a similar decline in industrial output as that observed in the US Some economic historians attribute the differences in the rates of recovery and relative severity of the economic decline to whether particular countries had been able to effectively devaluate their currencies or not This is supported by the contrast in how the crisis progressed in eg Britain Argentina and Brazil all of which devalued their currencies early and returned to normal patterns of growth relatively rapidly and countries which stuck to the gold standard such as France or Belgium Frantic attempts by individual countries to shore up their economies through protectionist policies such as the 1930 US SmootHawley Tariff Act and retaliatory tariffs in other countries exacerbated the collapse in global trade contributing to the depression By 1933 the economic decline pushed world trade to one third of its level compared to four years earlier Course Origins While the precise causes for the occurrence of the Great depression are disputed and can be traced to both global and national phenomena its immediate origins are most conveniently examined in the context of the US economy from which the initial crisis spread to the rest of the world In the aftermath of World War I the Roaring Twenties brought considerable wealth to the United States and Western Europe Initially the year 1929 dawned with good economic prospects despite a minor crash on 25 March 1929 the market seemed to gradually improve through September Stock prices began to slump in September and were volatile at the end of the month A large selloff of stocks began in midOctober Finally on 24 October Black Thursday the American stock market crashed 11 at the opening bell Actions to stabilize the market failed and on 28 October Black Monday the market crashed another 12 The panic peaked the next day on Black Tuesday when the market saw another 11 drop Thousands of investors were ruined and billions of dollars had been lost many stocks could not be sold at any price The market recovered 12 on Wednesday but by then significant damage had been done Though the market entered a period of recovery from 14 November until 17 April 1930 the general situation had been a prolonged slump From 17 April 1930 until 8 July 1932 the market continued to lose 89 of its value Despite the crash the worst of the crisis did not reverberate around the world until after 1929 The crisis hit panic levels again in December 1930 with a bank run on the Bank of United States a former privately run bank bearing no relation to the US government not to be confused with the Federal Reserve Unable to pay out to all of its creditors the bank failed Among the 608 American banks that closed in November and December 1930 the Bank of United States accounted for a third of the total 550 million deposits lost and with its closure bank failures reached a critical mass The SmootHawley Act and the Breakdown of International Trade In an initial response to the crisis the US Congress passed the SmootHawley Tariff Act on 17 June 1930 The Act was ostensibly aimed at protecting the American economy from foreign competition by imposing high tariffs on foreign imports The consensus view among economists and economic historians including Keynesians Monetarists and Austrian economists is that the passage of the SmootHawley Tariff had in fact achieved an opposite effect to what was intended It exacerbated the Great Depression by preventing economic recovery after domestic production recovered hampering the volume of trade still there is disagreement as to the precise extent of the Acts influence In the popular view the SmootHawley Tariff was one of the leading causes of the depression In a 1995 survey of American economic historians twothirds agreed that the SmootHawley Tariff Act at least worsened the Great Depression According to the US Senate website the SmootHawley Tariff Act is among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history Many economists have argued that the sharp decline in international trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade Most historians and economists blame the Act for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the US and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming it was a much larger factor in many other countries The average ad valorem value based rate of duties on dutiable imports for 19211925 was 259 but under the new tariff it jumped to 50 during 19311935 In dollar terms American exports declined over the next four years from about 52 billion in 1929 to 17 billion in 1933 so not only did the physical volume of exports fall but also the prices fell by about 13 as written Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat cotton tobacco and lumber Governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as imposing tariffs import quotas and exchange controls These restrictions triggered much tension among countries that had large amounts of bilateral trade causing major exportimport reductions during the depression Not all governments enforced the same measures of protectionism Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions while other countries reduced trade and exchange restrictions only marginally Countries that remained on the gold standard keeping currencies fixed were more likely to restrict foreign trade These countries resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the balance of payments and limit gold losses They hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline Countries that abandoned the gold standard allowed their currencies to depreciate which caused their balance of payments to strengthen It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism The length and depth of a countrys economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery are related to how long it remained on the gold standard Countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries In contrast countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps The Gold Standard and the Spreading of Global Depression The gold standard was the primary transmission mechanism of the Great Depression Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction firsthand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates Under the gold standards pricespecie flow mechanism countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline deflation There is also consensus that protectionist policies and primarily the passage of the SmootHawley Tariff Act helped to exacerbate or even cause the Great Depression Gold standard Some economic studies have indicated that the rigidities of the gold standard not only spread the downturn worldwide but also suspended gold convertibility devaluing the currency in gold terms that did the most to make recovery possible Every major currency left the gold standard during the Great Depression The UK was the first to do so Facing speculative attacks on the pound and depleting gold reserves in September 1931 the Bank of England ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets Japan and the Scandinavian countries followed in 1931 Other countries such as Italy and the United States remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933 while a few countries in the socalled gold bloc led by France and including Poland Belgium and Switzerland stayed on the standard until 193536 According to later analysis the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery For example The UK and Scandinavia which left the gold standard in 1931 recovered much earlier than France and Belgium which remained on gold much longer Countries such as China which had a silver standard almost avoided the depression entirely The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that countrys severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries including developing countries This partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between regions and states around the world German banking crisis of 1931 and British crisis The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid1931 starting with the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in Vienna in May This put heavy pressure on Germany which was already in political turmoil With the rise in violence of National Socialist Nazi and Communist movements as well as investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies investors withdrew their shortterm money from Germany as confidence spiraled downward The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June 540 million in the second and 150 million in two days 1920 June Collapse was at hand US President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on payment of war reparations This angered Paris which depended on a steady flow of German payments but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium was agreed to in July 1931 An International conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on 19 August a standstill agreement froze Germanys foreign liabilities for six months Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England The funding only slowed the process Industrial failures began in Germany a major bank closed in July and a twoday holiday for all German banks was declared Business failures were more frequent in July and spread to Romania and Hungary The crisis continued to get worse in Germany bringing political upheaval that finally led to the coming to power of Hitlers Nazi regime in January 1933 The world financial crisis now began to overwhelm Britain investors around the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of 25 million per day Credits of 25 million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of 15 million fiduciary note slowed but did not reverse the British crisis The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931 With deficits mounting the bankers demanded a balanced budget the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonalds Labour government agreed it proposed to raise taxes cut spending and most controversially to cut unemployment benefits 20 The attack on welfare was unacceptable to the Labour movement MacDonald wanted to resign but King George V insisted he remain and form an allparty coalition National Government The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on along with a small cadre of Labour but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government Britain went off the gold standard and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression In the 1931 British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed leaving MacDonald as prime minister for a largely Conservative coalition Turning point and recovery In most countries of the world recovery from the Great Depression began in 1933 In the US recovery began in early 1933 but the US did not return to 1929 GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15 in 1940 albeit down from the high of 25 in 1933 There is no consensus among economists regarding the motive force for the US economic expansion that continued through most of the Roosevelt years and the 1937 recession that interrupted it The common view among most economists is that Roosevelts New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelts words and actions portended It was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interruption of a recession beginning in late 1937 One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of 1935 which effectively raised reserve requirements causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery GDP returned to its upward trend in 1938 A revisionist view among some economists holds that the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression as they argue that National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and National Labor Relations Act of 1935 restricted competition and established price fixing John Maynard Keynes did not think that the New Deal under Roosevelt singlehandedly ended the Great Depression It is it seems politically impossible for a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary to make the grand experiments which would prove my caseexcept in war conditions According to Christina Romer the money supply growth caused by huge international gold inflows was a crucial source of the recovery of the United States economy and that the economy showed little sign of selfcorrection The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the US dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe In their book A Monetary History of the United States Milton Friedman and Anna J Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System Chairman of the Federal Reserve 20062014 Ben Bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery Bernanke also saw a strong role for institutional factors particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system and pointed out that the Depression should be examined in an international perspective Role of women and household economics Womens primary role was as housewives without a steady flow of family income their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care Birthrates fell everywhere as children were postponed until families could financially support them The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12 from 193 births per thousand population in 1930 to 170 in 1935 In Canada half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births Among the few women in the labor force layoffs were less common in the whitecollar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work However there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed Across Britain there was a tendency for married women to join the labor force competing for parttime jobs especially In France very slow population growth especially in comparison to Germany continued to be a serious issue in the 1930s Support for increasing welfare programs during the depression included a focus on women in the family The Conseil Suprieur de la Natalit campaigned for provisions enacted in the Code de la Famille 1939 that increased state assistance to families with children and required employers to protect the jobs of fathers even if they were immigrants In rural and smalltown areas women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible In the United States agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs Rural women made feed sack dresses and other items for themselves and their families and homes from feed sacks In American cities African American women quiltmakers enlarged their activities promoted collaboration and trained neophytes Quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment Oral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families Cheap foods were used such as soups beans and noodles They purchased the cheapest cuts of meatsometimes even horse meatand recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups They sewed and patched clothing traded with their neighbors for outgrown items and made do with colder homes New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days Many women also worked outside the home or took boarders did laundry for trade or cash and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer Extended families used mutual aidextra food spare rooms repairwork cash loansto help cousins and inlaws In Japan official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of Keynesian spending Consequently the government launched a campaign across the country to induce households to reduce their consumption focusing attention on spending by housewives In Germany the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the FourYear Plan of 1936 to achieve German economic selfsufficiency The Nazi womens organizations other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic selfsufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war The organizations propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living However these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives World War II and recovery The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery though it did help in reducing unemployment The rearmament policies leading up to World War II helped stimulate the economies of Europe in 19371939 By 1937 unemployment in Britain had fallen to 15 million The mobilization of manpower following the outbreak of war in 1939 ended unemployment The American mobilization for World War II at the end of 1941 moved approximately ten million people out of the civilian labor force and into the war This finally eliminated the last effects from the Great Depression and brought the US unemployment rate down below 10 World War II had a dramatic effect on many parts of the American economy Governmentfinanced capital spending accounted for only 5 of the annual US investment in industrial capital in 1940 by 1943 the government accounted for 67 of US capital investment The massive war spending doubled economic growth rates either masking the effects of the Depression or essentially ending the Depression Businessmen ignored the mounting national debt and heavy new taxes redoubling their efforts for greater output to take advantage of generous government contracts Causes Attempts to return to the Gold Standard During World War I many countries suspended their gold standard in varying ways There was high inflation from WWI and in the 1920s in the Weimar Republic Austria and throughout Europe In the late 1920s there was a scramble to deflate prices to get the gold standards conversation rates back on track to preWWI levels by causing deflation and high unemployment through monetary policy In 1933 FDR signed Executive Order 6102 and in 1934 signed the Gold Reserve Act Keynesian vs Monetarist view The two classic competing economic theories of the Great Depression are the Keynesian demanddriven and the Monetarist explanation There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists The consensus among demanddriven theories is that a largescale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending Once panic and deflation set in many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods exacerbating the drop in demand Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending particularly investment is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression Today there is also significant academic support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz add nonmonetary explanations There is a consensus that the Federal Reserve System should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse by expanding the money supply and acting as lender of last resort If they had done this the economic downturn would have been far less severe and much shorter Mainstream explanations Modern mainstream economists see the reasons in A money supply reduction Monetarists and therefore a banking crisis reduction of credit and bankruptcies Insufficient demand from the private sector and insufficient fiscal spending Keynesians Passage of the SmootHawley Tariff Act exacerbated what otherwise might have been a more standard recession both Monetarists and Keynesians Insufficient spending the money supply reduction and debt on margin led to falling prices and further bankruptcies Irving Fishers debt deflation Monetarist view The monetarist explanation was given by American economists Milton Friedman and Anna J Schwartz They argued that the Great Depression was caused by the banking crisis that caused onethird of all banks to vanish a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction of 35 which they called The Great Contraction This caused a price drop of 33 deflation By not lowering interest rates by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling the Federal Reserve passively watched the transformation of a normal recession into the Great Depression Friedman and Schwartz argued that the downward turn in the economy starting with the stock market crash would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action This view was endorsed in 2002 by Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz with this statement Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve I would like to say to Milton and Anna Regarding the Great Depression youre right We did it Were very sorry But thanks to you we wont do it again The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures particularly that of the New York Bank of United States which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed Friedman and Schwartz argued that if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did With significantly less money to go around businesses could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed forcing many to stop investing This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction especially the New York branch One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was the gold standard At that time the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act which required 40 gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued By the late 1920s the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes A promise of gold is not as good as gold in the hand particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40 of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes was redeemed for Federal Reserve gold Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit On 5 April 1933 President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates coins and bullion illegal reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold Keynesian view British economist John Maynard Keynes argued in The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money that lower aggregate expenditures in the economy contributed to a massive decline in income and to employment that was well below the average In such a situation the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment Keyness basic idea was simple to keep people fully employed governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending or cutting taxes As the Depression wore on Franklin D Roosevelt tried public works farm subsidies and other devices to restart the US economy but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget According to the Keynesians this improved the economy but Roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of World War II Debt deflation Irving Fisher argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was a vicious circle of deflation and growing overindebtedness He outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust The chain of events proceeded as follows Debt liquidation and distress selling Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off A fall in the level of asset prices A still greater fall in the net worth of businesses precipitating bankruptcies A fall in profits A reduction in output in trade and in employment Pessimism and loss of confidence Hoarding of money A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression margin requirements were only 10 Brokerage firms in other words would lend 9 for every 1 an investor had deposited When the market fell brokers called in these loans which could not be paid back Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse triggering multiple bank runs Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets Outstanding debts became heavier because prices and incomes fell by 2050 but the debts remained at the same dollar amount After the panic of 1929 and during the first 10 months of 1930 744 US banks failed In all 9000 banks failed during the 1930s By April 1933 around 7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans that borrowers did not have time or money to repay With future profits looking poor capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans which intensified deflationary pressures A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices that it caused The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed relative to the value of declining asset holdings The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it Paradoxically the more the debtors paid the more they owed This selfaggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression Fishers debtdeflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counterargument that debtdeflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group debtors to another creditors Pure redistributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects Building on both the monetary hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz and the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output He builds on Fishers argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently lowers aggregate demand a further price level decline would then result in a debt deflationary spiral According to Bernanke a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions which in turn leads to a credit crunch that seriously harms the economy A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption which results in declining aggregate demand and additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral Expectations hypothesis Since economic mainstream turned to the new neoclassical synthesis expectations are a central element of macroeconomic models According to Peter Temin Barry Wigmore Gauti B Eggertsson and Christina Romer the key to recovery and to ending the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive in March 1933 when Franklin D Roosevelt took office Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation industrial production bottomed out in March 1933 and investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933 There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround Money supply was still falling and shortterm interest rates remained close to zero Before March 1933 people expected further deflation and a recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion With these positive expectations interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do Roosevelts fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped make his policy objectives credible The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investment The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard a balanced budget in times of crisis and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 7080 of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937 If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933 and output would have been 30 lower in 1937 than in 1933 The recession of 19371938 which slowed down economic recovery from the Great Depression is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in 1937 were first steps to a restoration of the pre1933 policy regime Common position There is common consensus among economists today that the government and the central bank should work to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates of gross domestic product and money supply on a stable growth path When threatened by expectations of a depression central banks should expand liquidity in the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to prevent a collapse in money supply and aggregate demand At the beginning of the Great Depression most economists believed in Says law and the equilibrating powers of the market and failed to understand the severity of the Depression Outright leaveitalone liquidationism was a common position and was universally held by Austrian School economists The liquidationist position held that a depression worked to liquidate failed businesses and investments that had been made obsolete by technological development releasing factors of production capital and labor to be redeployed in other more productive sectors of the dynamic economy They argued that even if selfadjustment of the economy caused mass bankruptcies it was still the best course Economists like Barry Eichengreen and J Bradford DeLong note that President Herbert Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932 when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of many Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist position led to disastrous consequences Unlike what liquidationists expected a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the Great Depression According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre1924 levels by 1933 Milton Friedman called leaveitalone liquidationism dangerous nonsense He wrote I think the Austrian businesscycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm If you go back to the 1930s which is a key point here you had the Austrians sitting in London Hayek and Lionel Robbins and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world Youve just got to let it cure itself You cant do anything about it You will only make it worse I think by encouraging that kind of donothing policy both in Britain and in the United States they did harm Heterodox theories Austrian School Two prominent theorists in the Austrian School on the Great Depression include Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and American economist Murray Rothbard who wrote Americas Great Depression 1963 In their view much like the monetarists the Federal Reserve created in 1913 shoulders much of the blame however unlike the Monetarists they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the money supply in the 1920s which led to an unsustainable creditdriven boom In the Austrian view it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices stocks and bonds and capital goods Therefore by the time the Federal Reserve tightened in 1928 it was far too late to prevent an economic contraction In February 1929 Hayek published a paper predicting the Federal Reserves actions would lead to a crisis starting in the stock and credit markets According to Rothbard the government support for failed enterprises and efforts to keep wages above their market values actually prolonged the Depression Unlike Rothbard after 1970 Hayek believed that the Federal Reserve had further contributed to the problems of the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression However during the Depression in 1932 and in 1934 Hayek had criticized both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England for not taking a more contractionary stance Hans Sennholz argued that most boom and busts that plagued the American economy such as those in 181920 18391843 18571860 18731878 18931897 and 192021 were generated by government creating a boom through easy money and credit which was soon followed by the inevitable bust Ludwig von Mises wrote in the 1930s Credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods It merely brings about a rearrangement It diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods As a result the upswing lacks a solid base It is not real prosperity It is illusory prosperity It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth ie the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment Rather it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase Sooner or later it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand Marxist Marxists generally argue that the Great Depression was the result of the inherent instability of the capitalist mode of production According to Forbes The idea that capitalism caused the Great Depression was widely held among intellectuals and the general public for many decades Inequality Two economists of the 1920s Waddill Catchings and William Trufant Foster popularized a theory that influenced many policy makers including Herbert Hoover Henry A Wallace Paul Douglas and Marriner Eccles It held the economy produced more than it consumed because the consumers did not have enough income Thus the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the 1920s caused the Great Depression According to this view the root cause of the Great Depression was a global overinvestment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses such as farms The proposed solution was for the government to pump money into the consumers pockets That is it must redistribute purchasing power maintaining the industrial base and reinflating prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into consumer spending The economy was overbuilt and new factories were not needed Foster and Catchings recommended federal and state governments to start large construction projects a program followed by Hoover and Roosevelt Productivity shock It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the productivity output and employment trends we are describing are longtime trends and were thoroughly evident before 1929 These trends are in nowise the result of the present depression nor are they the result of the World War On the contrary the present depression is a collapse resulting from these longterm trends The first three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with electrification mass production and motorized farm machinery and because of the rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced The dramatic rise in productivity of major industries in the US and the effects of productivity on output wages and the workweek are discussed by Spurgeon Bell in his book Productivity Wages and National Income 1940 Effects by country The majority of countries set up relief programs and most underwent some sort of political upheaval pushing them to the right Many of the countries in Europe and Latin America that were democracies saw their democratic governments overthrown by some form of dictatorship or authoritarian rule most famously in Germany in 1933 The Dominion of Newfoundland abandoned its autonomy within the British Empire becoming the only region ever to voluntarily relinquish democracy There too were severe impacts across the Middle East and North Africa including economic decline which led to social unrest Argentina Decline in foreign trade hit Argentina hard The British decision to stop importing Argentine beef led to the signing of the RocaRunciman Treaty which preserved a quota in exchange for significant concessions to British exports By 1935 the economy had recovered to 1929 levels and the same year the Central Bank of Argentina was formed However the Great Depression was the last time when Argentina was one of the richer countries of the world as it stopped growing in the decades thereafter and became underdeveloped Australia Australias dependence on agricultural and industrial exports meant it was one of the hardesthit developed countries Falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive downward pressures on wages Unemployment reached a record high of 29 in 1932 with incidents of civil unrest becoming common After 1932 an increase in wool and meat prices led to a gradual recovery Canada Harshly affected by both the global economic downturn and the Dust Bowl Canadian industrial production had by 1932 fallen to only 58 of its 1929 figure the secondlowest level in the world after the United States and well behind countries such as Britain which fell to only 83 of the 1929 level Total national income fell to 56 of the 1929 level again worse than any country apart from the United States Unemployment reached 27 at the depth of the Depression in 1933 Chile The League of Nations labeled Chile the country hardesthit by the Great Depression because 80 of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates which were in low demand Chile initially felt the impact of the Great Depression in 1930 when GDP dropped 14 mining income declined 27 and export earnings fell 28 By 1932 GDP had shrunk to less than half of what it had been in 1929 exacting a terrible toll in unemployment and business failures Influenced profoundly by the Great Depression many government leaders promoted the development of local industry in an effort to insulate the economy from future external shocks After six years of government austerity measures which succeeded in reestablishing Chiles creditworthiness Chileans elected to office during the 193858 period a succession of center and leftofcenter governments interested in promoting economic growth through government intervention Prompted in part by the devastating 1939 Chilln earthquake the Popular Front government of Pedro Aguirre Cerda created the Production Development Corporation Corporacin de Fomento de la Produccin CORFO to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization Consequently as in other Latin American countries protectionism became an entrenched aspect of the Chilean economy China China was largely unaffected by the Depression mainly by having stuck to the Silver standard However the US silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on Chinas silver coins and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks legal note issues China and the British colony of Hong Kong which followed suit in this regard in September 1935 would be the last to abandon the silver standard In addition the Nationalist Government also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems stabilize prices amortize debts reform the banking and currency systems build railroads and highways improve public health facilities legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production On 3 November 1935 the government instituted the fiat currency fapi reform immediately stabilizing prices and also raising revenues for the government European African colonies The sharp fall in commodity prices and the steep decline in exports hurt the economies of the European colonies in Africa and Asia The agricultural sector was especially hardhit For example sisal had recently become a major export crop in Kenya and Tanganyika During the depression it suffered severely from low prices and marketing problems that affected all colonial commodities in Africa Sisal producers established centralized controls for the export of their fibre There was widespread unemployment and hardship among peasants labourers colonial auxiliaries and artisans The budgets of colonial governments were cut which forced the reduction in ongoing infrastructure projects such as the building and upgrading of roads ports and communications The budget cuts delayed the schedule for creating systems of higher education The depression severely hurt the exportbased Belgian Congo economy because of the drop in international demand for raw materials and for agricultural products For example the price of peanuts fell from 125 to 25 centimes In some areas as in the Katanga mining region employment declined by 70 In the country as a whole the wage labour force decreased by 72000 people and many men returned to their villages In Leopoldville the population decreased by 33 because of this labour migration Political protests were not common However there was a growing demand that the paternalistic claims be honored by colonial governments to respond vigorously The theme was that economic reforms were more urgently needed than political reforms French West Africa launched an extensive program of educational reform in which rural schools designed to modernize agriculture would stem the flow of underemployed farm workers to cities where unemployment was high Students were trained in traditional arts crafts and farming techniques and were then expected to return to their own villages and towns France The crisis affected France a bit later than other countries hitting hard around 1931 While the 1920s grew at the very strong rate of 443 per year the 1930s rate fell to only 063 The depression was relatively mild unemployment peaked under 5 the fall in production was at most 20 below the 1929 output there was no banking crisis However the depression had drastic effects on the local economy and partly explains the February 6 1934 riots and even more the formation of the Popular Front led by SFIO socialist leader Lon Blum which won the elections in 1936 Ultranationalist groups also saw increased popularity though democracy prevailed into World War II Frances relatively high degree of selfsufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in neighbouring states like Germany Germany The Great Depression hit Germany hard The impact of the Wall Street Crash forced American banks to end the new loans that had been funding the repayments under the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid1931 starting with the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in Vienna in May This put heavy pressure on Germany which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of national socialist and communist movements as well as with investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies investors withdrew their shortterm money from Germany as confidence spiraled downward The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June 540 million in the second and 150 million in two days 1920 June Collapse was at hand US President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on payment of war reparations This angered Paris which depended on a steady flow of German payments but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium was agreed to in July 1931 An international conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on 19 August a standstill agreement froze Germanys foreign liabilities for six months Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England The funding only slowed the process Industrial failures began in Germany a major bank closed in July and a twoday holiday for all German banks was declared Business failures became more frequent in July and spread to Romania and Hungary In 1932 90 of German reparation payments were cancelled in the 1950s Germany repaid all its missed reparations debts Widespread unemployment reached 25 as every sector was hurt The government did not increase government spending to deal with Germanys growing crisis as they were afraid that a highspending policy could lead to a return of the hyperinflation that had affected Germany in 1923 Germanys Weimar Republic was hit hard by the depression as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped The unemployment rate reached nearly 30 in 1932 The German political landscape was dramatically altered leading to Adolf Hitlers rise to power The Nazi Party rose from being peripheral to winning 183 of the vote in the September 1930 election and the Communist Party also made gains while moderate forces like the Social Democratic Party the Democratic Party and the Peoples Party lost seats The next two years were marked by increased street violence between Nazis and Communists while governments under President Paul von Hindenburg increasingly relied on rule by decree bypassing the Reichstag Hitler ran for the Presidency in 1932 and while he lost to the incumbent Hindenburg in the election it marked a point during which both Nazi Party and the Communist parties rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a Reichstag majority following the general election in July 1932 Although the Nazis lost seats in November 1932 election they remained the largest party and Hitler was appointed as Chancellor the following January The government formation deal was designed to give Hitlers conservative coalition partners many checks on his power but over the next few months the Nazis manoeuvred to consolidate a singleparty dictatorship Hitler followed an economic policy of autarky creating a network of client states and economic allies in central Europe and Latin America By cutting wages and taking control of labor unions plus public works spending unemployment fell significantly by 1935 Largescale military spending played a major role in the recovery The policies had the effect of driving up the cost of food imports and depleting foreign currency reserves leading to economic impasse by 1936 Nazi Germany faced a choice of either reversing course or pressing ahead with rearmament and autarky Hitler chose the latter route which according to Ian Kershaw could only be partially accomplished without territorial expansion and therefore war Greece The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932 The Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries but these largely failed For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the US dollar but this was unsustainable given the countrys large trade deficit and the only longterm effects of this were Greeces foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932 Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April 1931 This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK France and the Middle East for many necessities Greece went off the gold standard in April 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas which several European countries also did during the period Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma and the stifling of imports allowed the Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression In 1939 the Greek industrial output was 179 that of 1928 These industries were for the most part built on sand as one report of the Bank of Greece put it as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive Despite the global depression Greece managed to suffer comparatively little averaging an average growth rate of 35 from 1932 to 1939 The dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas took over the Greek government in 1936 and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War Iceland Icelandic postWorld War I prosperity came to an end with the outbreak of the Great Depression The Depression hit Iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted The total value of Icelandic exports fell from 74 million kronur in 1929 to 48 million in 1932 and was not to rise again to the pre1930 level until after 1939 Government interference in the economy increased Imports were regulated trade with foreign currency was monopolized by stateowned banks and loan capital was largely distributed by stateregulated funds Due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War which cut Icelands exports of saltfish by half the Depression lasted in Iceland until the outbreak of World War II when prices for fish exports soared India How much India was affected has been hotly debated Historians have argued that the Great Depression slowed longterm industrial development Apart from two sectors jute and coal the economy was littleaffected However there were major negative impacts on the jute industry as world demand fell and prices plunged Otherwise conditions were fairly stable Local markets in agriculture and smallscale industry showed modest gains Ireland Frank Barry and Mary E Daly have argued that Ireland was a largely agrarian economy trading almost exclusively with the UK at the time of the Great Depression Beef and dairy products comprised the bulk of exports and Ireland fared well relative to many other commodity producers particularly in the early years of the depression Italy The Great Depression hit Italy very hard As industries came close to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bailoutthe assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless This led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention The Industrial Reconstruction Institute IRI was formed in January 1933 and took control of the bankowned companies suddenly giving Italy the largest stateowned industrial sector in Europe excluding the USSR IRI did rather well with its new responsibilitiesrestructuring modernising and rationalising as much as it could It was a significant factor in post1945 development But it took the Italian economy until 1935 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930a position that was only 60 better than that of 1913 Japan The Great Depression did not strongly affect Japan The Japanese economy shrank by 8 during 192931 Japans Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was the first to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies first by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending and second by devaluing the currency Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets The deficit spending proved to be most profound and went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces By 1933 Japan was already out of the depression By 1934 Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating and to avoid inflation moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists especially those in the army culminating in his assassination in the course of the February 26 Incident This had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government From 1934 the militarys dominance of the government continued to grow Instead of reducing deficit spending the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced but did not eliminate inflation which remained a problem until the end of World War II The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan Japans industrial production doubled during the 1930s Further in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries especially textile companies many of Japans automakers such as Toyota have their roots in the textile industry By 1940 light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy Latin America Because of high levels of US investment in Latin American economies they were severely damaged by the Depression Within the region Chile Bolivia and Peru were particularly badly affected Before the 1929 crisis links between the world economy and Latin American economies had been established through American and British investment in Latin American exports to the world As a result Latin Americans export industries felt the depression quickly World prices for commodities such as wheat coffee and copper plunged Exports from all of Latin America to the US fell in value from 12 billion in 1929 to 335 million in 1933 rising to 660 million in 1940 But on the other hand the depression led the area governments to develop new local industries and expand consumption and production Following the example of the New Deal governments in the area approved regulations and created or improved welfare institutions that helped millions of new industrial workers to achieve a better standard of living Netherlands From roughly 1931 to 1937 the Netherlands suffered a deep and exceptionally long depression This depression was partly caused by the aftereffects of the American stockmarket crash of 1929 and partly by internal factors in the Netherlands Government policy especially the very late dropping of the Gold Standard played a role in prolonging the depression The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to some political instability and riots and can be linked to the rise of the Dutch fascist political party NSB The depression in the Netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of 1936 when the government finally dropped the Gold Standard but real economic stability did not return until after World War II New Zealand New Zealand was especially vulnerable to worldwide depression as it relied almost entirely on agricultural exports to the United Kingdom for its economy The drop in exports led to a lack of disposable income from the farmers who were the mainstay of the local economy Jobs disappeared and wages plummeted leaving people desperate and charities unable to cope Work relief schemes were the only government support available to the unemployed the rate of which by the early 1930s was officially around 15 but unofficially nearly twice that level official figures excluded Mori and women In 1932 riots occurred among the unemployed in three of the countrys main cities Auckland Dunedin and Wellington Many were arrested or injured through the tough official handling of these riots by police and volunteer special constables Persia In Iran then known as the Imperial State of Persia the Great Depression had negative impacts on its exports In 1933 a new concession was signed with the AngloPersian Oil Company Poland Poland was affected by the Great Depression longer and stronger than other countries due to inadequate economic response of the government and the preexisting economic circumstances of the country At that time Poland was under the authoritarian rule of Sanacja whose leader Jzef Pisudski was opposed to leaving the gold standard until his death in 1935 As a result Poland was unable to perform a more active monetary and budget policy Additionally Poland was a relatively young country that emerged merely 10 years earlier after being partitioned between German Russian and the AustroHungarian Empires for over a century Prior to independence the Russian part exported 91 of its exports to Russia proper while the German part exported 68 to Germany proper After independence these markets were largely lost as Russia transformed into USSR that was mostly a closed economy and Germany was in a tariff war with Poland throughout the 1920s Industrial production fell significantly in 1932 hard coal production was down 27 compared to 1928 steel production was down 61 and iron ore production noted an 89 decrease On the other hand electrotechnical leather and paper industries noted marginal increases in production output Overall industrial production decreased by 41 A distinct feature of the Great Depression in Poland was the deconcentration of industry as larger conglomerates were less flexible and paid their workers more than smaller ones Unemployment rate rose significantly up to 43 while nominal wages fell by 51 in 1933 and 56 in 1934 relative to 1928 However real wages fell less due to the governments policy of decreasing cost of living particularly food expenditures food prices were down by 65 in 1935 compared to 1928 price levels Material conditions deprivation led to strikes some of them violent or violently pacified like in Sanok March of the Hungry in Sanok 6 March 1930 Lesko county Lesko uprising 21 June 9 July 1932 and Zawiercie Bloody Friday 1930 18 April 1930 To adapt to the crisis Polish government employed deflation methods such as high interest rates credit limits and budget austerity to keep a fixed exchange rate with currencies tied to the gold standard Only in late 1932 did the government effect a plan to fight the economic crisis Part of the plan was mass public works scheme employing up to 100000 people in 1935 After Pisudskis death in 1936 the gold standard regime was relaxed and launching the development of the Central Industrial Region kicked off the economy to over 10 annual growth rate in the 19361938 period Portugal Already under the rule of a dictatorial junta the Ditadura Nacional Portugal suffered no turbulent political effects of the Depression although Antnio de Oliveira Salazar already appointed Minister of Finance in 1928 greatly expanded his powers and in 1932 rose to Prime Minister of Portugal to found the Estado Novo an authoritarian corporatist dictatorship With the budget balanced in 1929 the effects of the depression were relaxed through harsh measures towards budget balance and autarky causing social discontent but stability and eventually an impressive economic growth Puerto Rico In the years immediately preceding the depression negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers The 1920s brought a dramatic drop in Puerto Ricos two primary exports raw sugar and coffee due to a devastating hurricane in 1928 and the plummeting demand from global markets in the latter half of the decade 1930 unemployment on the island was roughly 36 and by 1933 Puerto Ricos per capita income dropped 30 by comparison unemployment in the United States in 1930 was approximately 8 reaching a height of 25 in 1933 To provide relief and economic reform the United States government and Puerto Rican politicians such as Carlos Chardon and Luis Muoz Marn created and administered first the Puerto Rico Emergency Relief Administration PRERA 1933 and then in 1935 the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration PRRA Romania Romania was also affected by the Great Depression South Africa As world trade slumped demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically The Carnegie Commission on Poor Whites had concluded in 1931 that nearly onethird of Afrikaners lived as paupers The social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the gesuiwerde purified and smelter fusionist factions within the National Party and the National Partys subsequent fusion with the South African Party Unemployment programs were begun that focused primarily on the white population Soviet Union The Soviet Union was the only major socialist state in the world and had very little international trade Its economy was not tied to the rest of the world and was mostly unaffected by the Great Depression At the time of the Depression the Soviet economy was growing steadily fuelled by intensive investment in heavy industry The apparent economic success of the Soviet Union at a time when the capitalist world was in crisis led many Western intellectuals to view the Soviet system favorably Jennifer Burns wrote As the Great Depression ground on and unemployment soared intellectuals began unfavorably comparing their faltering capitalist economy to Russian Communism Karl Marx had predicted that capitalism would fall under the weight of its own contradictions and now with the economic crisis gripping the West his predictions seem to be coming true By contrast Russia seemed an emblematic modern nation making the staggering leap from a feudal past to an industrial future with ease The early years of the Great Depression caused mass immigration to the Soviet Union including 10000 to 15000 from Finland and thousands more from Poland Sweden Germany and other nearby countries The Kremlin was at first happy to help these immigrants settle believing that they were victims of capitalism who had come to help the Soviet cause However by 1933 the worst of the Depression had come to an end in many countries and word had been received that illegal migrants to the Soviet Union were being sent to Siberia These factors caused immigration to the Soviet Union to slow significantly and roughly a tenth of Finnish migrants returned to Finland either legally or illegally Spain Spain had a relatively isolated economy with high protective tariffs and was not one of the main countries affected by the Depression The banking system held up well as did agriculture By far the most serious negative impact came after 1936 from the heavy destruction of infrastructure and manpower by the civil war 193639 Many talented workers were forced into permanent exile By staying neutral in the Second World War and selling to both sides the economy avoided further disasters Sweden By the 1930s Sweden had what Americas Life magazine called in 1938 the worlds highest standard of living Sweden was also the first country worldwide to recover completely from the Great Depression Taking place amid a shortlived government and a lessthanadecade old Swedish democracy events such as those surrounding Ivar Kreuger who eventually committed suicide remain infamous in Swedish history The Social Democrats under Per Albin Hansson formed their first longlived government in 1932 based on strong interventionist and welfare state policies monopolizing the office of Prime Minister until 1976 with the sole and shortlived exception of Axel PehrssonBramstorps summer cabinet in 1936 During forty years of hegemony it was the most successful political party in the history of Western liberal democracy Thailand In Thailand then known as the Kingdom of Siam the Great Depression contributed to the end of the absolute monarchy of King Rama VII in the Siamese revolution of 1932 Turkey Turkey was badly affected by the Great Depression and it came at a time when the state was still reforming its economic policy following the end of the Ottoman era Exports of grapes which held an important share were down considerably which had already started beforehand due to drought United Kingdom The World Depression broke at a time when the United Kingdom had still not fully recovered from the effects of the First World War more than a decade earlier The country was driven off the gold standard in 1931 The world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain in 1931 investors around the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of 25 million per day Credits of 25 million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of 15 million fiduciary note slowed but did not reverse the British crisis The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931 With deficits mounting the bankers demanded a balanced budget the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonalds Labour government agreed it proposed to raise taxes cut spending and most controversially to cut unemployment benefits by 20 The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement MacDonald wanted to resign but King George V insisted he remain and form an allparty coalition National Government The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on along with a small cadre of Labour but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government Britain went off the gold standard and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression In the 1931 British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed leaving MacDonald as prime minister for a largely Conservative coalition The effects on the northern industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed By the end of 1930 unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 25 million 20 of the insured workforce and exports had fallen in value by 50 In 1933 30 of Glaswegians were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry In some towns and cities in the north east unemployment reached as high as 70 as shipbuilding fell by 90 The National Hunger March of SeptemberOctober 1932 was the largest of a series of hunger marches in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s About 200000 unemployed men were sent to the work camps which continued in operation until 1939 In the less industrial Midlands and Southern England the effects were shortlived and the later 1930s were a prosperous time Growth in modern manufacture of electrical goods and a boom in the motor car industry was helped by a growing southern population and an expanding middle class Agriculture also saw a boom during this period United States Hoovers first measures to combat the depression were based on encouraging businesses not to reduce their workforce or cut wages but businesses had little choice wages were reduced workers were laid off and investments postponed In June 1930 Congress approved the SmootHawley Tariff Act which raised tariffs on thousands of imported items The intent of the Act was to encourage the purchase of Americanmade products by increasing the cost of imported goods while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers Most countries that traded with the US increased tariffs on Americanmade goods in retaliation reducing international trade and worsening the Depression In 1931 Hoover urged bankers to set up the National Credit Corporation so that big banks could help failing banks survive But bankers were reluctant to invest in failing banks and the National Credit Corporation did almost nothing to address the problem By 1932 unemployment had reached 236 peaking in early 1933 at 25 Those released from prison during this period had an especially difficult time finding employment given the stigma of their criminal records which often led to recidivism out of economic desperation Drought persisted in the agricultural heartland businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans and more than 5000 banks had failed Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless and began congregating in shanty towns dubbed Hoovervilles that began to appear across the country In response President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to spur new home construction and reduce foreclosures The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act ERA which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation RFC in 1932 The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to 2 billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions But 2 billion was not enough to save all the banks and bank runs and bank failures continued Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill as prices profits and employment fell leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt Shortly after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933 drought and erosion combined to cause the Dust Bowl shifting hundreds of thousands of displaced persons off their farms in the Midwest From his inauguration onward Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one New Deal programs sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms During a bank holiday that lasted five days the Emergency Banking Act was signed into law It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision with federal loans available if needed The Securities Act of 1933 comprehensively regulated the securities industry This was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which created the Securities and Exchange Commission Although amended key provisions of both Acts are still in force Federal insurance of bank deposits was provided by the FDIC and the GlassSteagall Act The Agricultural Adjustment Act provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices The National Recovery Administration NRA made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy It forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA to fight deflationary cutthroat competition by the setting of minimum prices and wages labor standards and competitive conditions in all industries It encouraged unions that would raise wages to increase the purchasing power of the working class The NRA was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1935 These reforms together with several other relief and recovery measures are called the First New Deal Economic stimulus was attempted through a new alphabet soup of agencies set up in 1933 and 1934 and previously extant agencies such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation By 1935 the Second New Deal added Social Security which was later considerably extended through the Fair Deal a jobs program for the unemployed the Works Progress Administration WPA and through the National Labor Relations Board a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions In 1929 federal expenditures constituted only 3 of the GDP The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from 20 to 40 Roosevelt kept it at 40 until the war began when it soared to 128 By 1936 the main economic indicators had regained the levels of the late 1920s except for unemployment which remained high at 11 although this was considerably lower than the 25 unemployment rate seen in 1933 In the spring of 1937 American industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until June 1937 In June 1937 the Roosevelt administration cut spending and increased taxation in an attempt to balance the federal budget The American economy then took a sharp downturn lasting for 13 months through most of 1938 Industrial production fell almost 30 per cent within a few months and production of durable goods fell even faster Unemployment jumped from 143 in 1937 to 190 in 1938 rising from 5 million to more than 12 million in early 1938 Manufacturing output fell by 37 from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods and inventories declined but personal income was only 15 lower than it had been at the peak in 1937 As unemployment rose consumers expenditures declined leading to further cutbacks in production By May 1938 retail sales began to increase employment improved and industrial production turned up after June 1938 After the recovery from the Recession of 193738 conservatives were able to form a bipartisan conservative coalition to stop further expansion of the New Deal and when unemployment dropped to 2 in the early 1940s they abolished WPA CCC and the PWA relief programs Social Security remained in place Between 1933 and 1939 federal expenditure tripled and Roosevelts critics charged that he was turning America into a socialist state The Great Depression was a main factor in the implementation of social democracy and planned economies in European countries after World War II see Marshall Plan Keynesianism generally remained the most influential economic school in the United States and in parts of Europe until the periods between the 1970s and the 1980s when Milton Friedman and other neoliberal economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of neoliberalism and incorporated them into the Chicago School of Economics as an alternative approach to the study of economics Neoliberalism went on to challenge the dominance of the Keynesian school of Economics in the mainstream academia and policymaking in the United States having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom Literature The Great Depression has been the subject of much writing as authors have sought to evaluate an era that caused both financial and emotional trauma Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is The Grapes of Wrath published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the work and in 1962 was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought economic hardship and changes in the agricultural industry occur during the Great Depression Steinbecks Of Mice and Men is another important novella about a journey during the Great Depression Additionally Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird is set during the Great Depression Margaret Atwoods Booker prizewinning The Blind Assassin is likewise set in the Great Depression centering on a privileged socialites love affair with a Marxist revolutionary The era spurred the resurgence of social realism practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs especially the Federal Writers Project in the US Nonfiction works from this time also capture important themes The 1933 memoir Prison Days and Nights by Victor Folke Nelson provides insight into criminal justice ramifications of the Great Depression especially in regard to patterns of recidivism due to lack of economic opportunity A number of works for younger audiences are also set during the Great Depression among them the Kit Kittredge series of American Girl books written by Valerie Tripp and illustrated by Walter Rane released to tie in with the dolls and playsets sold by the company The stories which take place during the early to mid 1930s in Cincinnati focuses on the changes brought by the Depression to the titular characters family and how the Kittredges dealt with it A theatrical adaptation of the series entitled Kit Kittredge An American Girl was later released in 2008 to positive reviews Similarly Christmas After All part of the Dear America series of books for older girls take place in 1930s Indianapolis while Kit Kittredge is told in a thirdperson viewpoint Christmas After All is in the form of a fictional journal as told by the protagonist Minnie Swift as she recounts her experiences during the era especially when her family takes in an orphan cousin from Texas Naming The term The Great Depression is most frequently attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins whose 1934 book The Great Depression is credited with formalizing the phrase though Hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term informally referring to the downturn as a depression with such uses as Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement December 1930 Message to Congress and I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression 1931 The term depression to refer to an economic downturn dates to the 19th century when it was used by varied Americans and British politicians and economists The first major American economic crisis the Panic of 1819 was described by thenpresident James Monroe as a depression and the most recent economic crisis the Depression of 192021 had been referred to as a depression by thenpresident Calvin Coolidge Financial crises were traditionally referred to as panics most recently the major Panic of 1907 and the minor Panic of 191011 though the 1929 crisis was called The Crash and the term panic has since fallen out of use At the time of the Great Depression the term The Great Depression was already used to refer to the period 187396 in the United Kingdom or more narrowly 187379 in the United States which has retroactively been renamed the Long Depression Other great depressions The collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakdown of economic ties which followed led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standards of living in the 1990s in postSoviet states and the former Eastern Bloc which was even worse than the Great Depression Even before Russias financial crisis of 1998 Russias GDP was half of what it had been in the early 1990s Comparison with the Great Recession The worldwide economic decline after 2008 has been compared to the 1930s The causes of the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression but significant differences exist The thenchairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke had extensively studied the Great Depression as part of his doctoral work at MIT and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s Bernankes policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come as economists debate the wisdom of his choices In 2011 one journalist contrasted the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late2000s recession 1928 and 1929 were the times in the 20th century that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes half the unemployed had been out of work for over six months something that was not repeated until the late2000s recession 2007 and 2008 eventually saw the world reach new levels of wealth gap inequality that rivalled the years of 1928 and 1929 See also General References Further reading Global Brendon Piers The
